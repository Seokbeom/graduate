<i>A road that doesn't open isn't a road.</i>

4
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,890
<i>Roads are open to everyone.</i>

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,800
<i>But not everyone can have the roads.</i>

- Did you find him?

7
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,180
<i>Cairo Hotel.</i>

8
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,170
I'll see you at the hotel entrance.

9
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,200
<i>Mr. Jang Geu Rae!</i>

10
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,080
Oh!

11
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,300
You were right.

12
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,100
We thought he'd be
 in a premium hotel.

13
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,480
That's why we couldn't find him 
in all the Jordan hotels.

14
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
It wasn't sold yet, right?

15
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,320
Right, let's hope it 
ends in a civil way.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,320
Let's go.

17
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,110
Maybe he checked out.

18
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,780
Mr. Seo.

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,440
Mr. Seo!

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,020

Wow.

29
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,360
Wrap up now.

30
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,260
Being too fussy is an illness.

31
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,860
Yes, sir.

32
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,400
Uh…

33
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,460
Mr. Jang's leg is all better now.

34
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
Huh?

35
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,320
Oh, I see.

36
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,940
Then tomorrow he'll come in…?

37
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,000
It's time you quit.

38
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,720
Will you do dead-end 
part-time jobs forever?

39
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,940
You got discharged from 
the army ages ago.

40
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,420
Are you looking for a job?

41
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,820
Yes.

42
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,980
It's hard, huh?

43
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,520
Should I look for 
a go club opening?

44
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,060
No.

45
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,940
But that's what you 
know how to do…

46
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,860
It's ok.

47
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,480
Alright.

48
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,100
Take your daily pay.

49
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,900
You still work as a driver 
early in the morning?

50
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,840
Yes.

51
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,440
Alright.

52
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,060
I'll be there in a couple minutes.

53
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,520
Where are you exactly?

54
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,740
Huh?

55
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,570
It's ok.

56
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,280
Go straight from Shinnonhyeon 
Station exit no. 6, then what?

57
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,300
Yes.

58
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,040
I'll be right there, sir.

59
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,380
A young guy should work hard...

60
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,710
...not sit behind the comfy wheel.

61
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,560
You can't get my money that easily.

62
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,380
Take that.

63
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,040
I'm so worried about 
Korea, I can't sleep.

64
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,330
This is only $50…

65
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,780
Mom.

66
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,260
Why aren't you sleeping?

67
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,920
<i>Are you still working?</i>

68
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,160
Go to bed.

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,480
I'm getting a call, bye.

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,020
Yes.

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,820
<i>I got a call from there 
this evening.</i>

73
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,640
<i>They want you to start tomorrow.</i>

74
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,560
The old suit is too small, isn't it?

75
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
That will be better.

76
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,620
That's the best suit 
among your dad's.

77
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,080
Just wear it for today.

78
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,480
I'll buy you a new one.

79
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,100
Buy a cheap one.

80
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,220
Of course.

81
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,040
A cheap new suit.

82
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
Be confident.

83
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,230
You're super smart.

84
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,960
You were the top in your class.

85
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,220
You thought way 
ahead of your peers.

86
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,880
Don't think I bribed them.

87
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Nothing like that happened.

88
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,420
Mom.

89
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,240
Spell "bribe."

90
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,840
Does that start with a "v" or a "b"?

91
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
It's ok.

92
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,760
Sungwon's CEO wouldn't 
have given them...

93
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,920
...your referral if you weren't good.

94
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,640
I'm sure they checked 
you out thoroughly.

95
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,120
So be confident!

96
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,280
Hey, come here.

97
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,960
Yes, here it is.

98
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,060
Look at this.

99
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,420
Do a better job.

100
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,620
Yes, sir.

101
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
Hey.

102
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,460
Yes.

103
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,310
Come out.

104
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,120
Your name was...?

105
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,600
Jang Geu Rae.

106
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,420
R-E?

107
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
No, R-A-E.

108
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,040
Your age?

109
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,820
26.

110
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,840
You only got your GED.

111
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,050
Yes.

112
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,560
Did you drop out of 
high school or something?

113
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,060
I didn't go.

114
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,440
Why not?

115
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,860
Any work experience?

116
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,420
Any foreign languages?

117
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,780
No.

118
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,060
I have a CA license.

119
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,750
Computer application?

120
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,960
Yes.

121
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,260
Good job.

122
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,390
That's it?

123
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,290
- Yes.
- Yes?

124
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,500
Ok.

125
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,180
I'm Kim Dong Sik 
in Sales team 3.

126
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,180

127
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,630
Let's go.

128
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,240
What did you do for 26 years?

129
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,140
You can't do anything?

130
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,320
That's rare these days.

131
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,460
Let's go.

132
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,680
<i>I know.</i>

133
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,460
<i>What did I do for 26 years?</i>

134
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,640
Amazing.

135
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,020
You ok?

136
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,670
You choked yourself.

137
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,480
I can't watch this!

138
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,960
Ouch.

139
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,900
It's ready.

140
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,040
Ok.

141
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,600
Must we do this?

142
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,240
You think this is 
the only way, right?

143
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,520
Yes, that's what I think.

144
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
I think differently.

145
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,020
The Lux & Rich CEO might not 
like you approaching like this.

146
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,380
I'll give it a go.

147
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,350
You wore that.

148
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,180
Breast pads…

149
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,140
Amazing.

150
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,820
I'll be right there.

151
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Ok.

152
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,000
Good job.

153
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,100
She took it out right away.

154
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,780
You sure she's only an intern 
who's here 10 days?

155
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,480
She's the best intern.

156
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,600
Erase the visuals from 
your head, ok?

157
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,540
Of course.

158
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,270
I'll delete that from my memory.

159
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,500
Please send it to me, sir.

160
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,350
I'll check and confirm right away.

161
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,860
Thank you.

162
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,300
Bye.

163
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,120
Thank you, One Inter…

164
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,000
Hi, sir.

165
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Did you get home ok last night?

166
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,540
Yes.
Of course, I'm fine.

167
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,460
Mr. Oh will be here tomorrow.

168
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,370
The company wanted to 
know how much...

169
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,980
...stock will be necessary 
for next month.

170
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,240
Please check and let me know.

171
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,000
Thank you.

172
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,760
Where was it?

173
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,740
Why are you standing around?

174
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,260
Ok.

175
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,420
Catalog…

176
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,130
There it is.

177
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,650
What?

178
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,680
This is the only brochure?

179
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Geez.

180
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,790
This is Dong Sik.

181
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,220
How come you sent
 just this brochure?

182
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,660
Yes.

183
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,160
There's no inner paper.

184
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll be right there.

185
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,260
Okay.

186
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,740
You should have in 
come today, boss…

187
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,610
What?

188
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,420
Why do you keep moving about?

189
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sorry.

190

192
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,650
Sure.

193
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,960
I'm sure you've made copies 
in the past 26 years.

194

Ok.

198
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,340
One each.

201

send him over.</i>

Yes, he's here.

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,050

213

00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,440
Thanks.

557
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,380
Right, I told you.

558
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,880
Hello.

559
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,850
Hey, man.

560
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,840
I said I was coming in today.

561
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,680
Why'd they send him today too?

562
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,060
There was a miscommunication.

563
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,060
9:30, Kings Hotel café.

564
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,440
I can't make it!

565
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,440
It's rush hour!

566
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,100
I was told you have to be there, 
no matter what.

567
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,030
I have to leave soon
 because of the...

568
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,600
...squids and come back tonight.

569
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,860
Bye.

570
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,410
<i>Traffic report in the morning.</i>

571
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,150
<i>Today's traffic is heavy.</i>

572
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,250
<i>The 405 is extremely jammed.</i>

573
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,650
<i>The right side of Olympic Highway is...</i>

574
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,130
500 meters in 30 minutes.

575
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,100
Huh?

576
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,500
Oh, no.

577
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,750
It's taking forever!

578
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:39,720
Where are you?

579
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,740
Dong Sik.

580
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,560
We have to get accustomed 
to the unfamiliar.

581
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:55,160
That way we can have
 a new experience.

582
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,670
We should move a step 
away from the fear.

583
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:03,160
Sir, I was told you have to be on 
your toes or you'll be fired.

584
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,060
I'm currently moving 12km/hour.

585
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,880
8km away from the meeting location.

586
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,050
I need 50 more minutes.

587
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,980
I'll be 30 minutes late 
for the meeting.

588
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,980
30 minutes?

589
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,260
I'll hang up for a minute.

590
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,680
Bye.

591
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,020
What's the department
 manager's number?

592
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,620
Where is it?

593
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,580
Here you go.

594
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,800
Ok.

595
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,780
Department Manager...

596
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,610
Hi, this is Dong Sik.

597
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,120
Mr. Oh will be 30…

598
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,000
Huh?

599
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,740
But…

600
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,380
He doesn't know anything.

601
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,700
Yes, sir.

602
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,760
Geu Rae.

603
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,840
Yes.

604
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,620
You have to go.

605
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,620
Huh?

606
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,800
Crazy, huh?

607
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,060
But there's no other way.

608
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,060
Ok.

609
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:17,480
You have to be with him 
until Mr. Oh gets there.

610
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,320
Here, ginseng…

611
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,520
Ging…

612
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,790
Ginseng sample rice cakes.

613
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,320
Here.

614
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,090
Show them you're useful even if 
you weren't for the past 26 years.

615
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,620
Go.

616
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,700
Ok.

617
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,040
Show him the…

618
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,500
Never mind. He can't.

619
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,060
What?

620
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,380
Yay!

621
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,140
Never mind.

622
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,440
What's good?

623
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,660
Maybe I'll write letters 
of apology in advance.

624
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,800
For me and Mr. Oh.

625
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,860
I'm in deep trouble.

626
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,360
It'll help if I write proper letters.

627
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,020
<i>I knew it.</i>

628
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,700
<i>Would I…</i>

629
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,840
You have to be with him.

630
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,680
<i>…have a solution?</i>

631
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,980
Hey!

632
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,960
How could you send him?

633
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,520
Dang!

634
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,400
He can't even speak English!

635
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,740
<i>He already left with the car,
 the rest is up to fate.</i>

636
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,920
Bye.

637
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,480
Let's see if he pulls it off or not.

638
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,280
What's he doing?

639
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,460
Quiz?

640
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,380
Go, sir.

641
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,560
Go?

642
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,320
Go, right?

643
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,420
No, "baduk."

644
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,860
You taught him go?

645
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,880
Yes.

646
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,640
You're good?

647
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,640
No.

648
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,360
I know up to here.

649
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,940
<i>That's only thing I can do.</i>

650
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,470
I was saved by the bell.

651
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,770
Interesting kid.

652
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,210
Ok.
I understand you have a GED.

653
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:54,100
But you can't speak any foreign 
languages or have any skills or specifications.

654
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,100
That's rare these days.

655
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,960
What did you do 
before you came here?

656
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,280
Nothing, sir.

657
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,860
So you want to start now at 26?

658
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:10,830
Yes.

659
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,540
You know you're really lucky?

660
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:19,640
Huh?

661
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,460
I wouldn't have let them hire you
 had I been there.

662
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,320
Even if you were Obama's son.

663
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,160
I need someone to get the 
buyer to sign a contract now.

664
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,200
Someone we don't have to teach.

665
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,520
I'm sorry.

666
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:41,380
I can have you fired right away.

667
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,000
Mr. Oh.

668
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,430
Captivate me.

669
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,260
Huh?

670
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,900
Sell yourself.

671
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,670
What have you got?

672
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,240
<i>My something.</i>

673
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,370
<i>My one thing.</i>

674
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,500
Nothing?

675
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,180
<i>Something I'm good at.</i>

676
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,600
- Nothing, right?
- Effort.

677
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,260
So…

678
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,880
I've never worked hard, 
so my effort...

679
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,380
...is unused and 
ultra brand new.

680
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,160
Say what?

681
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,620
I'll work hard.

682
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,200
I'll do my best.

683
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,030
I'm not buying you.

684
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:33,880
Hi.

685
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,360
Hi, Dong Sik.

686
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,540
It went fine.

687
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,760
It worked out.

688
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,620
Regarding the complaint 
from Malaysia…

689
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,720
We can't pay for that!

690
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,680
What?

691
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,580
It was that contract.

692
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,670
I'm right.

693
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,320
That was sufficient, you know.

694
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,570
No, it was their fault, 
so we won't pay.

695
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:09,340
Who do they take us for?

696
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,560
Yeah.

697
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,750
Bye.

698
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,200
You know why I'm not buying?

699
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,900
Hard-working guys are 
everywhere at work.

700
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,140
So you're no different.

701
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,560
My effort is different.

702
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,780
Yeah?

703
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,860
How so?

704
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,040
The quality.

705
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,700
Huh?

706
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,970
<i>I don't know what I'm talking about.</i>
Quantity too.

707
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:51,820
Ok, let's see how 
different you are.

708
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,320
This is our team's data.

709
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,160
The folders are there, 
so organize it.

710
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,420
Yes.

711
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,000
Can you do it?

712
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,300
Yes, sir.

713
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,800
- Go on.
- Yes.

714
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,440
Ultra brand new effort with 
high quality and quantity?

715
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,140
It's a new product, right?

716
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,800
Yes, it is.

717
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,600
You can pay in 6 months' 
installments.

718
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,600
I don't have a credit card.

719
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,100
You're sure it's new?

720
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,570
<i>It's all mixed up.</i>

721
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,570
<i>But…</i>

722
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,660
<i>…even that could come in handy.</i>

723
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:26,380
<i>Decide on a topic first...</i>

724
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,780
<i>...and add the content as you go.</i>

725
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,590
<i>There are some iffy files...</i>

726
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,060
<i>...which don't belong to anywhere.</i>

727
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,610
Mom!

728
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,400
What brings you here?

729
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,680
I'm busy now.

730
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,240
Change into this.

731
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,580
Mom.

732
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:17,430
You'll see when you 
become a dad.

733
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:23,700
When your kid suffers, 
you can't stop crying.

734
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,180
I'll get going.

735
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,680
Take a taxi.

736
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,100
Yeah, right.

737
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,500
Have you eaten?

738
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,080
Of course!

739
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,960
Young Yi.

740
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:51,360
She gave it, huh?

741
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,980
Hi.

742
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,060
Your team pulled it off.

743
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:59,830
- Mr. Oh.
- Just sit down.

744
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,040
Thank you for this.

745
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,280
No problem.

746
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,460
You have something to say?

747
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,580
Nothing.

748
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,740
- Hey.
- Yes.

749
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,000
- You know what team I'm in, right?
- Yes.

750
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,420
You know we do 
everything, right?

751
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,480
You can learn a lot.

752
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,680
Yes.

753
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,940
Keep that in your mind
when your internship ends.

754
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,330
Think "I want Sales team 3."

755
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,840
So long.

756
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,060
Bye.

757
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:54,950
<i>When your kid suffers...</i>

758
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:58,090
<i>...you can't stop crying.</i>

759
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,380
How are things going?

760
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,000
You even know what you're doing?

761
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,220
I'm doing my best.

762
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,360
That's for school.

763
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,440
Here you just bring the results.

764
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,600
Yes, sir.

765
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,980
Dong Sik.

766
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:16,040
<i>We'll have to check
 the fermented squid.</i>

767
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,740
Why?

768
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,280
They mixed octopus in again?

769
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,980
<i>- Yes, there's a problem here.</i>
- Again.

770
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,720
<i>They might have mixed 
in frozen octopus.</i>

771
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,700
Why, those octopus idiots!

772
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,380
<i>They're denying it, but 
I think they are pranking us.</i>

773
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,360
We need to check it today.

774
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,560
Ok.

775
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,200
Tell them we're manually checking and if 
it's mixed, we'll stop working with them.

776
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,580
<i>Ok.
Huh?</i>

777
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,600
<i>Manually?</i>

778
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,560
<i>There's not enough people there.</i>

779
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,700
- I'll tell each team leader, don't worry.
<i>- What? But...</i>

780
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,780
Why, those octopus idiots!

781
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,400
Is the manager in now?

782
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,420
Shall I call him?

783
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,990
He's connected.

784
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,340
Hi sir, this is Sang Sik.

785
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:12,880
Where are you?

786
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,820
I have to tell you something.

787
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,030
Yes.

788
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,100
Yes, sir.

789
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,270
Bye.

790
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:56,140
I saw the request for help 
with the octopus case.

791
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,910
- Squid case.
- You must be so busy.

792
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:02,060
You just came back from abroad.

793
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,280
I'm on my toes already.

794
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,760
How come you have to cover 
for all the employees?

795
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,490
Aren't they hiring more people?

796
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,430
Oh, they hired someone, right?

797
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,120
Yes.

798
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,120
Send me someone good.

799
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,440
We're going to send fermented 
seafood to the U.S.

800
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:35,140
If frozen octopus is mixed in, 
is it fermented squid or octopus?

801
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,960
It doesn't matter which 
is more expensive.

802
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,800
The purity of the product is key.

803
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,620
If octopus is mixed in, octopus 
would embarrass One International.

804
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,380
Find all the octopus.

805
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,960
What's with you?

806
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,260
I didn't ask you to sell 
coolers in Siberia.

807
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,770
Yes.

808
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:03,030
Baek Ki.

809
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,820
I'll call the factory, so proceed.

810
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,300
Yes, sir.

811
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:16,000
Gosh, I'm confused.

812
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,850
Is this our job?

813
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:20,990
I heard you help when
 they lack manpower.

814
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:25,480
Yeah, one guy requested
 to work at a site.

815
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:29,060
But not a fermented 
seafood factory.

816
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:33,060
But Young Yi doesn't have to go
 since she's a woman?

817
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,720
Her team leader had them go.

818
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,830
See?

819
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,540
There are other kind of people for this.

820
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,980
Yes, sir.

821
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,180
Alright.

822
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,800
Bye.

823
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,380
What's this?

824
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,540
Mr. Oh.

825
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,340
Geu Rae.

826
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,710
What's with this?

827
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,710
Where's the one I made?

828
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:26,780
I made it different to 
organize the iffy files.

829
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,050
Will that be ok?

830
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,320
No.

831
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,580
You have no friends, huh?

832
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,460
Huh?

833
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,830
It looks like a diary for yourself.

834
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:47,300
I didn't have high hopes anyway.

835
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,000
Geu Rae.

836
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,280
Let's go.

837
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,480
Sorry we lack work uniforms.

838
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,780
We can't work like this.

839
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,780
Why'd you come then?

840
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,060
Make sure to keep it clean.

841
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,710
It's cold, so you'll need your clothes.

842
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,040
Follow me.

843
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:39,300
There's no time and 
we can't help it either.

844
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:44,360
There are three 3.5-ton 
and two 4.5-ton trucks.

845
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:49,860
Go in pairs and check 
for them inside.

846
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:54,700
Do it ASAP before 
the seafood goes bad.

847
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,300
Get into pairs.
Come on.

848
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,750
It'll be tough by yourself.

849
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,960
Go on in.

850
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,560
There are fewer here.

851
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,130
Come on.

852
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:36,220
It's freezing.

853
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,860
It stinks.

854
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:41,230
I didn't study TOEIC to do this.

855
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:43,060
I know.

856
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:46,400
I don't like this company.

857
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,370
Let's take our time.

858
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,280
Octopus.

859
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,880
Geez.

860
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,740
Hello?

861
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,680
Hi, Mr. Oh.

862
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,100
Yes, sir.

863
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,720
I'll do that.

864
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,570
Yes, sir.

865
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,540
Let's go.

866
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,510
Huh?

867
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:22,320
The Chinese company admitted 
to their wrongdoing.

868
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,540
Sales team 3 will treat 
us for the hard work.

869
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,340
We better hurry to the sauna.

870
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,860
I'll tell Geu Rae…

871
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,960
- You don't know the sauna, do you?
- No.

872
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,790
Tell Geu Rae and 
come in that car.

873
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:34,860
Me?

874
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,720
Man…

875
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,880
He's working so hard.

876
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,880
He should at least work hard.

877
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,780
Geu Rae…

878
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,490
Hey.

879
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:04,220
Let's go, Geu Rae.

880
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,460
We called you.

881
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,630
Let's make an unforgettable 
memory for him.

882
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,240
Where's Geu Rae?

883
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,240
He's still working.

884
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,080
Huh?

885
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,060
What's wrong with you?

886
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,980
He won't pick up.

887
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:06,220
<i>Please leave a message…</i>

888
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,220
I'll call the factory.

889
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:19,460
We shouldn't have done that.

890
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,240
You thought Baek Ki 
wouldn't know?

891
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,180
Huh?

892
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,260
You're still here?

893
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,600
Hey!

894
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,510
Oh, my!

895
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:33,810
Yes!

896
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,540
Didn't you hear the news?

897
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,920
Look.
They're all gone.

898
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,920
Why are you still here?

899
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,220
Gone?

900
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:47,740
They left long ago after they heard 
they don’t have to do it.

901
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,520
Gosh, all the cars are gone too.

902
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,100
How come only you're left here?

903
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:11,520
<i>We have no cars and it's 
hard to catch taxis here.</i>

904
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:28,760
<i>How come only you're left here?</i>

905
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,060
Geu Rae…

906
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,800
Hello.

907
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,400
Hello?

908
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,120
<i>You're still working?</i>

909
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,360
<i>Come on.</i>

910
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,630
Geu Rae's here.

911
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:42,740
<i>Oh, put him on.</i>

912
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,260
Here.

913
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,040
Hello?

914
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,760
<i>Why didn't you pick up?</i>

915
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,160
<i>It's Geu Rae.</i>

916
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,840
<i>Geu Rae.</i>

917
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,060
<i>He must've made it.</i>

918
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,780
Yes, it so happened.

919
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:06,240
<i>The factory owner told you?</i>

920
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,800
<i>It was a prank.</i>

921
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,360
<i>Sorry, Geu Rae!</i>

922
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,580
<i>Newcomers go through that.</i>

923
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,000
<i>Come with Young Yi.</i>

924
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,060
<i>Can I talk to her?</i>

925
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,840
<i>He must've been 
searching till now.</i>

926
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,160
<i>He's a fool.</i>

927
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,000
Hello?

928
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,320
Yes, I know.

929
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,280
He said, come together.

930
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,440
You want to go?

931
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:43,100
Yes.

932
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,200
I'll see the end of this.

933
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,280
Oh…

934
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,000
You stink.

935
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,280
Geu Rae.

936
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,460
You should've washed up.

937
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:11,280
Did you get some for the pay?

938
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:15,160
Why didn't you pick up?

939
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,360
I called so many times.

940
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,390
Where's Mr. Oh? I have to report...

941
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,760
He'll come back soon.

942
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,720
<i>You stink.</i>

943
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:30,310
<i>Go wash up at a sauna.</i>

944
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,980
What's with him?

945
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,880
But your clothes stink.

946
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,900
Why'd you work so hard?

947
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,550
You should've been
 smart about it.

948
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,390
I guess you'll have 
to work hard at least.

949
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,390
Keep working hard.

950
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:55,440
Let's go in.

951
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,760
I have to go since it's late.

952
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,580
I just came to say bye.

953
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,410
Mr. Oh.

954
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,100
Hi.

955
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,480
Hello.

956
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,580
Good job.

957
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,120
I'll get going.

958
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,580
Bye.

959
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,700
Hello.

960
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,360
What's with you?

961
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:25,420
Something happened.

962
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,420
What?

963
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:31,240
I have to wrap up 
some work too.

964
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,440
I came to say bye.

965
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,540
What do you have…

966
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,640
You're going for that?

967
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,860
Yes, I'll redo it since I messed up.

968
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:42,760
You can do it tomorrow.

969
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,280
So go eat or go home.

970
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,600
Don’t go back to work.

971
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,800
It's ok.

972
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,520
It'll be ready for tomorrow.

973
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,180
<i>You say I work hard?</i>

974
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,180
No.

975
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,680
<i>I'm here now because
 I didn't work hard.</i>

976
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:08,160
<i>I was abandoned because
 I didn't work hard.</i>

977
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,950
[Misaeng]

978
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:33,280
<i>You know whose
 connections he used?</i>

979
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,020
Who?
Who?

980
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,180
Let's go it.

981
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,160
<i>Executive director.</i>

982
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,800
<i>Did you decide on your partner?</i>

983
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,100
<i>You have everything 
other interns want.</i>

984
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,740
You're popular.

985
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:47,260
<i>Make sure you know 
who approaches you.</i>

986
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:50,010
I'm Han Suk Yool of
 the Fabric team.

987
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:55,660
We got in trouble 
because of that!

988
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:57,880
It feels weird watching that.

989
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,600
<i>It makes me want to do well.</i>

990
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,760
<i>Then what should I do?</i>

991
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,980
<i>You can teach me.</i>

992
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,220
Give me a chance.

993
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:07,820
I don't support a world where those 
with no basics get on the escalator.

994
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,720
Get out, dude!

995
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,740
<i>I'm alone here too.</i>

996
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
