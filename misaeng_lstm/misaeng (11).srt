What will happen to Mr. Park?

24
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,630
Apparently, it's the biggest 
scandal in the company's history.

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,140
Two sexual harassment

371
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,560
won't end with a pay cut.

372
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,760
What?

373
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,140
What did you just say?

374
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,260
Hey!

375
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,830
Why, that…

376
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,620
Mr. Ma will tell you 
if he needs anything,

377
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,100
so just proceed as scheduled.

378
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,430
I'll take care of Mr. Ma's 
approvals from now on,

379
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,840
so I'll take over anything 
he asks you to do.

380
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,850
Yes.

381
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,300
When you spoke with Mr. Oh,

382
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,640
did he mention who 
would go to Team 3?

383
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,100
I heard an assistant 
manager might go.

384
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,260
Why?

385
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,260
I don't want to go to that team.

386
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,360
I want to work under 
you for a long time.

387
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,060
I can't send you.

388
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,950
Ms. Sun.

389
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,950
The person to go has been decided.

390
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,130
[Personnel appointment]

391
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,640
Good news.

392
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,180
Mr. Chun is coming.

393
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,000
What's he like?

394
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,900
Don't worry, he's normal.

395
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,770
He's experienced with the Middle East, 
although not as much as Mr. Park.

396
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,420
He used to work for Sales Team 3.

397
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,920
It was his first dept. as 
an experienced employee.

398
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,650
I…

399
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,100
became exhausted by a bad boss,

400
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,950
so we relied on each other.

401
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,780
We worked hard under Mr. Oh.

402
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,260
Lots of good memories.

403
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,880
How are experienced positions 
and open recruitment different?

404
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,540
First of all, they don’t 
have someone like you.

405
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,860
Someone they entered the 
company with and can talk to.

406
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,620
Weak support base too.

407
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,620
He wanted to come in this atmosphere.

408
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,520
Maybe he missed old colleagues.

409
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,200
You have a big belly.

410
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,280
Mr. Chun!

411
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,500
You're already here.

412
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,700
Dong Sik.

413
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,020
I mean Mr. Kim.

414
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,520
-How are you?
-Yes.

415
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,160
Hi, Mr. Chun!

416
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,640
Mr. Oh.

417
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,720
I came to say hello in advance.
I look forward to working with you.

418
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,300
Why are you so tense?
Come on.

419
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,680
You're acting weird.

420
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,200
He's a newbie in our team.

421
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
Hi.

422
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,640
I'm Jang Geu Rae.

423
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,760
Nice to meet you.

424
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,310
You came to say hi and 
organized your desk?

425
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,560
Boxes…

426
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,760
You want to sit here?

427
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,560
Then I'll go say bye 
to my previous team.

428
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,760
<i>Mr. Chun Gwan Woong, age 37.</i>

429
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,120
That's my desk.

430
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,500
<i>He organized his desk 
as soon as he came.</i>

431
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,460
<i>All the items were in place 
as if they belonged there.</i>

432
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,510
<i>I thought the man taking Mr. Park's</i>

433
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,950
<i>place would make 
things relatively easy.</i>

434
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,260
<i>Instead, he created
 a tense atmosphere.</i>

435
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,000
-Dong Sik.
-Yes.

436
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,840
Go to the Life Supplies team

437
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,820
for some samples with Geu Rae.

438
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,140
Yes.

439
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,310
Sir.

440
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,800
What about the polyester case?

441
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,300
Why should I do that?

442
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,800
Wasn’t a half-day off enough, 
why are you still upset?

443
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,660
Didn’t I tell you that's your job?

444
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,860
Come here, Suk Yool.

445
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,340
Is that right?

446
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,620
What is it?

447
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,900
Instead of a banker's usance, 
you wrote a shipper's usance!

448
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,830
[Banker's Usance: the importer pays the draft interest till the maturity date]

449
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,000
[Shipper's Usance: the exporter pays the draft interest till the maturity date]

450
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,530
There are specific instances to use 
these terms in the polyester case!

451
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,540
If you had trained as I asked you 
to, you wouldn’t get this wrong!

452
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,130
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

453
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,980
I'll fix it.

454
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,440
Fixing it won't do.

455
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,980
Listen carefully.

456
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,660
People learn from mistakes.

457
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,740
I want you to know how I feel.

458
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,100
Read some self improvement books.

459
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,880
See what kind of seniors are good.

460
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,160
Don't get confused again.

461
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,880
Banker's, shipper's.
You're not going to pay the interest.

462
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,580
It's bigger than a month's salary 
and I don’t have money.

463
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,360
Banker's, shipper's, ok?

464
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,840
Banker's usance is 
paid by the importer

465
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,760
and shipper's usance, by the exporter.

466
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,250
Suk Yool met his match.

467
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,700
Mr. Sung won't be easy to beat.

468
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,800
What?

469
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,040
How do you memorize 
trade terms so well?

470
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,560
AOG.

471
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,660
The starting or payment
 expiration point

472
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,980
for a discount is when
 products arrive.

473
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,600
No hesitation, you're like a vending

474
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,900
machine and I pressed the vending

475
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,180
It's easy to memorize 
if you associate the terms.

476
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
It's just like playing Go.

477
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,720
According to you, you should

478
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,200
understand the core of proposals.

479
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,580
If you connect the dots, you can find

480
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,180
out the company's size 
or characteristics.

481
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,360
But you never get it 
and ask me again and again.

482
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,620
You're like that.

483
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,790
Do a good job, vending machine.

484
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,540
I'm sorry.

485
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,900
It's ok.

486
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,120
Huh?

487
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,200
Mr. Kang asked him to do it too.

488
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,000
What?

489
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,640
Making sentences concise.

490
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,500
He always trains newbies like that.

491
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,460
After that, the reports

492
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,040
become much easier to read.

493
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,630
What?

494
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,300
Why didn't you tell me 
how reports can improve?

495
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,630
Don't worry, I'll make you 
throw up while writing reports.

496
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,740
Are you Vladimir Michailovich Andreyev?

497
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,420
The report you sent is 
different from our request.

498
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,720
It's meant to set the emission

499
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,800
quantity by ton of CO2 equivalent.

500
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,960
The unit used is different

501
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,580
from what we had requested.

502
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,660
Did you make a mistake?

503
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,480
Yes, I'd appreciate it
 if you'd revise it.

504
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,260
-Young Yi.
-Yes.

505
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,180
Go bring my shoes on the way.

506
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,400
A pack of cigarettes for me.

507
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,120
You know what I smoke,

508
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,900
you bought peppermint 
instead last time.

509
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,560
How could you ask her to do that?

510
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,260
She has to send the mail.

511
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,620
Can I go after making some copies?

512
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,580
Why, that…

513
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,640
Oh, Young Yi.

514
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,800
Geu Rae.

515
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,700
Your fly's open.

516
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,200
Thanks for bowing.

517
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,040
You're so cruel.

518
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,140
How can you laugh when 
I'm sinking in a swamp?

519
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,760
-How?
-Suk Yool.

520
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,690
What are you doing here?

521
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,960
What are you laughing about?

522
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,520
Huh?

523
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm not that happy.

524
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,730
Shall we have a drink tonight?

525
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,000
A boss torments you in your face.

526
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,280
A boss treats me like trash.

527
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,360
A boss…

528
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,280
You know what's
 the worst type of boss?

529
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,040
Bosses that use juniors.

530
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,420
Bosses that slave juniors around,

531
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,600
give you their work, 
and take the credit.

532
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,740
But you know what's worse?

533
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,880
He… doesn’t know what he's doing,

534
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,280
I mean he's feigning ignorance.

535
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,840
I think he's feigning ignorance,

536
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,900
but everyone falls for him.

537
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,540
How does he do it?

538
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,980
Is everyone pure?

539
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,280
Especially Mr. Moon.

540
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,940
Is he blind or deaf?

541
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,000
Geez.

542
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,140
Answer your phone.

543
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,140
Answer it.

544
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,840
Hello?

545
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
<i>Suk Yool.</i>

546
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,860
<i>Han Suk Yool.</i>

547
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,220
What?

548
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,710
<i>I was wrong.</i>

549
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,030
<i>I've been thinking a lot.</i>

550
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,720
<i>You must have your reasons 
for acting this way.</i>

551
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,860
<i>Sorry for not being considerate.</i>

552
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,480
<i>Let's have a drink.</i>

553
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,540
<i>I mean let's have a serious talk.</i>

554
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,720
<i>Now!</i>

555
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,540
<i>Hey, man!</i>

556
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,940
<i>Suk Yool!</i>

557
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,460
Where are you now?

558
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,540
Go.

559
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,420
Why are you drinking 
alone looking pitiful?

560
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,120
Suk Yool!

561
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,020
Suk Yool!

562
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,380
Sit down.

563
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,700
Sit down.

564
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,870
Come on, sit.

565
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,640
Gosh, Suk Yool…

566
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,940
I know.

567
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
-Shall we leave?
-Huh?

568
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,680
Yes.

569
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,340
Geu Rae.

570
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,600
Your fly.

571
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,460
You can't fool me again.

572
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,360
It's true this time.

573
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,440
Thanks for bowing.

574
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,840
Let's go.

575
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,760
Why, that…

576
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,290
I'm a guy,

577
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,160
so I try to be understanding like

578
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,340
a guy when you ask me to do stuff.

579
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,380
Newbies should do everyone's work.

580
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,060
It's all your work, Suk Yool.

581
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,400
So I'll do what you ask me to.

582
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,370
So it's all your work.

583
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,110
Not mine, but yours.

584
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,560
So you're making me

585
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,150
do stuff to train me.

586
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,660
I understand that.

587
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,600
So I'm telling you now,

588
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,440
it's not my work, but yours!

589
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,440
Your work.

590
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,880
You're a total sociopath, aren't you?

591
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,920
Repeating the same thing 
over and over again…

592
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,080
Sociopath?

593
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,940
I'm a sociopath?

594
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,200
So I…

595
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,580
I wanted to be mentored 
by you and learn

596
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,150
properly like the other newbies.

597
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,700
So Suk Yool, that's why
 it's all your work.

598
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,500
Not mine, but yours.

599
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,180
I'm not saying I won't do it,

600
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,640
I will, but…

601
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,070
But you can't take

602
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,010
credit for what I did.

603
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,680
I think you should be 
considerate about that.

604
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,190
Suk Yool.

605
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,440
Yes.

606
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,660
You're a real sociopath.

607
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,130
Please listen to me, Sung!

608
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,360
Did you just call me by name "Sung"?

609
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,380
No…

610
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,410
Why, this…

611
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,560
You're not a sociopath, 
but a psychopath.

612
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,320
Psychopath?

613
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,820
I can't drink with you.

614
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,200
I don’t feel like drinking anymore.

615
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,740
Geez.

616
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,140
Sir.

617
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,840
Geez.

618
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,940
Please pay.

619
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,820
What?

620
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,320
Please pay.

621
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,240
$570

622
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,360
Why, that frigging jerk!

623
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,300
That frigging jerk!

624
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,240
Sorry about that…

625
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,420
Dang.

626
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,840
It's cold at night now.

627
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,430
You want my jacket?

628
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,820
It's ok.

629
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,940
Thanks.

630
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,140
You'll be happy with 
your future girlfriend.

631
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,180
Come on.

632
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,440
Don’t be so bashful.

633
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,200
I'm not bashful.

634
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,450
I'm just hot.

635
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,180
Fall and winter will pass by soon.

636
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,460
Spring will come soon.

637
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,730
Then it'll already be a year for us.

638
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,630
What?

639
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,210
Because of "us."

640
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,670
What?

641
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,960
Our kid got in trouble because

642
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,480
yours made a mistake!

643
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,900
<i>He called me "our kid."</i>

644
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,830
<i>"Our kid…"</i>

645
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:21,230
Last spring, I wanted to 
hear that word.

646
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,300
It'll be spring and already a year.

647
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,950
For us.

648
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,960
I'm hot.

649
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,530
Your ears are red now.

650
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,160
-My ears get red when I'm hot.
-I see.

651
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,660
It's true.

652
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,950
Oh.

653
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,780
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

654
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,790
I'm in your team from now on.

655
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,300
Hello.

656
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,480
Hi.

657
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,730
Geu Rae?

658
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,890
Yes.

659
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,930
I'll probably give you the most work.

660
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,570
Yes.

661
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,920
I'm not uptight, so you can relax.

662
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,900
We can get used to each other.

663
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,040
-Yes, thank you.
-Sure.

664
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,400
And…

665
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,760
Uh…

666
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:41,630
What will you do about your hair?

667
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,420
What?

668
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,650
It's too long.

669
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,640
I think you can cut it so it 
doesn't touch your collar.

670
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,990
Your bangs too.

671
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,590
What do you think?

672
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,060
I'll make my hair look neat.

673
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,400
You mean you'll cut it, right?

674
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,000
Cut…

675
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,180
Why are you acting like 
the dean of the students?

676
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,440
Like back in school…

677
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,770
Yeah.

678
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,200
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

679
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,440
-Let's have a briefing.
-Sure.

680
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,520
Let's go to the meeting room.

681
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
I can do it here.

682
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,280
We can catch up too, come on.

683
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,450
I know what you're doing.

684
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,120
You want to check out
 our team, right?

685
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,320
Come on, I know Mr. Oh's 
style, why should I?

686
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,490
Yes.

687
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,260
I'll be right back.

688
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,700
Are you kidding me?

689
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,570
-Excuse me?
-You think work is a joke?

690
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,030
Am I your friend?

691
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,430
No.

692
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,640
You should be tense around 
a new person.

693
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,140
Yes.

694
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,910
Leave our tough, but fun 
memories of three years ago behind.

695
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,800
Don't take them with you 
forever, it's pathetic.

696
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,980
What?

697
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,980
Yes.

698
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,590
Uh, Mr. Chun.

699
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,840
You didn't come to our team

700
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,920
for other reasons, did you?

701
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,460
Not me, at least.

702
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,220
Though I don't know what 
the sender was thinking.

703
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,560
I'm sure no one's criticizing 
your team,

704
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,120
but you should know 
 they're watching.

705
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,140
They're staring.

706
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,640
If you suspect me, it won't be 
good, so perish the thought.

707
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:53,670
You guys didn’t do anything wrong.
You did well.

708
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,640
But having people like that 
around is suffocating.

709
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,550
Nothing's happened yet, but if

710
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,250
they need me, they'll call me out.

711
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,320
Anyway get used to
 the circumstances.

712
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,420
Why…

713
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,840
…did they send you?

714
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,730
I'm going nuts.

715
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,760
What?

716
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,580
It's because we're close.

717
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,220
If they send someone who's not close,

718
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,740
who knows what your filtering will do?

719
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,980
Let's make it work out.

720
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,600
Hello, sir.

721
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,820
Oh, hi.

722
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,660
Let's look at the work 
progress, Mr. Kim.

723
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,760
Yes, I'll send it right away.

724
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,730
Who was in charge of this?

725
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,380
Our team, sir.

726
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,150
This is the Jordan case.
The one where Mr. Park got in trouble.

727
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,040
Oh, there are reasons…

728
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,890
Let's see the documents 
again in the afternoon.

729
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,660
-This won't do.
-Oh…

730
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,990
-Sir.
-Mr. Chun!

731
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,330
Yes?

732
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,480
You're funny.

733
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,910
Work since you're at work.

734
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,330
Don't influence others that way.

735
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:43,480
You know why people 
get addicted to games?

736
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,780
Excuse me?

737
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,450
It's because they play games.

738
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,120
If you play games at work…

739
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,280
…you'll get addicted to games first.

740
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,740
Let's go for a drink after work.

741
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,650
What is this?

742
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,560
Yesterday's receipt for the drinks.

743
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,300
Why, you…

744
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,840
Suk Yool.

745
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,860
I want to say something to you.

746
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,600
I was going to tell you, but I

747
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,230
didn't want to hurt your feelings.

748
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,980
What is it?

749
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,500
You have to change your 
personality for social life.

750
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,100
I won't repeat myself, 
so listen carefully.

751
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,740
Yesterday…

752
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,100
…you seemed like a sociopath.

753
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,840
Fix it.

754
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,890
Sociopath…

755
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,240
Above all, if you thought you'd

756
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,980
lead it, you would've
 taken full charge.

757
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:01,260
That way, you could
 lead the sentences.

758
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,490
Lead the sentences.

759
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,260
Lead the sentences.

760
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,980
Too long. Make it short.

761
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,180
Course…

762
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:51,460
Make this sentence connect with this…

763
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,320
Like that…

764
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:00,700
It's ready,

765
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,420
so you can dip 
it into the cheese.

766
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,840
Here's the liquor.

767
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:11,680
It was just the two drab guys and

768
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,550
now there are pretty boys with you.

769
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:15,800
Thank you.

770
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,920
Enjoy.

771
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,120
Do you still drink alone 
after work, Mr. Chun?

772
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,160
Sometimes.

773
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,000
He was famous for drinking so 
much and drinking more at home.

774
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,540
Even if you love drinking, if you 
keep drinking for other people,

775
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,020
you'll want to drink on your own too.

776
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,540
Right.

777
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,960
Since you like drinking, everyone

778
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,860
wants you to come and 
you go with the flow.

779
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,880
You start to miss drinking 
alone in your underwear.

780
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,540
Right, drinking beer in your underwear 
and watching baseball is the best.

781
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,180
My hopes aren't even that high.

782
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,650
I just want to get off work on time,

783
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,580
order fried chicken for the kids,

784
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,820
and just drink beer with them.

785
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,840
Let's toast.

786
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,430
Welcome, Mr. Chun.

787
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,100
Yes.

788
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,300
Let's enjoy our work.

789
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,200
-Like the good old days.
-Like the good old days!

790
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,340
-Yes.
-Like the good old days.

791
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,420
I'm sorry for having various

792
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,440
thoughts before joining the team.

793
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,760
I'll work hard as a team member.

794
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,820
Drink up.

795
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,130
Geu Rae.

796
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,820
Any questions or requests for me?

797
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,200
Just ask me.

798
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,980
Do I have to cut my hair?

799
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,180
What?

800
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,160
Cut it.

801
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,240
If he doesn't reply, it means cut it.

802
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,720
He told me to straighten 
my hair before.

803
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,850
Cut it.

804
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,540
You straighten yours.

805
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,300
Yeah, man.

806
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,100
You're joking, right?

807
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,260
No.

808
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,060
We should think of 
visual images too.

809
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,040
I'll start combing my hair too.

810
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,720
For our team's visual image!

811
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,160
Cheers!

812
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,820
Hey.

813
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,440
Hi.

814
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,290
I just came.

815
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,260
Are you going straight to bed?

816
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,980
What's with you?

817
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,500
You always drank when 
you came home.

818
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,730
I drank today.

819
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,800
You must like your new team.

820
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,180
You were worried about the 
personnel appointment.

821
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,320
What?

822
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,420
Yeah.

823
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,060
Hello.

824
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,960
-Hi.
-Hello.

825
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,430
Hi.

826
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,660
Mr. Oh.

827
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,460
We'll have to prepare next 
year's business proposal.

828
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,100
Yeah, you guys have time this morning?

829
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,840
-Let's have a meeting.
-Yes.

830
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,000
I didn't know Geu Rae
 would take part

831
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,200
in next year's business proposal meeting.

832
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,800
We'll be having non-stop 
meetings from today on.

833
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,240
Be ready.

834
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,580
Yes, sir.

835
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,350
-Let's go.
-Yes.

836
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,360
-Hi.
-Hi.

837
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,440
Hello.

838
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,680
-Hi.
-Hello.

839
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,860
<i>The whole company will create 
next year's business proposal</i>

840
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,420
<i>and prepare the budget, operation plans,</i>

841
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,560
<i>performance-related goals at this time.</i>

842
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,880
<i>Since a single business item is created</i>

843
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,980
<i>through many teams' cooperation,</i>

844
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,680
<i>you need to hold many meetings 
and write out numerous documents.</i>

845
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:29,220
<i>We look at new items and old proposals,</i>

846
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,320
<i>but it's not a simple job.</i>

847
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,630
Dinner delivery.

848
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:58,460
-Let's eat first.
-Let's eat.

849
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,040
Any update?

850
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,640
I thought about it and I think an

851
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,930
investment business 
will be a good idea.

852
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:20,900
<i>Sales Team 3 has been 
working late for days.</i>

853
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,640
I'm so tired.

854
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,180
How many days has it been?

855
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,980
My brain stopped functioning.

856
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,910
<i>You want me to tell you why 
your game isn't improving?</i>

857
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,740
You're too hung up on rules 
and previous examples.

858
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,500
Obviously you should

859
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,420
learn and study moves,

860
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,820
but how can the game survived

861
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,920
only through unchanging truths?

862
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,860
Then what should I do?

863
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,480
Break the formality.

864
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,100
Be radical.

865
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,940
Radical?

866
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,620
<i>If you don’t break the formality,</i>

867
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,500
<i>you can't become a pro.</i>

868
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,660
What do you think of 
the Jordan business?

869
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,820
What?

870
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,250
Geu Rae.

871
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,380
What did you just say?

872
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,830
Redoing the Jordan business.

873
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,690
You mean Mr. Park's…

874
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,580
by the Jordan business?

875
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,830
Yes.

876
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,880
What are you saying?

877
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,980
I guess you don’t know as a newbie,

878
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,840
but you shouldn't take 
others' businesses.

879
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,720
Don’t even bring up Jordan.

880
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,460
For the time being.

881
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,680
If you exclude the corruption,

882
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,920
I think it's a good business item.

883
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,560
<i>The meeting froze at a fast pace.</i>

884
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,580
Why do they look so serious?

885
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,370
Hello.

886
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,720
What's with Geu Rae's expression?

887
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,860
Getting told off big time…

888
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,120
Why'd you get told off?

889
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,800
I wasn't.

890
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,100
Weren't you?

891
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,340
Mr. Kang.

892
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,860
Good.

893
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,700
Hold on.

894
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,880
<i>Big news about Geu Rae.</i>

895
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,800
What, what?

896
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,870
I asked a hundred times.

897
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:39,560
How could Geu Rae think of that?

898
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,540
He just doesn’t get it.

899
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,880
Doesn't he know what the company 
thinks of Sales Team 3?

900
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,320
They think of them as informants.

901
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,120
No one's comfortable.

902
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,820
He likes adventures.

903
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,320
Adventures?

904
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,160
He seems so at times 
though I don't know why.

905
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,400
You fell for him?

906
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,320
What?

907
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,800
Young Yi.
You're overestimating him…

908
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,560
-Are you jealous?
-What?

909
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,300
What's wrong with him?

910
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,080
-What?
-I'm going to criticize everyone.

911
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,300
Got a problem?

912
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,620
I'll have a twisted 
attitude from now on.

913
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:19,240
Anyway, Mr. Oh isn't 
going to approve.

914
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,980
He shouldn't.

915
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:43,560
Come over.

916
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,760
<i>Our team's meeting came to a stop.</i>

917
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,610
<i>We can assume the anticipated 
debates and misunderstandings,</i>

918
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,380
<i>and unexpected damages.</i>

919
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:01,780
<i>But no one could easily reject</i>

920
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,550
<i>the newbie's radical idea.</i>

921
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,890
<i>Even if I'm merely a newbie,</i>

922
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,780
<i>they need a just reason 
to reject my idea.</i>

923
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,630
<i>That's what a team is.</i>

924
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:14,400
<i>But this proposal was…</i>

925
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:17,800
<i>…a bit unique.</i>

926
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,680
<i>Do you not want it?</i>

927
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,680
<i>Is it just bound to fail?</i>

928
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,220
<i>Is it something we shouldn't do?</i>

929
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,300
<i>Or is it something we 
can do nevertheless?</i>

930
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,980
<i>It's something you shouldn't 
do nevertheless.</i>

931
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:37,780
Everyone knows there's 
leftover business.

932
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:41,060
But no one's saying they'll do it.

933
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,800
They don’t want the misunderstanding 
of getting credit

934
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,030
from a different team's work.

935
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,500
Yes.

936
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,320
Even teams that have 
nothing to do with it.

937
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,960
But your team…

938
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,120
that was involved in it 
wants to do it.

939
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,860
Right.

940
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,260
Are you crazy?

941
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,280
That's wrong.

942
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,520
Then you guys do it.

943
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,020
What?

944
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,800
How did the newbie's 
words influence you?

945
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,840
Then should I abandon it?

946
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,940
Yeah.

947
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,300
You should.

948
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,080
There are lots to do aside from that.

949
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,980
Can I do it if there aren't?

950
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,540
Are you playing games with me?

951
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:21,800
Don’t do it.
You have a weak cause.

952
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,530
Yes, it's a weak cause.

953
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,540
If you must do it,

954
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,760
you need a just reason.

955
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,470
A higher value than the fact that

956
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,560
it will bring in high profits.

957
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:37,800
I need a just reason?

958
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,910
Yep.

959
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,580
Geu Rae.

960
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,580
Yes.

961
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,300
Let me ask you a question.

962
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,740
Are you going for the 
profits of the Jordan case?

963
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,200
Is that why you don't 
want to miss it?

964
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,440
That's not all.

965
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,110
Though I do think it 
was a good business.

966
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,030
Then why must you take 
over this business?

967
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,580
I don't think our team's 
work is done there.

968
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,950
It's not done?

969
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,340
I think we were insulted.

970
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:27,930
Insulted?

971
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,700
Our company was 
insulted by Mr. Park.

972
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:39,160
I don't know if just 
reporting him was enough…

973
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,840
You don't think it was enough?

974
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,740
I think we should wrap it up.

975
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,420
Wrap it up?

976
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:53,200
We should utilize the 
company's manuals and

977
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,790
systems to make the biggest profit.

978
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:58,160
We must make the business 
back to what it was.

979
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,320
We were insulted?

980
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:14,340
Our company was
 insulted by Mr. Park?

981
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,940
If we eliminate the corruption…

982
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:27,580
Yes, it's a good business.

983
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,550
Since you're a newbie…

984
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,940
Only a trading company's 
newbie could think of it.

985
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,800
That's a trading man, alright.

986
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,930
Ok.

987
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,540
Let's do this business.

988
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,440
Let's do it.

989
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:27,410
[Misaeng]

990
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,060
Why'd you send me to Sales Team 3?

991
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,060
You still don't get it?

992
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,510
Hey, you wanted to do it!

993
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,480
What happened to Mr. Oh?

994
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,780
Take it as work.

995
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,090
I'm not ready yet.

996
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,900
-Aren't I better-looking?
-What?

997
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,260
He's like a daredevil.

998
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,480
It's like Mr. Choi's cause.

999
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,830
When were we too scared 
to do daring things?
