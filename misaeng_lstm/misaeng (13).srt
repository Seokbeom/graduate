- How about the Jordan business?

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,680
I think it's a good item if 
you set aside the corruption.

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,300
How could Geu Rae think of that?

Don't they know how the 
employees view the team?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,860
I think the whole company was insulted.

Ok.

Are you capable of 
supporting this project?

We set it up and we're not doing it.

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,130
Don't you know ethics 
or have a conscience?

What?

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,640
There will be a company 
briefing for your proposal.

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,760
It's not convincing.

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,800
I think PT shows how it could 
be bad for our business.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
What do you mean?

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,740
When you look at a map?

21
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,540
I would say thinking 
north goes up is a habit.

22
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,380
Starting with the outline 
is a precedent?

23
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,550
but if you're thinking 
of changing the content,

24
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,720
I'm against it.

25
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,590
We only think within the structure, 
but he didn't think about the limit.

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,920
This is absurd.

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,000
But if this doesn?t work out, I think

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,660
I'll be really mad at you, Geu Rae.

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,050
you can see they have 
a tiny domestic market.

182
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,990
It's in the Middle East,

183
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,390
but they lack resources including oil.

184
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,970
But thanks to a stable 
political state and

185
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,090
their location in the 
center of the Middle East,

186
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,710
intermediary trade is developed.

187
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,910
We have about 280,000 
exportable used cars.

188
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,150
90,000 are going to Jordan.

189
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,330
This is a large amount compared 
to Jordan's population.

190
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,390
Because they're re-exported
 to Iraq, Saudi Arabia,

191
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,020
Syria and spread to the Middle East.

192
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,160
We'll connect with the branch manager

193
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,200
in Amman, Jordan for current info.

194
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,370
Hello, sir and executives.

195
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,290
Jordan has shown a very positive 
response regarding the business.

196
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,510
Having met a few companies,

197
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,170
I know they have been 
extremely positive about it.

198
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,880
They have stated they want to do 
business together proactively.

199
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,230
You can see the lists on page 18?

200
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,680
As the presentation went on,

201
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,210
Mr. Kim's conviction was

202
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,270
conveyed to the executives.

203
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,830
Regarding the contract and I'm 
sure it will be a secure business.

204
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,650
That's it for our team's Jordan used

205
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,330
car export business presentation.

206
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,540
Thank you.

207
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,330
It's not bad.

208
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,030
Yes.

209
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,290
It mustn't have been easy 
to take over the subordinate's job

210
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,870
who was punished because of you.

211
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,670
So we tried to focus on the 
true value of the business.

212
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,570
It's a well-prepared report.

213
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,770
Were you able to handle it all?

214
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,170
Yes, the Jordan team helped greatly.

215
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,010
I heard the youngest member in your

216
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,770
team proposed redoing this item.

217
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,830
Yes, the new employee, 
Jang Geu Rae.

218
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,370
His name is Geu Rae?

219
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,710
Jang Geu Rae?

220
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,410
I'm not sure who?

221
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,550
Where is he?

222
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,090
Hello.

223
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,430
Hello.

224
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,710
It's him.

225
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,420
You're a daredevil.

226
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,190
Geu Rae?

227
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,190
[Geu Rae: "Yes" is Korean]

228
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,190
Yes.

229
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,330
Why did you think of this proposal?

230
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,990
That's? that's?

231
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,650
?that's? because it's our company.

232
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,090
Our company?

233
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,090
Our company?

234
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,530
Our company?

235
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,870
Yes, our company.

236
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,780
Yes, it's our company, of course.

237
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:25,070
It's obvious but somehow
 we feel shameful.

238
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,620
I know.

239
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,760
Yes, thank you.

240
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,170
Thank you.

241
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,270
I hope you can succeed with the

242
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,890
Jordan used car export business.

243
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,170
Thank you.

244
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,460
Good job.

245
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,050
Thank you.

246
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,670
Mr. Lee, shall we postpone 
today's golf to another day?

247
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,650
I want to stay at our 
company for a while.

248
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,350
Yeah.

249
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,010
This was totally out of 
the box for a trading man.

250
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,290
Didn't you do something daring

251
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,970
like that 20 years ago too, Mr. Lee?

252
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,530
Yes, I did, many times.

253
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,680
Good job.

254
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,920
Thank you.

Get up, you little fool.

258
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,970
Yes, thank you for your help.

259
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,490
No, you guys did it.

260
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,470
I need to go to Abu Dabi soon.

261
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,330
What will you do about the 
contract and schedule?

262
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,570
I'll let you know after 
things are discussed.

263
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,710
Yes.

264
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,930
I appreciate it.

265
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,010
Thank you.

Mr. Chun.

267

Yes.

268
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,530
Thanks for hanging in there 
when it must have been stressful.

269
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,580
You've been a great help.

270
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,650
It's been?great for me too.

271
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,090
Should I send an appreciation mail to 
those who were at the presentation?

272
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,490
I'll do it.

273
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,690
You send messages to the concerned 
depts. and get confirmation.

274
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,630
Sure.

275
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,070
Where's Geu Rae?

276
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,190
He's still acting like a naive fool,

277
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,190
so I told him to get some fresh air.

278
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,480
Come on, here is Geu Rae.

279
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,990
Tell them.

280
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,350
There's nothing to say.

281
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,050
See, you're all arrogant now.

282
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,150
So you're the first to have 
a meeting with the CEO, huh?

283
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,150
Come on.

284
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,690
You started to be arrogant 
the moment Mr. Oh accepted your idea.

285
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,390
Congratulations.

286
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,590
I didn't think you'd 
pull it off this well.

287

Thank you.

288
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,250
That makes me feel weird.

289
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,920
It makes me want to do well 
so I don't end up like that.

290

Congratulations.

I'll get going.

295
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,270

Come here.

300
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,470
Aren't you being too greedy?

301
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,090
Are you jealous of someone 
struggling from the bottom up

302
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,370
when you have great specifications?

303
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,690
What?

304
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,150
Don't be that way.

305
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,670
Actually their team's 
incident isn't normal.

306
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,910
They're trying to resolve 
existing issues.

307
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,770
I think working on it so there are no

308
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,710
problems to begin with would be better.

309
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,950
Maybe it's some kind of deception.

310
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,420
Right.

311
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,670
Deception.

312
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,260

364
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,010
Maybe people trust that promise 
and prepare, plan and execute.

365
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,130
I hope the people who believe that 
promise aren't made fools of.

366
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,910
He really doesn't get it.

367
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,830
Doesn't he know how the 
employees view the team?

368
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,990
Baek Ki.

369
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,670
Mr. Cha hates tardiness
the most.

370
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,890
You must be in a good mood.

371
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,430
A first attack, just the thought

372
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,250
of it makes me feel great.

373
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,530
If it's right, it's right, and 
if it's wrong, it's wrong.

374
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,710
I have a resignation letter in here.

375
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,530
Hi, Baek Ki.

376
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,050
Suk Yool.

377
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,310
It's me.

378
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,220
I have a favor to ask.

379
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,510
What?

380
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,470
Hello, is this really Baek Ki?

381
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,910
Hurry up.

382
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,710
I can't believe you're 
asking me a favor.

383
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,710
Ok.

384
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,030
I like you like this the best so far.

385
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,940
Ok, mm-hmm.

386
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,700
Bye.

387
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,330
What was that?

388
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,750
A secret.

389
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,770
I shouldn't cramp Baek Ki's style.

390
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,180
Cheers.

391
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,390
Hello.

392
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,660
Hold on!

393
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,050
Get in, Baek Ki, I came here for you.

394
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,310
You're 10 minutes late.

395
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,990
The favor?

396
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,780
Thank you.

397
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,170
Take it off.

398
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,230
What?

399
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,470
You can't go in like that.

400
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,470
Take it off and come for it later.

401
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,930
You should ask your 
training boss for help.

402
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,690
Can't he do this for you?

403
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,750
It's too awkward for me.

404
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,290
Awkward?

405
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,110
Then I guess you can't share 
your concerns with him.

406
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,590
You're right.

407
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,840
That's cold.

408
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:49,170
Although the psychopath 
isn't a good senior either.

409
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,120
- Did you go to a sauna together?
- What?

410
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,210
Then it wouldn't be awkward.

411
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,330
Don't ever go to one 
before you become close.

412
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,090
Why not?

413
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,170
You'll die of the awkwardness.

414
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,890
See, imagine you're in a tub together.

415
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,770
You can't get out first, but your 
skin bloats just sitting there.

416
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,610
Even when you scrub yourself.

417
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,500
It's weird sitting side by side.

418
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,900
But it's weird? sitting 
apart like strangers.

419
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,730
You can't do this or that, and you

420
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,550
can't tell him he has 
soap suds on him.

421
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,810
Why can't you?

422
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,450
Then he'll think you were 
staring at his naked body.

423
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,530
What?

424
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,790
"What?"

425
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,750
A perfect crime.

426
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,390
You're late.

427
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,530
Uh, yes.

428
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,870
Get your clothes, Suk Yool.

429
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,200
Yes.

430
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,450
I told you many times, the worst

431
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,810
thing for employees is tardiness.

432
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,350
Geez.

433
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,570
It's because you're not good 
with self-management, Baek Ki.

434
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,210
Yes, I'm sorry.

435
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:19,170
We'll have to postpone the 6:00 meeting

436
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,110
30 minutes, I'll be there at 6:30.

437
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,650
Why still here? Go.

438
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,550
Finance is checking the budget and

439
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,130
there will be a meeting 
with the Legal Team.

440
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,950
Other meetings are set too.

441
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,390
How about if you participate too?

442
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,550
Sure, and be a bit softer since

443
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,960
opinions aren't all positive yet.

444
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,010
Yes.

445
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,250
Mr. Chun.

446
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,850
This is Mr. Lee Jin Tae and he'll take 
care of sales regarding the case.

447
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,430
- Hello.
- Hello.

448
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,100
You know Mr. Chun, right?

449
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,150
Glad to work with you again.

450
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,500
Yeah.

451
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,430
This is Mr. Kim Dong Sik.

452
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,340
Hello.

453
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,730
Your build looks like the dept. head.

454
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,810
Thank you.

455
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,330
This is Jang Geu Rae.

456
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,870
I'm Jang Geu Rae.

457
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,330
I know.

458
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,030
Did your team's position 
become stable by this?

459
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,030
I'm sorry?

460
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,260
Sir!

461
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,330
Hello, sir!

462
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,700
Mr. Ko, long time no see.

463
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,000
-Hello.
- Hi...

464
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,670
Would you like some coffee?

465
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,050
Get some coffee.

466
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,090
Sit down.

467
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,130
Hello.

468
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,150
Young Yi.

469
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,030
Coffee errand?

470
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,110
Yes.

471
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,710
I came to make coffee for everyone 
including the new head of the dept.

472
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,910
Then I'll treat you 
to your team's coffee.

473
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,050
What?

474
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,390
I didn't congratulate 
Mr. Oh on his promotion.

475
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,210
So I'll do that with coffee.

476
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,300
Tell them it's coffee made by Young Yi.

477
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,890
Americano?

478
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,490
Your team will have
a warm end of the year.

479
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,270
You're right.

480
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,790
Time has flown.

481
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,240
You were so busy working, 
you didn't realize that?

482
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:50,250
Maybe Mr. Oh will get promoted again.

483
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,710
Sir.

484
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,590
Would you like some coffee?

485
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,370
Young Yi, get ready for the meeting?

486
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,530
Sir.

487
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,370
Meeting?

488
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,610
Why should she get ready for it?

489
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,070
Yes.

490
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,310
She'll take charge of the Norway case.

491
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,310
There will be a short briefing.

492
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,890
You don?t want it?

493
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,590
Make a separate briefing on your own.

494
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,530
I don't want make-up smell 
in the meeting room.

495
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:04,920
Young Yi.

496
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,650
I think I really get 
tougher with time.

497
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,450
I don't feel hurt at all.

498
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,330
It's quite interesting now.

499
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,950
I'll get going.

500
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,390
Make sure to tell them 
I made the coffee.

501
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,730
What is this?

502
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,870
Why do I have to get in
 trouble for this?

503
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,780
Suk Yool.

504
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,830
- Yes?
- You did this, didn't you?

505
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,950
No, sir?

506
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,690
It's by fault, I'll explain 
so he understands.

507
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,110
No, he?

508
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:51,060
I told you to delete the account 
data since it's hard to show it now!

509
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,730
How strong can he possibly be?

510
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,530
There's a secret to real fighting.

511
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,470
You need to attack first.

512
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,650
You gave it to me and told me to 
organize it according to order.

513
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,880
When did I do that?

514
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:11,710
Gosh, what are you doing here?

515
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,710
Geez.

516
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,770
Then why would I have found the 
lost data and put it in there?

517
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,330
Will you continue talking back to me?

518
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,370
It's true, why should I get in 
trouble for what I didn't do?

519
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,590
A team is in it together!

520
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,970
You get told off together and 
take responsibility together!

521
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,170
Then why do you always get out?

522
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,270
What?

523
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:36,230
Please take responsibility 
for your work.

524
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,870
Let's make it a real team.

525
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,510
Wow, look at you.

526
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,510
Responsibility?

527
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,330
You want to see?

528
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,120
what real responsibility is?

529
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,970
Geu Rae, this is the Jordan data, and

530
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,970
you remember the trade 
insurance corp.?

531
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:06,700
Yes.

532
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,800
- Resend it to them.
- Yes.

533
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,850
But do we need to resend it 
though we already applied?

534
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,230
That was for our loss and other

535
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,590
companies could suffer damage too.

536
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,410
- Send it soon.
- Sure.

537
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,190
Hello.

538
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,750
- There's a meeting with Chemicals, right?
- Yes, let's go in.

539
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,460
Yes.

540
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,460
We're about to go in.

541
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,870
What?

542
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,250
Geu Rae too?

543
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,890
Sure.

544
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,430
They want you to come too.

545
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,550
What?

546
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,670
Why when he's not even involved?

547
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,210
You're so popular!

548
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,750
Are you like a celeb?

549
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,520
Gosh.

550
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,830
Hi, Young Yi!

551
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,830
Oh, make coffee only 
for me from now on.

552
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,350
Sure.

553
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,350
You have many meetings these days.

554
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,210
Yes.

555
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,790
Why do they keep asking for him
 who doesn't know anything?

556
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,610
Dang people.

557
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,930
But he's good at taking 
notes and recordings.

558
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,550
His meeting minutes are 
perfect, you know.

559
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,480
Ha, geez!

560
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,970
- I'll get going.
- Get in!

561
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,290
Bye.

562
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,320
Young Yi, come here.

563
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,530
Hey.

564
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,930
Wear flat shoes.

565
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,700
You annoy people!

566
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,230
Answer me.

567
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,040
Yes, sir.

568
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,710
I heard you did this document.

569
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,510
Hey!

570
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,990
You drive me crazy.

571
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,890
Looking at your document, I nearly

572
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,220
jumped off the plane coming back!

573
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,550
Resident employees 
struggle because of this!

574
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,460
Have you made calls with 
our people when doing this?

575
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,890
Did you?

576
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,730
I had asked my boss since 
I'm not familiar with them.

577
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,030
What?

578
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,510
You asked your boss?

579
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,030
Look at you.

580
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,850
Hey, is he your secretary?

581
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,830
Sir, I said I'd call them 
since I know them?

582
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,570
Is it a blind date or what?

583
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,850
What more do you need besides 
name and position when working?

584
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,750
Are you all crazy?

585
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,250
You think think is a game?

586
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,830
Please tell us what the problem is...

587
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,830
How far do you think the Norway 
resources project has proceeded?

588
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,530
As far as I know, it just 
has to be approved?

589
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,770
Right, it just has to be approved.

590
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,810
But why isn't it being approved?

591
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:05,390
The additional business you guys 
sent messed up the schedule!

592
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,870
Just wait when you have to even 
if you have nothing to do.

593
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:13,070
The local team struggles because 
you guys pretend to work.

594
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,450
Do you know what you're doing?

595
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,230
A business game.

596
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,520
A business game!

597
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,350
Dang.

598
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,950
Gosh, I thought things 
were going great for her.

599
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:51,530
They say things don't 
work that easy.

600
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,530
Let's work.

601
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,470
Are you ok?

602
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,730
He's too much.

603
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,090
Drink it.

604
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,590
It'll calm you down.

605
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,410
We're not in the position 
to be comforting anyone.

606
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,770
So there's nothing to say.

607
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,130
Except him.

608
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,150
Try it.

609
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,410
Just suck it.

610
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,670
Like this.

611
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,380
Hello.

612
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

613
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,290
Geu Rae.

614
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,950
Your team was in charge 
of the Iran case, right?

615
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:04,970
Yes.

616
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:09,330
We're thinking of doing an item in Iran.

617
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,330
How was it?

618
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,110
You think Iran's circumstances 
will improve?

619
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,110
What?

620
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,970
I'm not asking for 
a professional analysis.

621
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,470
I'm curious what your
 next move would be.

622
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:25,130
I don't know.

623
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,010
Come on, why ask him 
that out of the blue?

624
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,380
Let's have coffee later.

625
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,420
My gosh.

626
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,370
I have to organize some 
storage samples.

627
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,490
I'll get going.

628
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,730
Indeed, there is no direct
 correlation

629
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,230
between your school grades 
and happiness.

630
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,010
My gosh.

631
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,330
I'm not asking for 
a professional analysis.

632
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:15,750
I'm curious what your
 next move would be.

633
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,610
Are you done?

634
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,410
Yes, I just need to finish this.

635
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,180
Can I leave now?

636
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,770
Mr. Kang got off, so you can leave

637
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,670
as soon as you're done here.

638
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,910
Yes, sir.

639
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,010
Go relax at a sauna.

640
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,390
- Oh?
- You worked hard.

641
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,890
Thank you.

642
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,890
- Bye.
- Bye.

643
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,020
Aren't you being too greedy?

644
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,760
Are you jealous of someone 
struggling from the bottom up

645
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,830
when you have great specifications?

646
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,730
We just have to reach it.

647
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:37,440
I'm like this because 
I don't think I can make it.

648
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,070
It's just me who's at
 the same point.

649
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:58,770
Don't ever go to one 
before you become close.

650
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:02,350
Then it wouldn't be awkward.

651
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,900
You'll die of the awkwardness.

652
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,210
See, imagine you're in a tub together.

653
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,530
You can't get out first, but your

654
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,150
skin bloats just sitting there.

655
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,490
Is it hot?

656
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,030
No, sir.

657
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,550
Even when you scrub yourself.

658
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,610
It's weird sitting side by side.

659
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,950
But it's weird? sitting 
apart like strangers.

660
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,490
You can't do this or that.

661
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,490
I'll get going.

662
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,490
Oh, bye.

663
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:29,550
And you can't tell him 
he has soap suds on him.

664
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,780
Why can't you?

665
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,770
Then he'll think you were 
staring at his naked body.

666
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:23,610
I never thought I'd see you here.

667
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,510
I usually wrap up the week here.

668
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,610
I got all dusty after 
storage organization.

669
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,450
Ok.

670
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,030
I'll get going.

671
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,750
I'll see you on Monday.

672
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,910
Mr. Kang.

673
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,430
Let's go for a drink.

674
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,260
Are you saying you're 
not motivated for work?

675
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,600
My colleagues seem to 
be accomplishing things,

676
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,660
but I think I'm right where I started.

677
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:15,460
And that? makes me 
think I'm lagging behind.

678
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,080
You won't suddenly feel 
like submitting a proposal.

679
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,280
It's not that.

680
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,180
Are you jealous of Geu Rae?

681
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,000
I'm not jealous.

682
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,100
But?

683
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,940
I feel mad at myself.

684
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,100
Especially since you're not 
a temporary worker like him.

685
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,880
You work for Steel, right?

686
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,080
Didn't I tell you before?

687
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,340
The jobs for Steel are fixed 
within the categories.

688
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,000
You need to check and manage 
for smooth operation.

689
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,320
You think fixed businesses 
have no work?

690
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,270
No, sir.

691
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,150
You know our team's yearly profits?

692
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,120
How much work the required 
manpower and related countries?

693
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,040
A lot to do to ensure things to go 
smoothly after signing the contract.

694
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,080
Does that all seem meaningless to you?

695
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,820
No, sir.

696
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,660
It doesn?t matter how 
it looks to others.

697
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,860
It's not flashy but doing necessary
 work is what's important.

698
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,240
We might not see it?

699
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,220
?but don't think it doesn't exist.

700
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,720
The figures we decide on?

701
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,680
are a big deal to others.

702
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,440
You should motivate yourself, Baek Ki.

703
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,580
It'll be tough to survive 
if you can't do that.

704
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,130
Yes.

705
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,040
Geu Rae.

706
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,760
Yo, yo, yo.

707
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,760
The bright season for 
company employees.

708
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,940
A service for those working for 
salary like us, Christmas tree?

709
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,120
The company does care for us,
 mm-hmm.

710
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,040
Any year-end plans?

711
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,180
What will you do, Young Yi?

712
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,220
I'll go drink.

713
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,840
Tough girl.

714
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,080
Baek Ki?

715
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,020
I got season tickets for a ski resort.

716
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,120
Awesome, you must really 
not have a girlfriend.

717
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,500
And you?

718
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,760
I don't have one either.

719
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,400
-What?
- A girlfriend.

720
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,820
Ok.

721
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,780
You use Twitter?

722
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,520
No, not really?

723
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,230
Someone wants to 
follow you, open that.

724
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,640
[Ha Jung Yeon]

725
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,680
Who is it?

726
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,040
- Stop it.
- You said you have no girlfriend.

727
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,880
- I don't.
- Who is it?

728
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,620
I don't know.

729
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,960
It's Ms. Ha.

730
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,160
Ms. Ha?

731
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,960
Who's that?

732
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,730
Who's Ms. Ha?

733
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:03,730
So Mi's daycare center teacher.

734
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,730
So Mi who?

735
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,400
Daycare center teacher?

736
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,960
Yes.

737
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,780
How'd she find out my ID?

738
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,780
We can ask her.

739
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,380
Come on, give it back.

740
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,140
How did you find out my Twitter ID?

741
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:21,580
I always searched for it,
 it took a while to find it.

742
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:22,740
Why?

743
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,140
You think this is a joke?

744
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,020
If you want to know,
 treat me to a drink.

745
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,440
She's proactive.

746
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,740
Geez.

747
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,620
Why should I treat you to a drink?

748
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,870
Geu Rae, go for it.

749
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,000
-Hello.
- Hello.

750
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,000
Hello.

751
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,320
-Hello.
- Hello.

752
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,020
Hello.

753
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,220
Hello.

754
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,200
Hello!

755
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,360
I'm sorry for being late!

756
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,320
You replaced the cartridge.

757
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,010
I was going to do it today.

758
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,420
Mr. Kim.

759
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,520
Yeah.

760
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,100
Ok, it's neat, perfect, 
and professional.

761
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,930
Good job, Mr. Kim.

762
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,620
Good job.

763
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,900
Geu Rae.

764
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,740
Shall we have coffee?

765
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,500
Sure!

766
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,640
Water too.

767
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,200
He reacts faster now.

768
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,160
I think it's old maid hysteria.

769
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,960
She only treats me that way.

770
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,820
What can we do?
Just put up with it.

771
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,460
She went nuts today.

772
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,620
Hello.

773
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

774
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,560
I'm going crazy.

775
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,760
What happened with the resume?

776
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,620
You have wheels on your feet?

777
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,960
Be quiet.

778
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,180
So what?

779
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,280
He's a temp in Sales Team 3.

780
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,150
They'll hear you.

781
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:33,050
He'll start sending out resumes 
after his contract is over too.

782
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,540
Stop it!

783
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,880
- Oh, dear.
- It'll get cold!

784
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,360
Yes.

785
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,640
Come on.

786
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,860
- Yes.
- Don't do mine.

787
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,980
Ok.

788
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,300
I almost cried.

789
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,060
I was almost disappointed.

790
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,300
I'm pathetic to have 
been about to smile.

791
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,800
He still sends out 
personal year-end cards?

792
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,840
Mr. Oh is stubborn about it.

793
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:15,460
It's dedication for those 
who help us make a living.

794
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,740
- Give me a few.
- Yes.

795
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,320
Here.

796
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,740
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

797
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,380
Here.

798
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,050
It's the company envelope.

799
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:57,480
Write Mr. Oh Sang Sik from 
Sales Team 3 right here.

800
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,420
Yes.

801
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,260
Thanks to them, my first 
kid is going to school.

802
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:06,330
My youngest gets new 
shoes and warm clothes.

803
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,580
Think you're making 
a living thanks to them.

804
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,280
Yes.

805
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,670
[Oh Sang?]

806
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,020
I'm making a living thanks to them.

807
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,720
Geu Rae.

808
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,100
Yes.

809
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,560
The first "Merry Christmas."

810
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,180
Thank you.

811
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,320
It couldn't have been better.

812
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,500
Yes!

813
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,620
Be absorbed.

814
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,720
You should always be absorbed.

815
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,500
It all depends on that.

816
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,420
That's the only issue.

817
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:46,480
In order not to feel the weight

818
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,420
of time that makes you slump over,

819
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,020
you must always be absorbed.

820
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,800
But absorbed in what?

821
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:03,380
Either alcohol, poetry or virtue.

822
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,600
That's up to you.

823
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,560
But anyway be absorbed.

824
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,820
And at times on top 
of a palace stairway,

825
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,000
or on the green meadow beside a ditch,

826
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,310
or in your depressing 
room, you wake up.

827
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:25,180
When you're not absorbed anymore,

828
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,560
ask.

829
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,260
Ask the breeze, water,

830
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,180
stars, birds, or clock.

831
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,260
Ask everything that passes by.

832
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,880
Ask everything that is sorrowful.

833
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,700
Ask everything that runs by.

834
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,700
Ask everything that sings.

835
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,400
Ask everything that talks, 
ask what time it is?

836
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,720
[It couldn't have been better, Yes!]

837
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,040
Then the breeze, water,

838
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,040
stars, birds, and clock?

839
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,720
?will answer you.

840
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:24,360
"It's time to be absorbed."

841
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,450
Sir.

842
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:49,060
[For Mr. Kang]

843
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:04,000
[It couldn't have been better, Yes!]

844
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:21,650
[Misaeng]

845
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,780
You have a girlfriend these days?

846
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,640
Thoughts on marriage?

847
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,140
Thanks for the good news.

848
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:27,960
How much is it?

849
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,720
-$50,000.
- What?

850
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,940
You look like a hard worker.

851
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,960
It was a tough job, but 
don't let that happen.

852
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,860
I can be become a full-timer 
at this rate, right?

853
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,120
I can keep working here 
at this rate, right?

854
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,000
Your names keep being mentioned.

855
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,170
Be careful with your body.

856
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:41,470
That question is not related to work.

857
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:42,300
You take this.

858
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,640
Don't hurt Geu Rae since 
that's like hurting me.

859
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,410
Didn't you say you'd 
take responsibility?

860
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,360
Will you do that to Geu Rae too?
