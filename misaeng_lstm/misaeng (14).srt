Episode 14

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,100
We had a new year's쟪ick-off쟭eeting.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,450
It was a huge scale with all 
employees participating.

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,490
There was an introduction 
and awarding for the team

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,780
with the best performance last year.

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,390
We heard about the other 
teams' performances.

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,590
Moments of embarrassment, we had

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,130
high hopes about the Jordan case.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,810
Good job.

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,190
Thank you.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,730
You realize you're just 
a small part of the whole,

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,110
not the whole itself.

16
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,190
Regarding the stainless coil

17
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,290
you asked about in December,

18
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,650
I'd recommend stainless steel grade 444.

19
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,370
You can use it for water tanks, 
feed tanks, and water heaters.

20
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,050
We'll send you a brochure, so

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,670
if you decide on the quantity,

22
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,210
we'll send you the quote.

23
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,850
We'll make it suit your needs.

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,310
Thank you.

25
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,730

Baek Ki.

27
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,350
What?

28
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,270
The "w" in German should ring

29
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,210
more than the "v" in English.

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,330
Don't bring the sound to the front 
of the nose and mouth like the "v,"

31
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,650
but make it sound like you're gagging

32
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,880
from pushing your toothbrush
 too deep in.

33
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,750
Repeat after me.

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,560
Come on.

35
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,910
That's it.

- Sir.
- Yeah?

Resource has approved the 
additional Norway business.

39
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,290
Yes.

40
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,280
Then proceed with Norway.

41
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,050
- Now help with Canada organizing.
- Yes.

42
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,470
Mr. Yoo, have you looked 
into local finances?

43
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,150
I'm still on it.

44
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,270
It'll take time to select a constructor.

45
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,960
If you're talking about solar 
energy and wind power regarding

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,900

I have a constructor list.

47
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,660
Ok.

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,830
Then you take charge of that.

49
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,270
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,990
We'll send a citron rice wine

51
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,910
sample, so please review it.

52
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,090
Yes, I think there's no plan

53
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,850
to release low-alcohol.

54
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,530
We'll check and contact you again.

55
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,390

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,650

Bye.

58
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,940
They want low-alcohol rice wine, but

59
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,870
why drink it unless 
you want to get drunk?

60
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,880
In Japan, they like mixing soda in

61
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,470
whiskey and juice in vodka nowadays.

62
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,150
I think the trends are changing to 
low-alcohol and beer-flavored drinks.

64
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,550

dropped, you got to save me.

69
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,730
You haven't received tutoring.

70
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,510
You haven't received...tutoring.

71
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,110

Come on, I'm so busy, there's 
no time to get married.

75
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,990
Is that why you called?

76
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,910
Is she pretty?

77
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,530

Gosh, this is urgent.

89
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,990
I'm working on last year's accounts.

90
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,430
A few of your team's data is missing.

91
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,440
I need the purchased 
amount of nuclear energy

92
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,430
for the T/F case with our 
team in the 2nd quarter.

93
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,110
Can you find it?

94
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,710
Yes.

95
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,890
Here it is.

96
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,290
Would you like a copy?

97
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,910
This is it.

98
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,230
Yes.

99

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,470
Uh, I heard a newbie thought 
up the Jordan business.

101
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,810
Is it you?

102
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,150
Yes.

103
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,650
Yeah?

104
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,030
You look like a smart worker.

105
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,230
Thank you.

106
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,010
Mr. Ham, hello.

107
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,290
Hi, Mr. Kim.

108
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,010
I came to your team for something 
and he took care of it.

109
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,440
Yeah?

110
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,140
- See you around.
- Bye.

-Geu Rae.
-Yes?

112
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,110
He didn't say anything much?

113
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,890
No, he just talked about work.

114
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,430
No way.

115
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,710
He used to be in Planning.

116
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,310
I'm sure he's really upset now.

117
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,370
He applied for more employees 
since his team needs more.

118
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,150
Anyway Geu Rae,

119
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,410
rumors about you have
 spread and people

120
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,690
will look for you for various reasons.

121
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,790
Someone like me?

122
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,710
They'll want the newbie 
 the CEO complimented.

123
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,310
And they'll think there are no 
worries even when you become useless.

124
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,190
I'll do the coffee.

125
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,420
Here.

126
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,130
Thanks.

127
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,590
Go ahead.

128
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,870
They'll want the newbie 
 the CEO complimented.

129
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,010
And they'll think there are no 
worries even when you become useless.

130
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,770
Since I'm a temp.

131
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,230
Geu Rae.

132
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,600
Yes.

133
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,960
Did Mr. Ham just come by?

134
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,970
Yes.

135
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,770
Don't share files when the 
person in charge is away!

136
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,330
You shouldn't do things you 
can't take responsibility for!

137
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,770
Yes, sir.

138
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,450
Dang.

139
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,620
How dare he come to my team and?

140
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,890
I'm back.

141
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,870
Something happened?

142
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,850
Oh?

143
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,850
Mr. Ham came to feel Geu Rae out.

144
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,730
They need more employees.

145
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,110
That's rude to think of stealing 
our people in the new year.

146
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,390
Yes, you'll have to wait a bit longer.

147
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,530
What?

148
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,420
We need to check the amount 
and I can't make time.

149
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,470
Yes, sir.

150
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,830
I'll send it by 5:00, I mean 5:30.

151
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,350
By fax, bye.

152
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,000
Mr. Oh.

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,670
What brings you here?

154
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,530
I got the files I needed just now.

155
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,630
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes.

156
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,910
You're really busy.

157
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,640
We need more employees.

158
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,130
You should tell upper management.

159
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,090
I can't get through to them, you know?

160
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,630
-So you're lurking around my team?
- What?

161
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,190
What are you saying?

162
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,530
No way.

163
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,590
Don't come near Geu Rae.

164
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,410
Yes.

165
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,170
It means you'll offend me.

166
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,170
Yes.

167
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,690
I'll get going.

168
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,390
Yes.

169
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,470
What happened to this employee?

170
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,910
The company didn't renew his contract.

171
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,710
What's the use of training people?

172
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,210
You have no choice if the company 
doesn't renew the contract.

173
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,790
- Here's your coffee.
- Put it there.

174
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,550
Mr. Jung!

175
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,910
Yes.

176
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,670
What happened to the Tunisia bid?

177
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,670
We lost it to Samjung, right?

178
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,730
Uh?

179
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,410
Don't you know the resource HQ

180
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,770
executive director is 
a college friend of mine?

181
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,410
I'm so embarrassed, I want to hide.

182
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,720
We didn't lose it, the Tunisia buyers?

183
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,890
Hey!

184
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,290
You're just full of excuses.

185
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,270
You just keep going on and on.

186
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,360
A trading man should just show me

187
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,730
the contract, not talk non-stop!

188
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,770
Make it work out now!

189
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,630
Geez, he gave me the info so late.

190
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,130
What am I supposed to do?

191
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,650
You know what he's like.

192
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,050
I just hate how he pokes you.

193
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,230
I wasn't even treated 
like that in school.

194
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,410
Let's have some coffee.

195
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,130
Would you like some coffee?

196
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,230
Yeah.

197
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,690
Yeah, thanks.

198
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,710
Here.

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,410
New employees, come to the 5th floor 
meeting room by 5:00, from HR.

200
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,530
Young Yi.

201
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,630
You have good news?

202
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,930
Yeah, everything's been 
ok since my attack.

203
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,190
He was acting macho-like,

204
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,330
"I'll show you responsibility,"
 but still hasn?t yet.

205
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

206
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,430
Did you meet with Ms. Ha?

207
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,750
Why should I meet with her?

208
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,190
Oh, Baek Ki, did you hit on 
any girls at the ski resort?

209
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,930
I'm not into that stuff.

210
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,010
Didn't you spend the holidays with her?

211
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,990
Young Yi.

212
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,970
You're supposed to hit 
on girls at ski resorts.

213
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,330
That's nonsense.

214
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,330
- Look!
- Look!

215
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,900
Sure.

216
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,510
You must've been out for work.

217
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,390
No, I had a visitor here.

218
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,850
Are things going smoothly 
with the Jordan case?

219
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,190
Yes, thanks to you, we're 
preparing for shipping.

220
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,370
I heard your newbie worked hard

221
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,470
regarding the Mr. Park 
and Jordan cases.

222
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,470
Yes.

223
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,170
He must be bright and full of vigor.

224
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,110
You're lucky to get such employees.

225
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,750
You had an eye for people.

226
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,920
See you later.

227
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,420
Don't be too concerned 
about the Mr. Park case.

228
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,870
That was reasonable.

229
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,730
Thank you.

230
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,230
But

231
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,710
couldn't you have told

232
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,800
me in advance about it?

233
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,670
That's not too much to ask for.

234
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,540
It's not too much.

235
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,310
That would've been nice.

236
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,460
Last year's welfare points will expire,

237
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,710
so use them all.

238
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,490
Your annual leaves too.

239
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,650
You know volunteering is reflected 
in your performance, right?

240
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,260
I like volunteering,

241
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,150
but I'll only give blood.

242
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,870
We don't count blood 
donation more than twice.

243
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,810
You'll have education 
mileages starting this year,

244
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,870
and you need to take at least 30 hours.

245
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,450
That will include English, 
trade, and data processing.

246
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,010
You need a minimum 80% attendance 
rate and test score.

247
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,010
If you don't pass, the education fee 
will be deducted from your salary.

248
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,100
English?

249
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,650
It's ok, they have easy classes and

250
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,210
don't worry since there 
are many executives.

251
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,660
Lastly, you can look at your 
contracts on annual income.

252
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,550
Your names are on the envelopes.

253
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,610
I'll get going.

254
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,620
The HR team?

255
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,410
What's with them?

256
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,230
Mr. Hong, have you finished 
your annual income contract?

257
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,690
Don't look at it.

258
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,050
Mr. Ha and Mr. Yoo, submit 
your signed contract today.

259
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

260
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,850
They set annual incomes 
and pay raises in January.

261
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,170
Of course, that doesn?t 
apply to temporary workers.

262
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,890
It's applied the moment

263
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,230
the dept. head's evaluation

264
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,360
and the team manager and 
employee's approval are complete.

265
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,830
I'm not part of the A/B/C evaluation.

266
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,490
How much is your incentive?

267
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,710
So tiny, not even $10,000.

268
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,470
You had a great performance.

269
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,530
Yeah, but what can I do if the boss?

270
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,630
I want to be one of them.

271
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,110
Dang, I work hard, but the company
 doesn't acknowledge it.

272
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,600
Why don?t we get a break?

273
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
My family wants me to get married.

274
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,800
I don't want New Year's or Thanksgiving.

275
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,230
I have another blind date this month.

276
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,870
I wonder why you get 
rejected all the time.

277
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,780
Can you research it and 
send me a Powerpoint file?

278
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,250
Look, seems feminine, right?

279
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,720
Wow, she's pretty.

280
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,370
- Seems feminine.
- Nice.

281
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,090
Who got the highest incentive?

282
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,250
After Mr. Kang, I mean.

283
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,790
It's me.

284
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,610
Geez.

285
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,530
Like them.

286
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,410
Geez.

287
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,810
- You got married?
- You can't get married this year either.

288
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,710
Geu Rae.

289
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,420
Yes.

290
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,270
The HR team presentation ended 
long ago, so where were you?

291
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,430
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,800
Where's the file 
I asked you to organize?

293
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,430
What are you doing?

294
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,010
Don't act like you 
finished something big.

295
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,550
Work like you normally do.

296
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,790
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,750
You saw in
 the Kick-Off Meeting, right?

298
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,630
What we did was 
a normal performance.

299
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,110
Of course, it was tough, 
but snap out of it.

300
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,430
Work as usual.

301
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,900
Mr. Oh.

302
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,060
What?

303
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,140
I just have to work like 
I normally do, right?

304
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,970
As usual.

305
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,740
I'll become a full-timer 
like this, right?

306
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,160
No, you won't.

307
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,700
It's what the data is about.

308
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,590
There are many college graduates 
who studied abroad.

309
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,650
They're struggling without a job too.

310
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,870
If you think of the money 
and effort they put in,

311
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,710
it might be natural 
 they get in first.

312
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,790
They want elites, so they look at

313
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,170
education, GPA scores, and talents.

314
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,860
Then they add points for 
special skills to be fair.

315
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,870
They compare everything.

316
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,940
The company's manual is very strict.

317
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,410
There won't be any room for you.

318
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,900
Mr. Oh, what are you doing?

319
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,030
Hi.

320
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,770
Let's get off early today.

321
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,770
Early?

322
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,350
I thought it was my infrastructure,

323
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,650
but it was just borrowed for a while.

324
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,000
Geu Rae?

325
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,680
What are you doing?

326
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,340
Nothing, taking off for the day?

327
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,080
Bye.

328
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,020
We got off early.

329
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,450
Shall we have a drink?

330
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,450
What?

331
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,200
It's ok.

332
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,900
Do you know

333
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,380
what I enjoyed most about work?

334
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,040
I don't know.

335
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,620
Learning how to drink.

336
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,480
I could forget

337
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,960
loneliness and tough times.

338
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,800
I could also lick the 
boots of people I hated?

339
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,570
?all thanks to alcohol.

340
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,480
But what I regret the most?

341
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,240
?is also learning how to drink.

342
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,300
I don't think I was able 
to enjoy everyday life.

343
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,520
Neither did I enjoy leisure or a break.

344
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,920
Thanks.

345
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,290
Drink slowly, sir.

346
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,760
Enjoy alcohol.

347
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,060
It could become poison.

348
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,230
Cold mind and warm heart.

349
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,660
If it's cold, raise it,

350
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,330
and if it's hot, lower it.

351
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,030
Have a cold mind
and a warm heart.

352
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,330
Alcohol can raise the heat.

353
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,560
Cold mind and warm heart.

354
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,620
That's a familiar phrase
for those who play Go.

355
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,480
Have a cold mind

356
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,190
and a warm heart.

357
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,420
As of today,

358
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,570
I'll stop drinking.

359
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,400
What?

360
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,040
Thanks to you,
 I enjoy working after a while.

361
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,480
I've felt my heart beat that 
I didn't feel for a long time

362
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,680
Don't mention it.

363
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,820
I know you went through 
a lot because of me.

364
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,760
I didn't even get to apologize,

365
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,560
because I felt so guilty.

366
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,930
Having lots of work isn't suffering.

367
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,270
I sent you to work.

368
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,740
Help them out and bring 
success to Sales Team 3.

369
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,300
Do you think I should take out

370
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,880
this cavity or treat it?

371
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,120
I just have to work like 
I normally do, right?

372
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,060
Like I normally do?

373
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,240
I'll become a full-timer 
like this, right?

374
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,360
Really?

375
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,600
Is she pretty?

376
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,940
Of course, I'll go.

377
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,460
Mr. Sung.

378
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,680
Talk to you later.

379
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,620
Yes, sir.

380
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,210
-There's a 9:30 meeting tomorrow, right?
- Yes.

381
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,650
Get the files ready so 
 I can go right in.

382
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,120
Yes, sir.

383
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,890
Suk Yool, you heard that, right?

384
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,600
Get it ready by tonight.

385
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,590
What?

386
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,700
Check if the research 
center's data is ready too.

387
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,960
Check for overseas 
news and KOTRA's data.

388
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,500
Add the credit check reports 
from the trade insurance corp.

389
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,340
Make it within 15 pages in this 
order; news, KOTRA, trade insurance,

390
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,240
research center, our report, got it?

391
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,510
Take? re? spon? 
si? bi? li? ty.

392
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,260
When will he do it on his own 
if you teach him everything?

393
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,560
Don?t overdo it.

394
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,980
Yes, but if I don't keep my eye on

395
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,420
things, accidents happen like last time.

396
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,460
Suk Yool is still a newbie, you know.

397
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,760
I'll take care of him for 
now, so please understand.

398
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,130
And I'll take off after 
I check the final file.

399
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,030
Gosh, you're so meticulous.

400
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,200
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

401
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,040
It's Oppa.

402
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,040
[Oppa: Older male or older brother]

403
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,740
Sorry, I have to work 
late and can't go tonight.

404
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,660
Sorry.

405
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,520
I'll treat you big time.

406
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,560
Ok, bye.

407
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,080
What's up?

408
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,520
You're still at work?

409
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,840
Jae Yun is treating us today.

410
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,540
Yeah, got to hurry.

411
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,240
To have a drink

412
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,460
See you where we always go.

413
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,840
Bye.

414
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,420
Text me when you're done, Suk Yool.

415
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,830
[Sung Joon Sik]

416
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,680
You can take off.

417
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,240
If I'm about to fight with a filthy dog,

418
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,500
I should be ready to get filthy.

419
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,390
[Would you like to delete 
the "meeting file"?]

420
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,430
[Yes]

421
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,100
I said there's a 9:30 meeting.

422
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,470
What time is it now?

423
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,580
I'm sorry.

424
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,880
Suk Yool.

425
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,320
You haven't made the meeting files?

426
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
Didn't you hear there's 
a meeting in the morning?

427
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,020
Oh, I made it.

428
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,490
He said he made it.

429
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,620
Why... didn't you tell me?

430
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,960
You texted me to take off.

431
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,200
You should've uploaded it.

432
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,140
I couldn't because of the 
intranet checkup time.

433
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,320
You should've printed it out!

434
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,980
The printer's broken.

435
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,780
But why isn't it in the computer?

436
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
What?
It's not there?

437
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,120
The system was so unstable yesterday, 
I guess it didn't save it.

438
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,340
What?

439
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,960
Don?t worry.

440
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,540
I have a backup file.

441
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,460
So you didn't check it yesterday?

442
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,960
Sorry, I had a sudden visitor.

443
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,820
I was away for a minute.

444
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,510
Geez.

445
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,120
Why'd a visitor come at that time?

446
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,060
Check the file and send it to me.

447
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,400
Yes, don't worry, sir.

448
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,890
This isn't right.

449
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
Suk Yool.

450
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,180
-Did you look at this?
- What?

451
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,900
What's with the spacing?

452
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,940
What would've happened if 
you had just submitted this?

453
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,700
You still don't have it down?

454
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,010
This isn't right.

455
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,380
Sir, I'll redo this ASAP.

456
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,850
Ok, and submit a written apology 
for being late, Suk Yool.

457
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,590
I'll go into the meeting.

458
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,590
Yes, see you later.

459
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,180
This isn't right.

460
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,460
Email the file to me ASAP.

461
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,470
Fights start with waiting.

462
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,380
When the opponent is strong?

463
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,040
"Strong" my foot.

464
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,800
There's a Jordan buyer 
meeting today, right?

465
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,920
Is it at the company?

466
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,260
Yes, 4:00 after a visit to the embassy.

467
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,260
At 5:00, domestic companies 
will be introduced,

468
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,160
and then we'll go for dinner.

469
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,560
Foreign Investment is 
joining tomorrow's meeting?

470
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,640
Yes.

471
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,100
- Geu Rae.
- Yes.

472
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,920
How much of the file is ready?

473
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,740
I'll finish it by this evening.

474
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,140
Mr. Chun and Mr. Kim.

475
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,040
Yes.

476
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,940
Go to the Foreign Investment 
meeting by 2:00.

477
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,880
Yes.

478
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,040
Tell them not to be 
fussy about...weird stuff.

479
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,760
Mr. Oh hasn't been in 
a good mood today.

480
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,180
Here's a picture of 
this week's blind date.

481
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,920
She's pretty.

482
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,500
I hope you get married this time.

483
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,660
Yeah.

484
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,260
My job is fine, height 
is fine, weight?

485
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,770
Maybe it's my weight?

486
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,500
Maybe it's your hair?

487
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,960
Maybe it's my voice?

488
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,610
It would be nicer low like this.

489
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,020
I'm doomed.

490
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,340
I made a reservation 
with Summerset Golf

491
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,540
for you and Samjung's Mr. Lim 
for the Netherlands case.

492
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,880
I never heard of that place.

493
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,960
You're sure it's not a lousy place?

494
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,660
You know how extravagant 
Samjung was last time.

495
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,860
It's the hottest country club now.

496
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,160
When the Thai prime minister 
came recently, they went there

497
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
with the invited employees.

498
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,180
Yeah?

499
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,920
I've prepared an environmental 
gift with a marker.

500
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,960
I chose it for its nice green image.

501
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,140
For the course?

502
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,440
It's all unnecessary, we 
just need pretty caddies.

503
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,440
That way, things will go smoothly.

504
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,020
Yes, but since important 
business will be discussed,

505
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,980
I've requested neat and calm caddies.

506
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,700
But Young Yi.

507
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,430
What's your relation 
with Samjung's Mr. Shim?

508
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,600
I went to the Korea 
Economic Association.

509
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,710
They kept mentioned you guys' names.

510
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,160
Be careful with your body so that?

511
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,860
That question is unrelated to work.

512
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,180
What?

513
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,220
Why, that?

514
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Hi,

515
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,190
coffee, sure.

516
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,130
Why, that dang?

517
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,300
Young Yi.

518
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,400
What's going on?

519
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,140
Nothing.

520
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,640
Mr. Ma?

521
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,210
It was nothing.

522
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,280
Hey!

523
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Young Yi!

524
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,040
Hey.

525
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,480
You get a kick out of 
talking back to your boss?

526
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,380
And you're giggling
 with a guy now?

527
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,580
That's why I told you to
 be careful as a woman.

528
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,900
I'm just telling you not to get

529
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,240
involved in rumors as your boss.

530
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,170
How could you talk back to me like that?

531
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,520
You think you could 
even get married like that?

532
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,640
I'm just worried since you're 
like a daughter to me!

533
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
Be careful with your body.

534
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,580
Why am I your daughter?

535
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,540
What?

536
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,760
Hey!

537
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,100
Then are you a son?

538
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,160
What a psycho!

539
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,580
What are you looking at?

540
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,320
What?

541
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,140
You want to report this 
as sexual harassment, too?

542
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,080
Why'd you jump in?

543
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,370
You should stand aside 
when a boss is talking!

544
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,140
It's because you talked back to me!

545
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,610
Hey, Mr?

546
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,720
Are you ok?

547
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,880
Shouldn't you apply some 
ointment at the medical office?

548
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,990
I'm ok.

549
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,260
I'll be right back.

550
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,980
Wipe yourself at least.

551
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,760
I'll get going.

552
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,180
I'll wash it off.

553
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,090
What are you doing?

554
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,060
You wanted to go for lunch, mister.

555
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,040
[Mr. S stands for Satan?]

556
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,800
Suk Yool?

557
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,960
[Would you like to move this to 
the "Anonymous Noticeboard"?]

558
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,830
[Yes]

559
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,100
"Strong" my foot.

560
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,080
What do you think of this kind of boss?

561
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,220
Ok.

562
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,140
Let's go eat, buddy.

563
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,520
Where's Young Yi?

564
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,460
Call her.

565
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,960
Hello.

566
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,340
Young Yi.

567
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,560
Is your neck ok?

568
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,700
Yes.

569
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,980
I'm fine.

570
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,580
Suk Yool kept looking for you.

571
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,940
I heard you were supposed 
to have lunch together.

572
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,560
Change into this.

573
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,140
It was my fault.

574
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,200
How much was it?

575
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,760
It was a bit expensive.

576
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Yes, how much was it?

577
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
- $50,000.
- What?

578
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,400
Thanks for before.

579
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,680
This is what love for 
your colleagues about.

580
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,860
No, you won't.

581
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,380
There are many college graduates

582
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,000
who studied abroad.

583
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,220
They're struggling without a job too.

584
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,920
If you think of the money 
and effort they put in,

585
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,760
it might be natural 
 they get in first.

586
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,210
The company's manual is very strict.

587
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,840
There won't be any room for you.

588
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,180
Mr. Kim.

589
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,160
It's Saturday, what are you doing?

590
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,580
I'm just home.

591
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,040
You have any plans for today?

592
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,100
No.

593
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,640
Nice, stand by.

594
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,700
What?

595
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,360
I have a blind date today.

596
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,480
I'm sure I'll get rejected again.

597
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,660
Imagine what that New Year's 
gift would feel like.

598
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,640
- That won't happen?
- What, what?

599
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,220
You said I'd get rejected 
again because of my hair.

600
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,320
That was?

601
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,080
Just stand by for an hour.

602
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,600
If I don't call you after an hour,

603
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,420
you can go and your 
bro will get married.

604
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,100
"Bro?"

605
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,340
Shall we go eat?

606
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,150
No, maybe next time.

607
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,680
Shall I set a nice date for next time?

608
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,280
No, you're not my type.

609
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm sorry.

610
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,760
What is your type?

611
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,040
I have to lose a bit of weight.

612
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,280
I'm not a dandy dresser.

613
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh, right, I should straighten my hair.

614
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,920
That's not it?

615
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,580
My voice would sound 
better low like this.

616
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,180
My colleagues teased me before.

617
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,780
Uh?

618
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,360
I don't like how you
 don't seem selfish.

619
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,350
What?

620
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,160
I think people will say you're kind,

621
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,680
but it'll be tough for your family.

622
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,460
You don't know what you're saying,

623
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,960
I'm actually very selfish
 and self-centered.

624
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,220
I was chosen as #1 selfish guy.

625
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,200
I'm sorry.

626
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,670
My dad is like that, so I

627
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,670
know how my mom suffered.

628
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,260
It's just about me, I'm sorry.

629
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,010
Uh?

630
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,540
What?

631
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,460
It wasn't my weight, hair, or voice.

632
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,280
You don't like me because 
I don't look selfishness?

633
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,220
I see selfish-less could be 
a reason to be rejected.

634
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,220
He must be doing fine.

635
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,720

already, ok.

640
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,720

642
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,620
Wow.

645
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,240

646
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,430

Men who work at conglomerates

Now, men and women
 are both cunning.

Old virtues don't work anymore now.

657
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,970
No, they don't.

658
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,840
As male chauvinism decreased, 
sacrificial minds have too.

659
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,840
Now they don't want 
girls to rely on them.

660
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,110

doesn't matter anymore.

I should take the 
express bus, not the train.

I couldn't reserve tickets 
as work was so busy.

676

I can get there by bus.

00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,610
Isn't he talking about

685
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:31,920

686

I'm Sung Joon Sik in Fabric Team 1.

689
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:50,400
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

690
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,200
It's my fault for not training 
a new employee properly.

691
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,080
You were wrong, newbie.

692
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,140
You should resolve it within the 
team even if you hate your boss.

693
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,210
He lacks the basics.

694
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,140
Who is the newbie in Fabric Team 1?

695
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,920
- Fire him.
- Many guys would want his position.

696
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,280
You want to fight?

697
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,840
How will a newbie fight?

698
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,760
Shouldn't you wait for now?

699
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,160
Fighting starts with waiting.

700
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,120
When the opponent is strong?

701
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,920
Hello.

Hello.

00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,960
Today we're getting our New Year's gift.

707
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,710
I just gave my Thanksgiving ham set

708
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,320
to Mr. Sung, I wonder why I did that.

709
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,810
I wonder why, why, why.

710
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,940

Gosh.

714
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,730
Newbies these days are useless.

They're so gutsy now.

716
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,800
He's not gutsy, he's brainless.

717
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,830
He thinks the "Anonymous" 
is really anonymous?

718
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,870
Mr. Sung is too nice.

719
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,420
He's actually indecisive.

720
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,740
If it were my team, 
I would've just? dang.

721

he'll hang in there?

Another gift when we still haven't 
finished our Thanksgiving one.

728
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,760
Gosh, it's the same 
cooking oil every year.

729
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,540
They want us to fry their ham?

730
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,400
It's ok.

731
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,700
[Cooking oil]

732
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,360
Many temps didn't get anything.

733
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,660
Let's go.

734
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,080
See you later.

735
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,380
See you later.

736
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,820
I said don't ask for too much.

737
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,140
Hello.

738
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,860
Don't ask for too much.

739
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,160
Must I get permission 
just to ask for things?

740
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,500
What?

741
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,120
It's not an issue of full-timer 
and temp positions.

742
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,640
It's not that.

743
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,910
Then?

744
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,680
It's not that.

745
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,960
I just want to continue working.

746
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,080
With our team I've worked with.

747
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,160
Us

748
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,520
together

749
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,520
always.

750
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,260
How was your blind date?

751
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,850
Well?

752
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,660
You should've done well, geez!

753
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,860
Did something happen?

754
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,830
Nothing.

755
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,300
Oh, it's ham!

756
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,180
It's not that.

757
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,540
I just want to continue working.

758
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,580
With our team I've worked with.

759
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,960
Us

760
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,800
together

761
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,880
always.

762
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,120
- Mr. Oh.
- What?

763
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,460
You did this when 
I didn't even ask you?

764
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,440
You taught me everything.

765
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,380
Not everyone gets 
what's taught to them.

766
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,380
Anyways, it's thanks to you.

767
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,460
Thank you.

768
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,740
Wow.

769
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,820
Hopefully I can continue working 
if I keep this up, right?

770
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,400
What are you doing?

771
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,840
Hey, hi, hi.

772
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

773
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:19,780
The meeting will be held early, 
so buy a gift for them.

774
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,800
Buy it during lunch since 
it's for the evening.

775
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,700
- What should I buy?
- Red ginseng, of course.

776
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,950
Bring back the receipt.

777
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,060
Yes.

778
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,160
Shall I go with you during lunch?

779
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,820
Will that be ok?

780
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,060
Yeah.

781
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,030
Geu Rae can't you even buy 
a buyer's gift on your own?

782
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,060
Uh I have to buy 
them for my team too.

783
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,360
I think this is best 
considering the price.

784
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,660
It's nice.

785
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,480
It's recommended for foreign buyers

786
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,600
since it has a strong Korean image.

787
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,760
Whose gift is Baek Ki buying?

788
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,660
I don?t know, his parents?

789
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,580
We'll get this.

790
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,040
- You can wait at the counter.
- Okay.

791
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,940
What would you like to buy?

792
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,640
Uh? something healthy

793
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,290
and easy to take.

794
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,200
All of our products are 
healthy and easy to take.

795
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,230
Let's go if you're done.

796
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,320
You're here.

797
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,180
Yes.

798
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,280
Good job.

799
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,160
Let's take off early today.

800
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,410
You're going to King's Steel, right?

801
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,880
Say hi for me.

802
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,080
Yes.

803
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,120
Come here, Geu Rae.

804
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,180
Yes.

805
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,920
Here.

806
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,230
Have a good holiday.

807
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,330
I'm good.

808
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:25,560
You should say "thank 
you" and receive it.

809
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,040
Yeah.

810
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,440
Thank you.

811
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,970
Is this the New Year's bonus?

812
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,140
They give it in envelopes 
these days too?

813
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,210
No, Mr. Oh gave it to me.

814
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,580
How gracious of him.

815
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,920
You thanked him, right?

816
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,260
Yes.

817
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,170
You should massage me harder.

818
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,540
Like a man.

819
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,980
I said don't ask for too much.

820
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,580
Don't ask for too much.

821
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,420
Must I get permission
just to ask for things?

822
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,330
What?

823
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:16,640
It's not an issue of full-timer 
and temp positions.

824
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,580
It's not that.

825
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,600
Then?

826
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,560
It's not that.

827
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,920
I just want to continue working.

828
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,080
With our team I've worked with.

829
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,600
Us

830
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,360
together

831
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,500
always.

832
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,840
Tomorrow, it will get 
loud with the guests.

833
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,960
So get some rest somewhere.

834
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,940
What?

835
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,200
My mother gave me freedom.

836
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,870
When I gave up on playing Go,

837
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:34,380
she yelled at scolding relatives.

838
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:40,780
How will they hurt her
 feelings today?

839
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:46,680
How I ran away to my first 
workplace, then the army?

840
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,260
How I'm a 2-year contract worker?

841
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,480
Holidays can be

842
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,580
ruthless time your family
 can hurt each other.

843
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,430
I felt bad about leaving

844
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,940
my mom alone

845
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,570
but I think it'll be 
better I stay away.

846
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,560
But

847
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,200
there's nowhere to go.

848
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,180
How did I live such a pitiful life?

849
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,720
I realized I didn't even 
have a friend to

850
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,730
enjoy a cup of coffee, a movie 
nor a riverside walk with.

851
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,620
Where should I put this?

852
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,940
Here.

853
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,300
Take this first.

854
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,160
Is there anything I can help with?

855
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,900
You're Geu Rae in Sales Team 3, right?

856
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,840
Yes.

857
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,460
Why'd you come on a holiday?

858
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,160
Don't overwork yourself 
when you're a temp.

859
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,940
They won't make you a full-timer.

860
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,500
Dang "temp."

861
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,910
There's

862
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,600
nowhere for me to go today.

863
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,400
I think I was wrong.

864
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,820
I wasn't thinking.

865
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,940
I shouldn't have left 
my mom alone.

866
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:24,740
My Geu Rae showed promise 
ever since he played Go.

867
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,280
- He?
- Please.

868
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,160
Don't make excuses for me.

869
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:34,660
I knew he'd make it big long ago.

870
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,490
He always comes late since

871
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,390
they need him all the time.

872
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:45,860
This higher-up came to visit

873
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,960
him when he was working late!

874
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,520
So many people would visit 
him when he played Go.

875
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,680
People would come 
left and right, gosh!

876
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,270
You know how good he looks in suits?

877
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,640
He even looked great

878
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,220
in his dad's old suit 
that doesn't even fit.

879
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:11,560
He looked like he was born

880
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,400
to work at a company.

881
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,120
And is it just a normal company?

882
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,880
It's one of the top 
5 trading companies!

883
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,040
Sis-in-law, ok.

884
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,020
You're so proud when he's a temp,

885
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,400
imagine when he's a full-timer.

886
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:38,080
Hey, you think temps are for everyone?

887
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:43,380
My Geu Rae suffers so much?

888
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,300
Sis-in-law, don't cry.

889
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:54,380
I only smiled as I didn't want to

890
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,360
discourage him after he failed in Go.

891
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,060
Now he's smiling at us

892
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,270
when he's suffering inside!

893
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,620
That's how Geu Rae is like!

894
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,940
Ok, have a drink.

895
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,420
Let's not forget it.

896
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,540
I'm my mom's pride.

897
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,600
I'm not a disappointing son.

898
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,380
Hello.

899
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,100
Hello.

900
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:28,750
You had an eye for people.

901
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,800
Mr. Oh.

902
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,660
Shall we have a cup of tea?

903
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,940
Geu Rae.

904
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,020
I'm going to get coffee, 
you want a cup?

905
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,080
I'll make mine.

906
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,400
Ok.

907
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,940
You better start the new business.

908
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,960
Yes, we're working hard.

909
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,120
Is he on it again?

910
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,860
Jang Geu Rae?

911
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,800
Sit down.

912
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,680
It's interesting.

913
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,180
Interesting, indeed.

914
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,180
He's just focused on work without

915
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,460
any concerns or calculations.

916
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,050
Like a daredevil.

917
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,440
Like you-know-who.

918
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,220
Actually he reminds 
me of you, Mr. Oh.

919
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,990
It's fun when you decide on an 
item and learn the business.

920
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,340
You remember then?

921
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:54,880
When we were the first to secure 
germanium in the East Sea.

922
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,470
We were running about looking 
for refinery facilities.

923
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,240
We worked on many cases 
without insurance.

924
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:11,920
After we heard that company 
couldn't go manufacturing,

925
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,780
they wanted full compensation.

926
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:19,020
So a few were fired to 
take responsibility.

927
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,360
We got through that too.

928
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,800
You know, Mr. Oh

929
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,420
I mean Sang Sik.

930
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,240
Sometimes

931
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,260
I wonder why you

932
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,110
grew distant from me.

933
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,980
We were tight like comrades in war?

934
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:51,620
The only person fired was Lee Eun Ji.

935
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,190
Who?

936
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,120
The one who died.

937
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,900
I think she did something wrong.

938
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:18,400
Now I see why you're still 
like this in Sales Team 3.

939
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:22,160
You fool.

940
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,980
You bent over backwards

941
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:29,020
to protect temps then too.

942
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:36,260
Will you do that this 
time too with Geu Rae?

943
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:45,410
I'll drink the tea next time.

944
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:47,410
Didn't you say

945
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,010
you'd take responsibility then?

946
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,960
Didn't you?

947
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,800
Did you say you wouldn't 
take responsibility?

948
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,820
I can't remember.

949
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,080
If Lee Eun Ji can't,

950
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,000
will you take responsibility?

951
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,660
Will you take responsibility?

952
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,980
Take a deep breath.

953
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,120
Mr. Choi

954
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,440
couldn't remember Eun Ji.

955
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,100
He's just acting like he can't.

956
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,540
No, he really can't.

957
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,140
Since she's not worth remembering,

958
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:28,820
that's the way he works instinctively.

959
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:35,510
He perfectly erased himself
from that incident.

960
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:41,850
So perfectly that
 he could fool himself.

961
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,580
It's his instinct, not intention.

962
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,940
That's why he's a scary man.

963
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,720
He used to tell Eun Ji every day

964
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:05,220
what you'd see in self-help books.

965
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,340
"Go to night college."

966
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,560
"Dream big."

967
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,120
"Effort will pay off."
"Work hard and you'll see a road."

968
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,890
She was smart.

969
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,560
She'd be alive if 
I had known my place

970
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,280
She would've worked comfortably,

971
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,170
met a nice guy,

972
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,440
got married,

973
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,560
and lived happily, right?

974
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,410
Since she's a good girl.

975
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,420
She told me with smile,

976
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,560
"Thank you, Mr. Oh.

977
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,900
I just have to continue 
working like this, right?"

978
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,910
Geu Rae asked me 
the same thing.

979
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,580
I'll become a full-timer 
like this, right?

980
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,380
I said he can't make it.

981
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,150
Mr. Oh.

982
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:31,060
Times are tougher than Eun Ji's.

983
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,780
Empty hope

984
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,180
and irresponsible 
consolation are useless.

985
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,780
It's scarier we live in a world 
where irresponsible

986
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:53,980
consolation and empty
 hope can't be given.

987
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:57,150
Since there are so many who are

988
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,250
desperate for that
 empty hope at least.

989
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,740
Still

990
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,140
he won't make it.

991
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:44,060
[Misaeng]

992
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,800
I can't even drink 
water in front of you.

993
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,830
Do it over.

994
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:50,070
Mr. Oh's treating Geu Rae 
differently this year.

995
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:53,240
One of us were sacrificed for him.

996
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,800
What a tough life.

997
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,800
If you have time to think about 
others, work on your weak points.

998
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,300
If I get a step closer, I'm two 
steps further the next day.

999
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,800
- Geu Rae, $100?
- Probably?

1000
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,980
Tell him to take Baek Ki.

1001
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,980
You said you'd sell anything.
