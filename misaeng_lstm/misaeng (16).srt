Suk Yool chose to keep his mouth shut.

He was erasing time

00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,960
by training how to numb himself.

took Resource Team 2's side?

Don?t do it.

167
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,410

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,660
But they're both ideas 
from teams under Mr. Ma.

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,200

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,030
The team that backed him up failed.

187
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,160
What would happen if a female 
newbie's idea is chosen?

188
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
Think of it as 
Mr. Ma's long-term race.

189
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,180
They put so much effort into 
people who back them up.

190
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,100
Office politics give 
you a headache, right?

191
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,380
Avoiding isn't the answer.

192
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
I checked it.

193
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,490
Ours always changes, so 
check the forwarded content.

194
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,020
Thank you.

195
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,560
Life itself is politics, not just work.

196
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,820
You got to get used to it.

197
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,060
That way, you can survive.

198
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,360
Anyway, mind your own business.

199
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,620
- Focus on your first business.
-Yes.

200
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,040
Bring in big profits and 
treat us to a big dinner.

201
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,720
- Yes.
- Beef.

202
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,810
- Beef?
- Sounds good, right?

203
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,380
Yeah.

204
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,060
Regular spandex can't be dyed 
in the manufacturing process,

205
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,510
but One International factory's

206
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,240
spandex is dyed in acid dyes.

207
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,520
Yes, I'll send you the sample.

208
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,530
I'll sort out the rest 
and email it to you.

209
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,600
Yes, thank you.

210
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,280
Suk Yool, coffee.

211
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,720
Mr. Sung does me proud.

212
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,680
The US market isn't easy.

213
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,300
10,000,000 yards of sofa fabric.

214
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,380
The bosses showered me
 with compliments.

215
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,700
The factory is running fine, right?

216
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,380
Of course, they said they 
can meet the deadline.

217
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,690
But

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,780
I'm worried.

219
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,200
It'll be tough with only our factory.

220
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,720
Don?t worry.

221
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,030
Subcontractors would 
decrease our profits.

222
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,360
It's not like we can't do it.

223
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,540
Nice, nice.

224
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,640
What would we do without you?

225
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,800
Hello.

226
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,600
You seem to be going through puberty.

227
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,020
You're so quiet now.

228
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,500
Oh.

229
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,940
Are you already in that phase at work?

230
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,180
That's early.

231
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,300
That usually comes after two years.

232
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,440
Sir.

233
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,400
I don't think our own factory can 
do it without subcontractors.

234
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,490
Even if they go all-in, there 
are other team's work too.

235
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,040
I don't think it'll be possible.

236
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,840
Mr. Sung said he talked 
it over with the factory.

237
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,640
They said it's possible too.

238
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,260
Don?t worry.

239
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm sure Mr. Sung knows 
what he's doing.

240
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,180
Hot!

241
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,740
The data?

242
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
What are you doing?

243
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,600
What?

244
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,700
That's from KOTRA.

245
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,920
Yes.

246
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,200
It says in Kazakhstan,

247
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,760
they greet you and say their 
names even if you're a stranger.

248
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,620
- In Kazakhstan?
- Yes.

249
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,620
What else?

250
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,460
When you shake hands, 
you take a strong grip.

251
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,910
A strong grip?
What else?

252
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,040
You hug people you're close with.

253
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,120
Hug?

254
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,920
What if you love them?

255
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,000
- It should be on the next page.
- Next page?

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,860
But why are your ears red already?

257
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,520
You want a double sniff of my cologne?

258
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,680
Oh?

259
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,300
What does it say next?

260
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,280
Sales Team 3?

261
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,560
Yes, sir.

262
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,180
Change the person in charge?

263
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,070
Yes.

264
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,720
They said Geu Rae won't do.

265
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Resubmit it by Mr. Chun and Mr. Kim.

266
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,000
What's the reason?

267
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,060
He's a contract employee 
with less than a year to go.

268
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,500
It's not a long-term business.

269
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,340
It's a two month case and Geu Rae 
can pull it off with responsibility.

270
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,780
He's prepared thoroughly 
and no one can do?

271
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,760
Mr. Oh.

272
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,690
You really thought so?

273
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,300
You thought Geu Rae could 
take full responsibility?

274
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,520
No one thinks so here.

275
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,260
Including the company rules.

276
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,200
I'll

277
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,160
meet with the Chief of Planning.

278
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,300
Chief of Planning?

279
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,880
Why do you keep causing trouble?

280
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,720
He's just a contract employee.

281
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,300
Just resubmit it by the others.

282
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,460
There have never been any 
contract employees in Sales.

283
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,840
So there are no rules for that.

284
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,800
No?

285
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,720
Right, they're all full-timers.

286
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,480
If there are no rules, 
couldn't we make a precedent?

287
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,810
Precedent?

288
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,160
No.

289
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,200
The plan is to make a rule 
that it won't be allowed.

290
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,400
That will prevent these issues.

291
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,660
Issues?

292
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,440
Sir, this is unfair.

293
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,180
- Geu Rae?
- Mr. Oh.

294
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,000
An infrastructure is built for the 
companies and buyers for a new business.

295
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,240
The company's conclusion is

296
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,420
Geu Rae, a temp, can't handle that.

297
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,640
Related businesses are created

298
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
even after the business ends.

299
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,380
It?s the company's loss if the person 
in charge changes midway.

300
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,860
So it's absurd to exclude the person 
who created the new business to

301
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,460
make the new infrastructure?

302
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,700
Geez.

303
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,650
I'm not getting through to you.

304
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
I'll make it simple.

305
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,600
Why would the company invest 
in someone who'll leave?

306
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,380
Geu Rae's been on that 
proposal for a while.

307
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,060
It's all useless if you're
 going to ignore it!

308
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,170
Mr. Oh, you shouldn't 
get emotional over this.

309
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,060
Why would the company invest 
in someone who'll leave?

310
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,980
I think it's ok.

311
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,220
- Ask Mr. Chun.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,880
- What?
- Yes.

313
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,040
Ok.

314
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,440
How's this?

315
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,900
The conditions aren't bad, but?

316
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,840
Yes.

317
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,570
Let's go with Insun.

318
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,540
Shinsung is good, but they have

319
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,820
little experience and know-how.

320
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,110
But their conditions are the best.

321
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,250
- Contact them.
- Yes.

322
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,700
And have a meeting first?

323
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,220
Yes, thank you.

324
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,560
Sure.

325
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,490
Mr. Oh.

326
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,760
Mr. Oh, that's not fair.

327
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,000
It is what it is.

328
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,440
That's absurd!

329
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,240
You know how Geu Rae didn't even 
get enough sleep for two months.

330
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,720
But we take that?

331
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Submit it with my name?

332
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
No way!
I can't do that!

333
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,990
There's really any other way?

334
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,280
You saw how excited he was about it.

335
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,980
He's about to memorize all 
the Kazakhstan street names.

336
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,430
He's about to get married 
to a bride there.

337
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,120
How could they treat Geu Rae like this?

338
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,830
Since it's a company.

339
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,370
They can do that since it's a company.

340
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,520
But he worked so hard till now!

341
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,960
Don't act like he saved 
the country or something.

342
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,340
He just worked for his salary.

343
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,880
So, will you really do that?

344
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,730
Tell them you won't do it.

345
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,070
Give it over to Team 3.

346
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,180
Email the person in charge 
saying you can't do it.

347
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,960
Just do as Mr. Ma says.

348
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,740
That will give you the least trouble.

349
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,620
This is no competition no 
matter how hard you try.

350
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,740
There's no chance of winning.

351
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,750
I'm not saying, just always back down.

352
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,880
You should know when to 
fight and when to back down.

353
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,090
I'm not saying this 
out of worry for you.

354
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,060
I just don't want further trouble 
and Mr. Ma going insane.

355
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,100
What threat was that?

356
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,310
Nothing.

357
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,280
You think

358
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,300
bosses know everything?

359
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,080
They don't know diddly.

360
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
They can't make the deadline.

361
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,220
Wait and see.

362
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,260
The site won't sit and watch.

363
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,460
Da In.

364
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,370
Hello, this is Jang Baek Ki
 from Steel team.

365
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,000
When do Finance's results regarding

366
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,670
our Indonesia case come in?

367
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,460
Regarding the pipes.

368
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,200
Yes, sir.

369
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,760
And our team's additional 
proposal H-beam case?

370
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,020
No, no.

371
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,400
It's not urgent.

372
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,560
You're still reviewing it?

373
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,360
Baek Ki.

374
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,840
Yes, sir.

375
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,200
Yes.

376
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,960
The Youngjin report is not finished yet?

377
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,440
I just have to print it out.

378
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,920
That and

379
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,100
print out East Europe exports data for

380
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,680
the last two weeks from 
the KOTRA database.

381
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,020
Yes, sir.

382
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,780
Mr. Kim.

383
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,760
It can be provided 20% 
cheaper than Japan,

384
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,560
but it's 20% more 
expensive than Malaysia.

385
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,800
How should I persuade the buyer?

386
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,800
- This?
- Yes.

387
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,380
Even though it's cheap, 
it won't withstand heat.

388
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,840
There were lots of complaints 
when there were cracks, right?

389
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,360
Yes.

390
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,430
Didn't you choose them since few 
products withstand 80 degrees?

391
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,360
Yes, but

392
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,610
it's a new company.

393
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,400
Mr. Oh...

394
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,140
You should go with the good conditions.

395
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,760
They'll build know-how with time.

396
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,860
Yes.

397
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,980
Sales Team 3 Jang Geu Rae speaking.

398
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,340
Hello. I see.

399
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,810
I'll be right down.

400
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,080
They brought documents.

401
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
- I'll go get them.
- Ok.

402
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,840
He just wants to run with others.

403
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,180
And they want us to break his legs?

404
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,660
Mr. Chun.

405
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,460
Don't mess with these items.

406
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,880
I know there was a similar business.

407
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,740
But the conditions and 
profits are better?

408
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,960
Mr. Chun.

409
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,110
You can't work on those items.

410
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,960
You shouldn?t work on them.

411
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,880
What do you mean?

412
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,320
Those items were only done by the elite
 employees from open recruitment.

413
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
You know what I mean?

414
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,390
You weren't even chosen 
by open recruitment.

415
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,620
Thought you had learned experience

416
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,820
comes second when 
working for Sales Team 3.

417
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,990
Why don't you get it?

418
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,140
What will you do?

419
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,620
Geu Rae will be so disappointed.

420
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
No way.

421
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,940
It's not the end of the world just 
because the person in charge changed.

422
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,180
But it looks like the end of 
the world for you, Mr. Oh.

423
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,400
Me?

424
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,740
No way.

425

I know.

426
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,700
You can't do anything this time.

427
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,500
This is different from Dong Sik's case.

428
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,820
I can't tell you to go 
to Mr. Choi this time.

429
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,660
Just comfort him.

430
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,120
Uh, are you from Shinsung?

431
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,900
Are you in Sales Team 3?

432
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,860
Yes.

433
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,840
I'm Han Sung Jin from Shinsung.

434
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,520
- Yes.
- Here.

435
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,740
I didn't bring my card.

436
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,090
It's ok.

437
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,300
Thanks.

438
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,920
We're behind in our career, 
but we really work hard.

439
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,740
The whole company has 
high hopes for this.

440
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,180
I see.

441
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,100
If you give it to us, you 
won't be disappointed.

442
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,160
We'll take a good look.

443

Thank you.

You did Mr. Park's case and 
the Jordan case, right?

457

I thought, what a daring new employee.

458
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,140
I wondered who it was.

to Youngsung's Mr. Kim.

Yes.

472
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,400
Ok.

high hopes for this.

484

The person in charge 
should know what to do.

485

You prepared so much 
and kept asking others.

486

00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,200
I was confident about pizza.

549
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,860
When I was a resident employee,

550
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,740
and since I ate so much 
on business trips.

551
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,600
It wasn't a name brand,

552
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
but rumors spread.

553
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,040
It was introduced on the Internet too.

554
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,250
But business hasn't been good?

555
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,260
We closed it after a market opened.

556
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,100
I used the funds I received 
when I left work

557
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,660
and also got a big loan.

558
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,240
I thought I'd start a new life.

559
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,660
Mr. Kim, Mr. Chun.

560
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,940
Yes.

561
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,740
Mr. Oh hasn?t taken care of it yet?

562
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,340
Why hasn't he submitted it?

563
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,460
Excuse me?

564
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,640
Geu Rae's Kazakhstan case.

565
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,440
I told him to change 
the person in charge.

566
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,140
Uh?

567
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,140
Mr. Oh didn't tell you?

568
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,600
Why won't he listen to me?

569
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,480
I made sure he'd understand.

570
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,820
He checked with Planning 
too, what's he doing?

571
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,550
Sir?

572
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,360
One of you two take it.

573
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,320
Why are you acting so foolish?

574
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,960
I know you care about him.

575
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,100
He's a temp. It's not realistic.

576
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,200
What does a person in charge do?

577
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,920
He takes responsibility until the end.

578
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,380
When Mr. Oh comes in, 
tell him to submit it.

579
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,680
Bye.

580
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,160
Bye.

581
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,380
Hello.

582
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,960
Geu Rae.

583
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,620
This is insane.

584
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,570
Sorry, there's no room.

585
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,260
Ok, go ahead.

586
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,400
Maybe I should've hung in there then.

587
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,500
Go along with the politics.

588
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,000
Maybe I should've

589
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,650
at least acted like I was 
lining up with the authorities.

590
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,590
I can't sleep

591
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,440
out of regret.

592
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,180
I'd go on 3-4 overseas

593
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,300
business trips a month.

594
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,170
The kids wanted gifts 
thinking I went sightseeing.

595
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,880
But then

596
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,250
I thought I was doing 
a great job as a trading man.

597
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,380
But it's all useless.

598
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,740
My wife is sacrificing so much.

599
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,000
I can't watch my kids grow up.

600
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,360
Hey.

601
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,400
Remember that time?

602
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,680
Back then, our business 
partner was something else.

603
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,100
I kept going to their embassy every day
 and asked for so much info.

604
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,200
It was when you were new.

605
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,260
We still talk about you over drinks.

606
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,480
Right.

607
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,440
So much ambition.

608
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,120
We'd grab them by the collar.

609
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,730
"Give us the data."

610
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,100
"I need to make a living too."

611
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,530
It was like war.

612
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,560
I gave him a good shake.

613
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,970
He became so obedient.

614
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,060
Trading men aren't ambitious 
like that these days.

615
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,300
You can't afford it now.

616
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,230
The company is like 
a battlefield, you said?

617
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,480
Don't quit until you're kicked out.

618
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,280
Outside?

619
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,510
it's hell.

620
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:53,330
I'll have to go out to the battle.

621
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,910
Yeah?

622
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,470
Then I'll

623
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,870
go back to hell.

624
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,470
- Don't see me off.
- It's ok.

625
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,470
Don't see me off.

626
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,510
We ended up drinking.

627
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,170
You should go back.

628
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,770
- Go on.
- Ok.

629
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,270
I should've brought you a gift.

630
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,210
Buy your kids a snack or something.

631
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,910
I'm sorry about coming empty-handed.

632
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,780
What is this?

633
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,150
Just accept it.

634
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,180
Take it. Bye!

635
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,390
Bye.

636
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,190
Bye!

637
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,560
Buy your kids a snack or something.

638
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,350
I need to work again.

639
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:23,090
I want to find the line I left behind.

640
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,910
The overseas companies will 
still remember me.

641
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,190
I left and I was so mad back then.

642
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,860
But I need to work again.

643
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,430
I have no choice.

644
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,170
Help me out.

645
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,410
Mr. Oh.

646
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,830
Yeah.

647
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,060
What?

648
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,160
Uh, Geu Rae found out as

649
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,810
he overheard us speaking.

650
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,830
So?

651
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,840
He won't answer his calls.

652
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,430
The companies are calling us too.

653
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,850
It's ok.
It's not like the country failed.

654
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,370
He'll come back.

655
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,930
Do your work.

656
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,130
Yes.

657
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,070
One International, 
Kim Dong Sik speaking.

658
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,070
Jang Geu Rae?

659
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:47,930
He's not at his desk right now.

660
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,700
Okay.

661
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,190
What are you doing here?

662
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,990
Mr. Oh.

663
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,870
The companies are calling 
the person in charge.

664
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,290
You're not answering them.

665
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,690
We can't back you up!

666
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,210
We're not a call center!

667
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,130
Come down.

668
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,550
I'll go to the Trade Insurance Corp.

669
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,890
Ok.

670
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,610
Mr. Chun.

671
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,890
Yes, sir.

672
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,670
How's your team these days?

673
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,030
Everything ok?

674
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,830
I'm sorry?

675
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,470
Geez.

676
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,110
Mr. Oh has a condition.

677
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,650
A mental condition.

678
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,430
He keeps at it though 
he knows the results.

679
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,850
Age doesn't change him.

680
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,150
It's useless.

681
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:33,470
But I like that about him sometimes.

682
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,930
Sir.

683
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:48,630
Can you possibly help Geu Rae out?

684
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,320
I'm sorry.

685
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,810
Why are you dragging for half a day?

686
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,200
Wouldn't she need time to calm down?

687
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,060
She worked on it for a long time.

688
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,810
You.

689
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,350
Were you always this emotional?

690
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,410
Don?t act so soft just 
because she's the first girl.

691
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,030
Hey, Mr. Jung.

692
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,080
Yes.

693
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,830
Don't you want to get promoted?

694
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,550
Wow.

695
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,450
What a gloomy day.

696
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,670
Young Yi.

697
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,170
Yes.

698
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,040
Can't you give up?

699
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,730
Then let's say I'm asking you 
a favor on this.

700
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,020
Excuse me?

701
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,650
I have a promotion review.

702
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:11,920
Let's support

703
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,060
Mr. Ma.

704
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,290
But none of us could dare

705
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:18,170
to give each other advice.

706
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,650
It's been 17 months since 
we started working.

707
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,350
We know clearly by now.

708
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:30,050
You have to withstand 
hardships by yourself.

709
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,450
You were right.

710
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,510
My item?

711
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,010
My item

712
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:54,010
actually won't work out.

713
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,670
You really think so?

714
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,110
Yes.

715
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,770
I hadn't thought it out.

716
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,540
I already emailed the headquarters.

717
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,670
What?

718
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,670
The factory is boycotting?

719
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,990
What?

720
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,420
-They're coming?
-Where is he?

721
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,590
I told you we can't work!

722
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,890
Mister.

723
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,700
We made it clear we can't do it.

724
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,290
It's just an impossible mission!

725
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,370
Other teams have orders too!

726
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:48,070
We've only been getting

727
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:50,770
3-4 hours of sleep a day!

728
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,850
You want us to work the old machines?

729
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,510
The manager clearly promised me

730
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,890
to make the deadline!

731
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,130
We know you forced us to do it.

732
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,420
You said we had no choice!

733
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,890
The manager promised me,

734
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,760
so you can go argue with him!

735
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,070
Hey, listen!

736
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,050
Old machines are still machines.

He said they work too!

738
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,630
You guys are so ignorant.

739
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,430
- What?
- What?

740
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,570
Ignorant?

741
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,450
If you don?t go back to work today,

742
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,480
it'll all be your faults.

743

When Sales makes an order,

744
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,090
the factory should just do it!

745
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,210
And it's been promised!

746
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,170
If you have the time 
and energy to do this,

747
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,870
you should go back and start working!

748
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:45,770
Gosh, let's go.

749
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,570
We were crazy to think we 
could get through to them.

750
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,570
Fine!

751
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,610
Do whatever you want!

752
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,630
We'll go on strike starting tomorrow!

753
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,630
- Let's go!
- Uh...

754
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,510
This is ridiculous.

755
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,980
How can you treat me like this?

756
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,250
You guys are all responsible for 
the loss with the subcontractors!

757

Mr. Sung!

758
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,290
- Suk Yool, do something.
- What?

759
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,450
You worked as an intern 
in Ulsan, right?

760

We can't get our work done like that.

761
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:18,310
Persuade them so they 
don?t go on strike.

00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,530
What can I do?

763
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,610
You must be able to talk to them.

764
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,430
You said you know people at the site.

765
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,650

00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,750

responsibility if anything happens.

769
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,290
Yes, sir.

770
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:35,950
I'll take care of it.

What? Meal?

if you go on strike,

785
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,930
it's your loss too.

Loss?

787
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:14,910
You always valued the site, 
but now you're one of them.

788
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,510
Now that you sit in the office, you

789
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,970
can just make orders to the factory?

happen just by forcing us!

Ahjusshi, excuse me, boss.

00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,190

Is your husband home?

884
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:37,690
He'll be probably drinking nearby.

885
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,590
It's tough, right?

886
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:45,090
It's just that my husband 
can't accept the fact.

887
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,850

01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:06,390
Why'd you come to my house?

889
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,170
You could just call.

890
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,890
Don't do this.

891
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,210
How will you face your kids?

Keep sober.

01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:33,430
If you're drunk, you can't do anything 
when new opportunities come.

894
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,170
It's dangerous to be drunk 
when you're successful.

895
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:41,490
But it's dangerous to be drunk 
when things aren't going well.

896
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,410

897

He works hard without procrastination.

899
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:56,060
But he's different from you.

900
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,970
He works hard but

901
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,790
it's natural and he's passionate,

902
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:06,350
but still rational.

903
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:13,680
The young guy's not drunk.

904
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,370
I'll get going.

905
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:24,370

Mr. Kim?

907
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:32,430
He started a business after quitting.

908
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:35,360
He just watched me get kicked out.

909
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,130
He started with three employees,

910
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:41,530
but he's struggling without an expert.

911
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,090
Go see him.

912
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,990
Was he fired too?

913
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:49,340
You know what it's like.

914
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,340
Fire and getting fired.

915
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,120
Come on, no hatred.

916
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,710
There's no hatred.

917
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:08,110
Oh, the guy you mentioned

918
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:09,650
who's not drunk.

919
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:10,930
Yes.

920
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,170
Make sure this doesn?t happen to him.

921
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:18,890
It's not up to us.

922
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,070
I hope he succeeds.

923
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,350
That guy.

924
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,340
Mr. Oh.

925
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,340
Are you home?

926
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:58,710
Yes.

927
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,220
Ok.

928
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,120
Geu Rae.

929
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,360
Yes, Mr. Oh.

930
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,130
Don't be drunk.

931
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:18,530
Yes.

932
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,530
Bye.

933
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,050
Right,

934
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:35,610
I'm not drunk.

935
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,480
You were right.

936
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,420
But realistically we can't give 
it to a contract employee.

937
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,730
Then you go to the site!

938
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,390
Let's go.

939
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:52,130
I can't be drunk.

940
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,350
Even if I lose a stone,

941
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,530
the game must go on.

942
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:09,980
I couldn?t do it.

943
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,570
I'll hire a subcontractor.

944
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:18,190
Suk Yool!

945
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:21,370
You were acting arrogant 
and what have you done?

946
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:25,430
You couldn't send the 
employees back to the site!

947
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,610
You shouldn't disregard the site.

948
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:45,330
We shouldn't give them work for the

949
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,330
old machines and just badger them.

950
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,330
It wasn't possible to begin with.

951
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:52,450
Mr. Sung must've known 
it was impossible too.

952
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:53,690
What?

953
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,790
Hey.

954
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:03,070
You better choose good subcontractors.

955
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,910
If you can't find them by today,

956
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:08,470
the factory can't ever 
meet the deadline!

957
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,870
Mr. Sung!

958
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,970
Do what you can to 
find subcontractors.

959
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:17,750
If you can't,

960
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:21,050
our performances will be bad 
and we'll have a huge debt.

961
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,450
That would mean trouble.

962
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,850
I'll find them.

963
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:30,990
It would've been better 
to use the old machines.

964
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:43,690
Sir, this is Han Suk Yool in Fabric.

965
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:47,690
Please work as hard as you 
can without the old machines.

966
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:50,530
We'll find subcontractors 
and fill in what we can.

967
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,430
Ok, thanks.

968
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:55,590
But it won't be easy to 
find subcontractors now.

969
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,750
We'll do our best.

How can you not do further checks?

Then will you take responsibility 
for not doing so up to now?

on credit like that?

company has insurance.

you get insurance money?
