180
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,130
Since it's much more likely 
 it'll succeed as you said.

181
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,260
If only we make it, we'll…

182
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,300
Are you done?

183
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,450
What?

184
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,830
You didn't go for the demonstration?

185
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,070
The China electronics researchers are 
coming for product demonstration.

186
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,470
- I told you yesterday.
- Oh, right, geez…

187
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,740
Did Mr. Oh leave?

188
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,510
Yes, he did.

189
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,080
He looked miserable with worries 
as if it was the end of the world.

190
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,130
But he made it there?

191
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,210
He said he needs to go to see 
if there's anything to sell.

192
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,710
He's coming now.

193
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,270
The blabbermouth 
factory manager too.

194
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,230
Oh, Mr. Ko!

195
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,750
- How are you?
- Good.

196
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,430
- Take care.
- Sure.

197
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,110
Oh, you're so good-looking.

198
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,070
Hi.

199
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,270
Oh, my, you keep getting prettier.

200
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,550
Hello.

201
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,410
Oh, our ramen hair Mr. Kim, 
nice to see you.

202
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,510
Take the jade cushion back.

203
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,650
It hurts my bottom.

204
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,990
You don't know what 
you're talking about.

205
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,520
You need to get over that, the 
same thing happens with medicine.

206
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,510
You're all talk.

207
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,990
Sir, why didn't you send us the 
report after the claim was resolved?

208
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,860
I asked you a few times.

209
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,150
I'll tell them to send it right away.

210
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,570
You really don't need anything?

211
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,710
No.

212
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,830
- What about a jade mat…
- I don't need it.

213
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,310
- What about a jade pillow…
- I don't need it!

214
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,010
Mr. Kim is so diligent.

215
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,170
You work so hard.

216
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,810
When will you get promoted?

217
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,470
I've only had this position
for three years.

218
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,620
Then won't you be 
promoted next year?

219
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,270
Then Mr. Ramen-hair will 
be Manager Kim.

220
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,650
But

221
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,990
it took years for you 
two to get promoted too.

222
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,010
Drop it, will you?

223
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,030
Oh, not you, Mr. Ko.

224
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,990
You can't just make 
it by putting in time.

225
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,010
Right, Mr. Oh?

226
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,420
Hello.

227
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,890
Who's this?

228
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,050
I've never seen him before.

229
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,210
This is our new employee.

230
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,610
He's the China factory 
manager, Mr. Seo Jin Sang.

231
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,090
He sits there, Jang Geu Rae.

232
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,400
Hello, I'm Jang Geu Rae.

233
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,550
Nice to meet you.

234
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,150
I'm Seo Jin Sang.

235
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,500
Your team must've really grown.

236
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,550
With these visually outstanding 
new employees and all.

237
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,280
How many new employees are there?

238
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,940
Excuse me?

239
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,500
<i>Have you heard of Baekdusan deer honey?</i>

240
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,980
Here, come on.

241
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,950
Ok, ok.

242
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,320
You know about <i>sanghwang</i> mushrooms.

243
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,980
They're effective and expensive.

244
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,920
Deer on Baekdusan eat none

245
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,180
other than those rare mushrooms.

246
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,000
Then they poop.

247
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,280
The round droplets fall.

248
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,880
Then flowers bloom from the poop.

249
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,120
Then bees work hard to make 
honey from those flowers.

250
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,910
That is Baekdusan deer honey.

251
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,380
- Poop?
- Poop?

252
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,920
Imagine how rare it is.

253
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,360
Flowers don’t always 
bloom from deer's poop!

254
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,780
That's ridiculous.

255
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,020
It's good for men's stamina.

256
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,200
It's so good and…

257
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,500
I can't explain it.

258
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,720
I didn't make it to sell it.

259
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,930
You can tell by the packaging, right?

260
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,200
You can leave since 
it's good for men.

261
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,420
It's useless for women.

262
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,280
It's great for men only.

263
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,340
I guarantee that.

264
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,380
But it's good for the skin.

265
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,480
This?

266
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,290
You should all taste it.

267
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,620
Here.

268
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,160
Here, take it.

269
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,200
Here, here.

270
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,820
You should all taste it.

271
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,160
Don't waste it.

272
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,860
Don't be greedy.

273
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,880
Yeah.

274
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,840
Geu Rae.

275
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,940
What?

276
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,760
What's the staring?

277
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,200
You think this is fake or something?

278
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,700
No, sir.

279
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,330
Ok.

280
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,700
I have a small inn in 
a Gwanghwamun alley.

281
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,540
I'll give you my contact info.

282
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,930
Call me if you change your mind.

283
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,740
Inn?

284
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,240
They all think you're in a hotel.

285
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,180
Oh, I can't stay at hotels.

286
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,100
I can't sleep with 
the commotion and all.

287
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,880
Even when I go abroad, 
I don't stay in hotels.

288
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,090
Isn't it a waste when you're 
only sleeping there?

289
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,240
This is how I roll.

290
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,640
I'm frugal.

291
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,090
And I'm showing you this valuable…

292
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,080
You know what I'm saying?

293
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,840
Even rich people can't 
buy this rare stuff.

294
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,060
You don't know what I'm saying.

295
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,940
Ok, good day.

296
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Have three spoonfuls a day with meals.

297
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,660
Geez.

298
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,100
She acted like a smart one alone.

299
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm surprised you're 
really naïve, Young Yi.

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,900
What?

301
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,520
No.

302
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,000
I like it, great.

303
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,440
- Three spoonfuls a day with meals?
- Yes.

304
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,080
I'll take it regularly.

305
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,610
Thanks, Young Yi.

306
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,610
This is just sugar water…

307
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,880
Be quiet.

308
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,650
I don't want it.

309
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,380
Hey, it's Baekdusan deer honey!

310
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,920
Have a spoonful a day 
with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

311
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,870
- Baek Ki.
- Yes.

312
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,620
You've been duped.

313
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,980
Excuse me?

314
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,900
Thanks, anyway.

315
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,180
Deer honey?

316
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,200
Good for men's stamina 
and women's skin?

317
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,920
I'm giving it to my mom.

318
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
- Yeah?
- Yes.

319
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,330
She'll hit you with the fish tail.

320
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,330
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

321
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,430
Just help him out since he's needy.

322
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,000
He's a good guy deep inside.

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,060
What?

324
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,240
Mr. Chun.

325
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,480
You know Mr. Seo too, right?

326
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,980
Yes, we know he dupes us.

327
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,640
Dupes us?

328
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,350
It's weird, where did 
my fountain pen go?

329
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,020
I'm sure it was here.

330
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,620
It's so weird.

331
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,190
<i>This is how I roll.</i>

332
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,880
Oh, it's deer honey.

333
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,630
Yes!

334
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,600
What?

335
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,730
I'll be stationed abroad!

336
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,070
Where, when?

337
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,220
- Singapore, next May!
- Show me.

338
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,500
Great!

339
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,660
You know how hard I tried 
to send you, right?

340
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,900
Of course!

341
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,750
That's great.

342
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,240
Yes.

343
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,900
-What's this?
- What?

344
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,720
Mr. Yoo in Resource Team 2 is going too?

345
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,780
England?

346
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,360
When he only had his 
position for a year?

347
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,290
That's too soon.

348
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,660
Their team is just on a roll.

349
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,300
Gosh.

350
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,960
Mr. Hwang.
Congratulations.

351
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,130
Thanks.

352
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,420
Good job.

353
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,670
Shouldn't you give your family a call?

354
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,540
- Yeah.
- Call them.

355
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,600
Great.

356
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,480
- So many people go this time…
- Yes.

357
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,220
We'll miss you.

358
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,810
It'll happen next year.

359
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,400
- Mr. Hwang.
- <i>Yes?</i>

360
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,290
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

361
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,580
Honey!

362
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,690
We're going to Singapore!

363
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,720
I told you I'd go!

364
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,040
Of course!

365
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,870
Yeah!

366
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,010
Gosh.

367
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,700
Mr. Hwang sure is lucky.

368
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,000
Remember all the trouble 
he overcame last time?

369
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,550
- Yeah, Mr. Ko worked so hard then.
- Yes.

370
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,560
I had high hopes to be honest.

371
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Mm-hmm.

372
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,820
With Mr. Park's incident and 
the Jordan case and all.

373
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,400
Though I don't have to go.

374
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,480
You should!

375
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,820
Working abroad is the highlight for us.

376
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,900
I think I should've gone to 
Congo when they told me to.

377
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,620
After I rejected that,

378
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,180
I haven't gotten any offers.

379
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,100
I don't even hope for 
America or Europe.

380
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,640
That one refusal must've 
made a bad impression.

381
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm sure that's not why.

382
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,750
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,100
What?

384
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,400
No!

385
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,720
Come on.

386
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,990
What are you saying?

387
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,090
I'll go get some air.

388
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,730
Can the San Paolo items be 
delivered by the deadline?

389
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,740
Yes, we'll check the process 
again with Chungsol.

390
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,460
- Chungsol?
- Yes.

391
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,880
Ok.

392
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,070
Tell Chungsol's Mr. Lee to

393
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,160
meet the deadline this time.

394
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,880
It was delayed last time, right?

395
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,580
Was it?

396
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,780
Yes, I'll make sure he meets

397
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,820
it this time, so don’t worry.

398
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,990
Ok.

399
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,430
What?

400
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,660
You know Chungsol is always 
late on deliveries.

401
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,440
- So what do you want me to do?
- We can't work with them.

402
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,810
There are other companies.

403
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,510
Geez.

404
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,940
I didn't want to get you in trouble.

405
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,220
I think Youngmin will be better.

406
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,420
Who do you think you are, jerk?

407
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,360
What do you know about that

408
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,120
company to say such crap?

409
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,540
Crap?

410
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, right.

411
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,990
Your nickname as an intern was Dog.

412
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,660
Stop acting like a crapping dog.

413
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,430
You pulled one thing 
off and got arrogant?

414
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,000
I think working with a lazy,

415
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:27,230
irresponsible company 
like Chungsol is worse.

416
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,040
What, jerk?

417
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,030
Stop calling me "jerk", sir.
I have a name.

418
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,880
You should appreciate how 
I didn't embarrass you.

419
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,940
Don't get emotional, 
but look at the facts.

420
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,780
Be rational and reasonable.

421
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,460
Are you related to Chungsol
by any chance?

422
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,500
What, jerk?

423
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,040
You didn't embarrass me?

424
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,580
Yes, sir.

425
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,180
No, sir.

426
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,020
I'll be right there, bye.

427
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,190
You sociopath jerk.

428
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,560
You want to have a go?

429
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,660
Ok, go ahead.

430
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,460
Let's do it, jerk.

431
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,030
Let's see if you'll leave

432
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,520
or I will.

433
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,500
Dang, that hurts.

434
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,380
Oh…

435
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,180
<i>Smoke.</i>

436
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,600
Is Dong Sik

437
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,850
ok?

438
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,260
You know…

439
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,880
Gosh.

440
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,830
The company's so mean.

441
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,920
Congratulations.

442
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,940
Congrats.

443
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,300
Thanks.

444
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,060
I hate work because of the sociopath.

445
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,520
Shall I apply to work abroad too?

446
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,600
Mr. Hwang should treat you to drinks.

447
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,020
He should.

448
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,280
Are you putting it off 
to get married first?

449
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,460
Yeah, that'll be more stable.

450
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,660
Dong Sik got screwed again.

451
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,870
I don't think Mr. Oh cares about

452
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,660
others when he's focused on work.

453
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,200
If you work like a dog anyways,
 isn't it better

454
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,910
to have the results that shows?

455
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,460
He doesn't have a luck for a boss.

456
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,260
He always looks for work.

457
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
Why, that…

458
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,900
But their team gets along.

459
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,300
Is it a Meetup to get along well?

460
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,260
A boss who procures items 
with results is preferable.

461
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,740
Of course!

462
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,660
Good for him and myself.

463
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,960
You get promotions and incentives.

464
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,480
People badmouth them, but 
actually want such teams.

465
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,100
Sales Team 3?

466
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,120
They keep asking for trouble.

467
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,680
Let's go.

468
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,500
Why listen to nonsense?
Come on.

469
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,730
When will he get promoted if the leader 
keeps bringing unprofitable work?

470
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,540
Is he his slave or what?

471
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,750
He's so not helpful.

472
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,700
Mr. Kim is a fool to cover for him.

473
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,040
Why, those, I'll just…

474
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,600
Come on, don't be childish.

475
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,060
Why, those…

476
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,060
Let's go.

477
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
I'm so mad.

478
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,940
This is Kim Dong Sik.

479
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,720
Have you read my email?

480
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,360
Yes, I called to check the costs.

481
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,040
There's a difference from what we sent.

482
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,980
Can we call you back after a meeting?

483
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,160
Yes.

484
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,240
Thank you.

485
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,960
Hello, this is Kim Dong Sik.

486
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,230
The freight criteria must've changed.

487
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,140
Yes, please adjust the costs.

488
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,240
Mr. Hwang.
Come here.

489
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,570
Come here.

490
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,480
We heard you guys talk outside.

491
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,850
Why blabber about it so much?

492
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,100
So, watch what you say.

493
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,520
Geez.

494
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,160
What?

495
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,840
Sorry, we were careless.

496
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,120
I didn't think he would've heard us.

497
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,240
This is crazy!

498
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,600
Why, those…!

499
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,970
<i>You jerks!</i>

500
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,580
Hey, what do you know
 about my boss?

501
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,620
You think you can do 
as much as Mr. Oh?

502
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,500
Mr. Ha.

503
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,890
Mr. Yoo.

504
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,220
Do you guys have a right to say that?

505
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,380
What?

506
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,060
Who do you think you are?

507
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,220
Come on, sit down.

508
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,190
Stop it.

509
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,540
Can't you see he's drunk?

510
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,140
Don't aggravate him now.

511
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,440
Guys.

512
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,480
You know I hate cursing, right?

513
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,040
I'll say one thing today.

514
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,740
You ****ing jerks!

515
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,480
Have you been told off like us?

516
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,720
I was told off so much, 
I can't lose weight.

517
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,420
It's because I keep 
drinking from stress!

518
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,720
- Let go!
- Let's go home.

519
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Let's go home now.

520
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,440
You rude jerks!

521
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,000
Dong Sik is a sociopath too.

522
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,660
What is the world coming to?

523
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,930
What are you saying, jerk?

524
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,920
Why'd you ask me to come 
when I wasn't even there?

525
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,680
That's what colleagues are for.
Remember when we were new?

526
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,350
The four of us couldn't handle 
Dong Sik when he got drunk.

527
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,160
I know, even all of us isn't enough.

528
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,320
Hey, Resource Team started it!

529
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,880
Why, you…

530
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,860
Hey, can't you see I enjoy the work?

531
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,360
How dare you ***ing 
say that about Mr. Oh?

532
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,260
I'll say this, how dare 
you **** around?

533
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,770
Hey.

534
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,960
Hey.

535
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,210
You, hey.

536
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,210
Stop it.

537
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,580
I'll rip your mouth 
if you say crap again.

538
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,550
What?

539
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,600
1, 2, 3.

540
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,960
Hey, let's go.

541
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,600
You ****ing Mr. Sung!

542
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,520
You ****er.

543
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,100
One more soju, please.

544
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,000
Dang.

545
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,380
What?

546
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,360
Geu Rae.

547
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,820
Yes.

548
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,960
What are you doing?

549
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,920
You have lots to do?

550
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,980
No.

551
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,080
Why aren't you leaving?

552
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,500
Since you're not leaving.

553
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,900
Go.

554
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,370
Uh, Mr. Oh.

555
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,440
Is something wrong?

556
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,960
No.

557
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,150
Go.

558
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,800
Ok.

559
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,620
You know,

560
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,360
the people you meet 
can change your life.

561
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,020
If you follow a fly,

562
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,660
you'll end up near a toilet.

563
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,960
<i>If you follow a honeybee,</i>

564
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,130
you'll end up in a flowerbed.

565
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,900
So that's why I'm in a flowerbed.

566
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,620
Yeah.

567
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,030
<i>When will he get promoted if the leader 
keeps bringing unprofitable work?</i>

568
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,120
Is he his slave?

569
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
He's just not helpful.

570
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,950
Mr. Kim is a fool to cover for him.

571
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,260
[Scary wife]

572
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,200
Hi, wife.

573
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,120
<i>This isn't your wife.</i>

574
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
<i>Dad, it's Joon Woo.</i>

575
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,530
My little one!

576
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,530
Ask him if he drank again.

577
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,530
Did you drink again?

578
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,920
No.

579
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,540
He said no.

580
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,860
Big bro came in first for Taekwondo.

581
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,280
I got 100% for my spelling test.

582
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,800
Middle bro came in last.

583
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Tell me one thing at a time.

584
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
You're not busy now?

585
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
You can talk?

586
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,180
Of course, you can.

587
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,520
Middle bro can come in last.

588
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,500
Really?

589
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,680
Then can I come in last too?

590
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,180
Can you share like him?

591
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,400
Then you can.

592
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,520
Mom said only fools share too much.

593
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,960
You need to be selfish 
to become rich.

594
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,440
You know what being selfish is?

595
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,180
Yeah!

596
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,080
I can only be sent to Congo.

597
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,560
So what?

598
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,920
Is that our team's fault?

599
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Is it Mr. Oh's…?

600
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,720
Stop it.

601
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,120
Geez.

602
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,900
I'll do it, I'll do it.

603
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,360
Here.

604
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,480
Hey.

605
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,900
You know where Dong Sik lives?

606
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,930
Not my place, my dad came.

607
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,480
My wife is sick now.

608
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,540
You know my house is tiny.

609
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,710
He's too big for it.

610
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,010
I'm staying at my brother's.

611
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,280
No.

612
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
Why not?

613
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,320
It's all messy.

614
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,060
Find his home phone no. and call it.

615
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,640
He lives alone!

616
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,530
Let's go.

617
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,600
Where are you going?

618
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,740
Hey.

619
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,060
Gosh, you're heavy!

620
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,130
Wow, I never thought I'd 
come here with you guys.

621
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,120
Mr. Sung ran away?

622
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,360
He's amazing.

623
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,380
When did Dong Sik gain 
so much weight?

624
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,260
He's heavier than when he started.

625
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,280
I nearly fainted taking off his pants.

626
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,760
His legs

627
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
look like an elephant.

628
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,640
That's why I said let's call 
his home in the country.

629
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,060
Hey,

630
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,750
we still got together 
thanks to him, right?

631
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,060
Yeah.

632
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
We used to be close first.

633
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,560
Now it's all about performance 
and connections.

634
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,340
Right?

635
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,600
The Resource Team is the best.

636
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,220
Hey.

637
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,880
Come lie down here.

638
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,040
I don't sleep in places like this.
I'm leaving soon.

639
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,160
I'm sorry.

640
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,100
You should take some medicine.

641
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,640
- Sir
- Thanks.

642
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,620
Are you ok?

643
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,010
I feel better now.

644
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,110
<i>See you on the rooftop.</i>

645
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,720
Dong Sik.

646
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,900
Yes.

647
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,980
You want a different team?

648
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,440
What are you talking about?

649
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,810
Our team is difficult.

650
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,280
I heard about yesterday.

651
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,820
I'm sorry.

652
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,340
Don’t worry too much.

653
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,720
I really

654
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,880
don't agree with them.

655
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,000
That's not it…

656
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,180
I'm like that.

657
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
I'm here because I want 
to work like a dog.

658
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,680
You know,

659
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,980
I want it,

660
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,450
but it's not the case with you.

661
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,220
When I'm working, I forget 
about those around me.

662
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,500
- So…
- Mr. Oh.

663
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,100
I like working with you.

664
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,100
That's it.

665
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,280
And I'll take care of myself.

666
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,920
I'll tell you if I want to change teams.

667
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,420
Ok, you're right.

668
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,620
Let's work.

669
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,880
What happened to the Vietnam case?

670
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,460
I got the materials to review,

671
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,880
but Ms. Sun hasn't received the report.

672
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,000
She'll have to come before proceeding…

673
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,520
- Yeah?
- Yes.

674
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,380
I'll get to work within an hour.

675
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,920
Yes, I'll send the report by Tuesday.

676
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,820
Why don't we talk again
 after the report?

677
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,860
Yes.

678
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,420
Yes.

679
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,300
Yes, I already checked the 
Vietnam case on the plane.

680
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,260
Yeah.

681
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,590
We just need higher 
expenses for manpower.

682
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,420
Yeah, tell Sales Team 3.

683
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,840
Yeah, bye.

684
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,540
Sales Team 1, Cha Gyung Ho speaking.

685
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,400
Yes.

686
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,510
What?

687
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,080
What's going on?

688
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,850
Ok.

689
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,880
Bye.

690
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,860
Ms. Sun collapsed, sir.

691
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,890
- An ambulance came near the airport.
- What?

692
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,690
What are you talking about?

693
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,300
Come in.

694
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,960
Hi.

695
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,110
Is she ok?

696
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,240
She'll need an overall checkup.

697
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,120
The main reason is a sleeping 
disorder due to stress from overworking.

698
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,480
She'll need to be hospitalized 
for a few days.

699
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,540
With overtime work and 
the business trip,

700
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,260
it was too much.

701
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,860
Just think of it as an 
opportunity to take a break.

702
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,640
It was too much.

703
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,720
I feel upset and guilty.

704
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,120
I was promoted.

705
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,720
Really?

706
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,320
Congratulations.

707
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,880
But what's with your expression?

708
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,440
Actually, we fought because of that.

709
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,560
I told her to quit since 
I got promoted.

710
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,100
She had a hard time.

711
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,360
Maybe I was too hard on her.

712
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,440
So she'll quit?

713
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,940
No.

714
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,840
She didn't want to quit.

715
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,200
It's a big part of her since

716
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,780
she's worked for 15 years.

717
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,900
She said she needs to protect herself

718
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,840
to love her family.

719
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,790
Mr. Oh, we'll get going now.

720
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,830
Ok, I should go too.

721
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,470
I need to pick up So Mi.

722
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,470
I'll call you next time.

723
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,200
Thank you for your time.

724
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,880
Sure, get going.

725
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,040
Thank you visiting.

726
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,240
Mr. Oh, dissuade Ms. Sun.

727
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,660
The Pakistan export
 case won't get much

728
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,290
credit and the company doesn't like it.

729
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,860
I can't understand why 
she insists on it.

730
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,300
Actually, you two are similar.

731
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,280
Anyway we need her.

732
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,980
Tell her to get lots of 
rest without worrying.

733
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,400
Tell her so she understands 
since you're close.

734
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,720
Sure.

735
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,220
Get going.

736
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,220
I'll stay a bit longer.

737
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,840
You woke up.

738
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,290
Are you ok?

739
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,760
You didn’t have to come.

740
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,090
Come on.

741
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,800
You're getting up, hold on.

742
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,020
It's going down.

743
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,570
Keep still, keep still.

744
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,970
I'm good.

745
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,140
You scared me.

746
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,380
You'll have to stay for a few days.

747
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,320
Mr. Um and Mr. Cha came.

748
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,200
They're telling you 
to get plenty of rest.

749
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,700
They said don't worry about work.

750
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,460
Worry?

751
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,120
You should delay the 
Pakistan case for now.

752
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,400
Get rest,

753
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,740
and work twice as hard 
when you're out.

754
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,600
Maybe I shouldn’t do it.

755
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,100
I don't think I can do this one.

756
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:31,240
If it can't be delayed, Mr. Um 
and Mr. Cha can do it.

757
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,960
Or

758
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,250
is it because your husband 
told you to stop working?

759
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,260
When I was thinking about quitting

760
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,520
because of what he said,

761
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,330
I talked to Mr. Lee.

762
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,020
<i>And he…</i>

763
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,840
Have you heard about Ms. Sun?

764
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,060
What?

765
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,360
She told Mr. Lee she'd quit.

766
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,180
It must've been withdrawn.

767
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,350
What?

768
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:16,820
Then what about our promotions?

769
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,280
We'll have to wait longer.

770
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,490
I don't want to go to Sales Team 3.

771
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:26,980
I want to work under 
you for a long time.

772
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,740
I thought of them as family and took

773
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,600
care of their personal needs too.

774
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,000
They were only thinking 
of getting ahead.

775
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,900
They thought of my resignation

776
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,680
as an opportunity.

777
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,930
They both had high hopes.

778
00:47:54,430 --> 00:48:01,900
Since I'm sick and all, 
I don't want to do it anymore.

779
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,900
It's because they haven't worked
 under you for a year yet.

780
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,960
Mr. Oh who's working abroad always

781
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,200
complimented you as 
an old subordinate.

782
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,900
It'll be different when he comes back.

783
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,910
Just wait.

784
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,760
Hi.

785
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,320
Did you have dinner?

786
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,460
Yes.

787
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,140
I heard Ms. Sun collapsed.

788
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,770
Due to stress from overworking.

789
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,100
I see, gosh.

790
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,380
She should take care of herself.

791
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,620
You had esophagitis 
due to stress, right?

792
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,540
You suffered a lot before.

793
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,450
Yes.

794
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,080
Bye.

795
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,020
And about Geu Rae…

796
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,890
I heard there was a switch 
in the person in charge.

797
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,780
Sorry, it's the company rule.

798
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,520
I tried my best, but I couldn't help.

799
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,140
No, sir.

800
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,630
The company is tough.

801
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,100
He did so much for it.

802
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,700
So you need to be strong.

803
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,380
It's not good for the company either

804
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,000
if they keep changing contract workers.

805
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,280
You need to keep teaching them

806
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,920
from the start.

807
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,060
Let's get together for dinner sometime.

808
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,330
Ok.

809
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,660
Mr. Um.

810
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,620
Yes.

811
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,480
About the Pakistan case.
You two will continue with it, right?

812
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,210
- Anything I can do to help?
- What?

813
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,380
Sir.

814
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,760
You heard us.

815
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,120
You couldn't dissuade her?

816
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,460
Sir.

817
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,000
We're dying here.

818
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,200
<i>I thought of them as family and took</i>

819
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,640
<i>care of their personal needs too.</i>

820
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,280

<i>They both had high hopes.</i>

824
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,320
How's Ms. Sun doing?

825
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,660
She's ok.

826
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,880
We were worried.

827
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,410
- If you're done, you can leave.
- Yes.

828
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,080
I'll get going.

829
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,120
See you on Monday.

830
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,700
Bye.

831
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,290
Bye.

832
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,840
Bye-bye.

833
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,220
Bye.

834
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,660
I'll shred this before I go.

835
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,630
Ok.

836
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,230
- Geu Rae.
- Yes.

837
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,120
Did Suk Yool leave?

838
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,380
I don't think so.

839
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,100
Call him for me.

840
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,240
Hold on, Suk Yool.

841
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,450
Hi, this is Mr. Oh.

842
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:51,040
You know the cooperation request 
regarding Sales Team 1?

843
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,100
Yeah, bring that for me.

844
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,920
Bye.

845
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,340
Mr. Lee.

846
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,720
I'll go.

847
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,140
Will you stop it?

848
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,700
I said I'll go.

849
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,580
Yes.

850
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,880
Yes, sir.
See you later.

851
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,660
- Thanks.
- Sure.

852
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,760
I only have one left.
Take it, quick.

853
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,200
Come on.

854
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,670
You won't share?

855
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,040
Oh…

856
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,140
- Suk Yool.
- Yes.

857
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,820
It's Friday and you have lots of work?

858
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,840
Work?

859
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,880
No, I'm leaving now.

860
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,960
Yeah?

861
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,300
- Then have a nice Friday.
- Thanks.

862
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,790
I'll see you at King's 
Hotel tomorrow morning.

863
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,060
Excuse me?

864
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,260
What?

865
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,700
[Cooperation request regarding 
Pakistan Al Rashim]

866
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,840
You'll make the Pakistan report for me?

867
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,120
Yeah.

868
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,940
It's due on Tuesday, right?

869
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,360
I don’t know the details, 
so there will be a limit.

870
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,660
But I'll finish up to 80% by Sunday 
afternoon, and you take care the rest.

871
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,820
Mr. Oh.

872
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,620
I need some healing.

873
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,700
I have to think things through too.

874
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,720
How can you heal yourself 
by doing my work?

875
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,400
That's my style, you don't like it?

876
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,000
You'll really quit?

877
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,010
- Yes.
- Don't!

878
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,740
If you can't collect the payment, 
there are alternative ways to do so.

879
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,860
Do as much as you can.

880
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,820
That way, you won't have regrets.

881
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,960
It won't be easy by yourself.

882
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,430
Don’t worry, I won't do it alone.

883
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,660
What?

884
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,770
Here's the data, oh, and you recorded

885
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,460
the Pakistan buyer's meeting, right?

886
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,220
Of course, you did.

887
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
<i>I'm sure it was towed.</i>

888
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,860
<i>My husband couldn't bring it.</i>

889
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:12,910
Hi.

890
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,080
Young Yi.

891
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,380
Come in.

892
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,620
Hurry!

893
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,820
Geu Rae's here.

894
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,750
Hi.

895
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,180
Hurry!

896
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,130
Yes, Mr. Oh, here.

897
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,360
Mr. Oh called me.

898
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,360
I was free this weekend.

899
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,770
Mr. Oh threatened me.

900
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,080
Yes.

901
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,060
Why must I be here now?

902
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,420
I should be having a

903
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,820
date with a stewardess.

904
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,560
Geez, when would I ever have…

905
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
- Hurry up and come!
- Yes, sir.

906
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,930
The sample is here.

907
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,220
I told you to bring many.

908
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,060
Fabric, cotton cost: 2.96.

909
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,140

We're selling blankets to Pakistan?
- Yes.

913
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,420
328, so the 50,000

914
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,060
yards would be $150,000.

915
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,440
Isn't that expensive?

916
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:45,020
It sure is, but I've hidden that fabric!

917
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,300
Geu Rae.

918
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:51,710
No one took this leftover 47,928

919
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:55,480
yards which had different issues.

920
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,440
So extra funds aren't necessary.

921
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,020
$1 per each for manufacturing costs.

922
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,940
Our factory guys will

923
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,190
provide any lacking fabric.

924
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,080
Ok.

925
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,100
So now we need a manufacturing line.

926
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,900
I'll take care of that somehow.

927
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,580
Work, Geu Rae.

928
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,960
Yes.

929
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,180
Yeah.

930
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:39,860
I know it inside and out, 
and there you go again.

931
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:45,400
Still please delay those finished 
with the Malaysia case.

932
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,680
Really?

933
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,120
Thank you.

934
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,320
Thank you.

935
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,680
I have seven lines.

936
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,460
Thank you.

937
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,480
Will you do it?

938
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,140
Yes.

939
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,140
I'm a pro with recordings now.

940
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,420
What?

941
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,670
It must be English.

942
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:33,810
You're right.

943
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,600
I'll finish this first.

944
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,150
Geu Rae.

945
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,580
Ok.

946
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,520
Young Yi.

947
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,160
Hello.

948
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,500
I'm Ji Young Sun from 
One International.

949
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,810
Hello.

950
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,740
<i>Pakistan Ministry of Health…</i>

951
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,500
Pakistan Ministry of Health…

952
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,340
This is Karanshi Kibu.

953
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,950
Karanshi…

954
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,560
Karanshi…

955
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,880
- Kibu.
- Kibu.

956
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,220
- I'll tell you the spelling later.
- Ok.

957
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,120
I think we should listen to it together.

958
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,940
I don’t know English.

959
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,860
You need to know if it's a girl or guy.

960
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,760
Thank you for coming all 
the way to Pakistan.

961
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,040
Thank you…

962
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:43,140
Have some sandwiches.

963
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,580
- Have a sandwich, sir.
- Yes.

964
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,600
Shouldn't we add info about 
the long-term profits?

965
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:58,100
Oh, by focusing our benefits 
when receiving the payment?

966
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,880
Yes, just add that…

967
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,660
Your cost estimate is wrong.

968
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:05,730
Oh, you're right.

969
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:06,860
Hold on.

970
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,760
The cost and function…

971
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,440
The cost and function…

972
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,210
…should be done by Excel.

973
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,160
…should be done by Excel.

974
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,360
Ok.

975
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,660
Good.

976
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,120
He won't like a presentation 
with too much info either.

977
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,300
Right!

978
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,340
Yes.

979
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,060
Do you want some water?

980
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,790
Ok.

981
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,100
Where are you going?

982
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,480
I'll get some air.

983
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,180
I'll go with you.

984
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,770
Me too.

985
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,040
Where are you going?

986
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,860
Where are you going?

987
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,140
It's cold.

988
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,600
What's that?

989
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,640
Here!

990
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,390
Ladies first.

991
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:24,400
And then Geu Rae.

992
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,960
And Baek Ki.

993
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,300
Mr. Oh is amazing.

994
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,570
How could he do this?

995
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:34,620
We're young and we're sacrificing

996
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,900
our weekend for another team's work.

997
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,310
Are we a guerrilla army 
or human weapons here?

998
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,500
But

999
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,820
I kept thinking.

1000
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,860
If that happened to 
me later, would you all

1001
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,860
do what Mr. Oh did for her?

1002
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,220
Could you?

1003
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:11,060
I'll guess your reaction 
according to your character.

1004
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,220
Geu Rae.

1005
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:18,440
"Shouldn’t we have cup 
ramen for late nights?"

1006
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,890
"If you don’t like it, 
I'll totally change it!"

1007
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:23,980
Come on.

1008
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:24,940
"Mr. Oh."

1009
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,960
Come on.

1010
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,800
Baek Ki.

1011
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,240
"I'd like to help, but I can't move."

1012
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,130
"The basics are really important."

1013
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,200
Suk Yool.

1014
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,100
Young Yi.

1015
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,860
"I'll drive a truck if I have to!"

1016
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:47,080
"But I'll be moving like a snail!"

1017
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,300
See?

1018
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,660
Only I'd look bad.

1019
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,940
Since I won't go.

1020
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,490
Does that make sense?

1021
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,740
Talking so much made me thirsty.

1022
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:06,220
Drink mine.

1023
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,060
I'm ok.

1024
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,130
Let's go wrap up.

1025
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,560
Ok, come after you finish that.

1026
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,500
Ok, smoke.

1027
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,960
See you later.

1028
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,020
Baek Ki.

1029
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:12,680
I'm impressed.

1030
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:06,660
Come on, we didn't need Geu Rae!

1031
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,080
Alright.

1032
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,160
Thanks for the two days.

1033
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,140
I'll visit Ms. Sun at the hospital.

1034
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,500
Shall we go too?

1035
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,860
No, it'll get crowded.

1036
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,480
Go home and rest.

1037
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,360
I'll treat you to drinks.

1038
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,260
- Good day.
- Thanks!

1039
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,290
Take care.

1040
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,940
Good day.

1041
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,930
Let's go.

1042
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:30,970
Ok.

1043
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,770
Oh, no!

1044
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,400
How can you forget 
something so important?

1045
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,720
Did you forget something?

1046
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,140
Should I get Mr. Oh?

1047
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,080
All you care about is work.

1048
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,580
We have 5 hours 34 minutes 
till Sunday.

1049
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:50,880
Let's spend the next 5 
hours like it's 15 hours!

1050
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,380
Let's go this way since Mr. Oh's there.

1051
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,720
Hold on.

1052
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:05,280
<i>Remember this passionate day.</i>

1053
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,760
Let's forget about the past two days.

1054
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,090
This is no good.

1055
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,380
Work shouldn’t be like this.

1056
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,280
Why'd you sleep holding me?

1057
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,760
You got into my arms.

1058
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,280
Geez.

1059
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,580
You slept on the floor?

1060
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,000
On the bed…

1061
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,900
[Export regarding blankets 
to Pakistan Al Rashim]

1062
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,220
I can't believe this.

1063
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,510
Just thank me.

1064
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:56,000
You wouldn't let me rest 
and you want a compliment?

1065
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,900
You and I both

1066
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,140
rest by doing work.

1067
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,600
What?

1068
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,560
That sounds like a nightmare.

1069
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,360
Don’t say that, please.

1070
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,760
Gosh, our new employees 
must've worked hard.

1071
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,870
Here.

1072
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,670
Oh, my!

1073
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:26,120
It reminded me of how we worked 
on the China housing construction.

1074
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,520
The human mind is so fickle.

1075
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,480
You get ignored by team 
members you trusted,

1076
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,880
find out their thoughts,

1077
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,100
get sick,

1078
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,740
and want to drop everything.

1079
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,820
Then because of these few pages...

1080
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:58,380
Life is all about change.

1081
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:06,960
But

1082
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:10,620
what are you concerned 
about these days?

1083
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,690
What's your worry?

1084
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:16,960
What is it that you want 
to heal yourself with work?

1085
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,860
I feel stuffy.

1086
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,970
Can you get some air?

1087
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,480
Our team is like a bullet

1088
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,610
and a shield.

1089
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,480
Mr. Choi is really

1090
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,280
amazing.

1091
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,700
I hate myself for putting up with

1092
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,260
him when I know his intentions.

1093
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,480
Let me guess

1094
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,940
why you're doing this.

1095
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,400
What?

1096
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,640
You want to see who wins, right?

1097
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:11,300
You think you're at 
the point to do that.

1098
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,940
Your unscientific views.

1099
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,350
What?

1100
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:20,440
You think you're fighting 
with Mr. Choi.

1101
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,360
If you succeed with the Poshin case,

1102
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,440
he will have to acknowledge

1103
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,160
you and your team.

1104
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,180
Support is necessary since the

1105
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,620
vice president position is on the line.

1106
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,610
Aren't I right?

1107
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,010
Ok.

1108
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,060
Then how's this?

1109
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,120
One thing is for sure.

1110
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,440
With a $0.5 bil. order, promotion 
to a dept. head is possible,

1111
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,420
and after that,

1112
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,160
you get the authority 
to use whoever you want.

1113
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,480
That's the company rule.

1114
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,970
Geu Rae.

1115
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,810
You still think he can't make it?

1116
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,180
<i>Will I become a full-timer if 
I continue working like this?</i>

1117
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,680
I told him he won't.

1118
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,500
High hopes,

1119
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,020
and irresponsible consolation 
are all useless.

1120
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,660
The company is tough.

1121
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,760
So you need to be strong.

1122
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,340
<i>One thing is for sure.</i>

1123
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,920
<i>With a $0.5 bil. order, promotion 
to a dept. head is possible,</i>

1124
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,380
<i>and after that,</i>

1125
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:58,550
<i>you get the authority 
to use whoever you want.</i>

1126
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:02,200
Dong Sik was screwed.

1127
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,680
<i>When will he get promoted if the leader 
keeps bringing unprofitable work?</i>

1128
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,320
Should I wake the kids up?

1129
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,760
Oh, let them sleep.

1130
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,520
This is nice.

1131
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,660
I'll ask my mom for some 
mustard leaf kimchi.

1132
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,160
Ok.

1133
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,020
That's nice.

1134
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,200
Your mom's kimchi.

1135
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:49,200
Don't you hate me at times?

1136
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,540
Maybe you always do.

1137
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,760
It's faster to tell 
you when I adore you.

1138
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:06,160
I like it when you eat my 
food without complaining.

1139
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,460
Maybe I've changed after 
I got married.

1140
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,860
Tell me.

1141
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,830
What?

1142
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,220
You know…

1143
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,200
Can I

1144
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,880
do something for someone?

1145
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,900
Can I

1146
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,230
butt in about someone 
else's life again?

1147
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:04,840
You think it's right to

1148
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,740
help others?

1149
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,520
You can forget about it now.

1150
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,540
Let Eun Ji go now.

1151
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,980
Just bury her.

1152
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:27,890
What…

1153
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:30,360
Do it.
Just do it.

1154
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,400
Do whatever you want.

1155
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,040
You haven't done anything wrong.
That's what I think.

1156
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,330
You would do the same thing 
if you could do it all over again.

1157
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:44,100
And I think that's right.

1158
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:48,460
Come on. 
I'm not that important...

1159
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,920
Exactly.

1160
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,190
You only think about 
what you think is right.

1161
01:14:56,190 --> 01:15:00,400
Everything else doesn't 
go however you want it to.

1162
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,900
You're acting all influential.

1163
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:09,300
You think you'll just be 
able to boss people around?

1164
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:14,570
I thought you were 
saving the country or something.

1165
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,880
The soup is salty.

1166
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,720
- Don’t eat it.
- It's ok, come on.

1167
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,260
He never gets sick.

1168
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,600
He rarely catches a cold.

1169
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,740
I can't believe he took a half-day off.

1170
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,200
He's has a lot on his plate
these days.

1171
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,610
He helped with Ms. Sun's 
work on the weekend.

1172
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,620
He must've overworked himself.

1173
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,250
He'll have to make 
a decision by today.

1174
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,220
I'm worried.

1175
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:17,900
<i>You only think about 
what you think is right.</i>

1176
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,420
<i>Everything else doesn't 
go however you want it to.</i>

1177
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,920
Maybe dad didn't go to work today.

1178
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,220
Maybe he slept in.

1179
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,400
Maybe he's going in late 
since he got promoted.

1180
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,980
You can't go in late because of that.

1181
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:36,160
Maybe he'll get in trouble.

1182
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,640
Hey, kids!
You should go to school.

1183
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,840
What are you doing?

1184
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,060
Yes.

1185
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,790
- Yay!
- Bye.

1186
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,720
Bye!

1187
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,160
Come in.

1188
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:13,470
[Misaeng]

1189
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:14,540
Jang Geu Rae!

1190
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,800
<i>It's not Mr. Oh's style.</i>

1191
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,640
Then why did he accept this business?

1192
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,680
Why Sales Team 3?

1193
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,780
<i>What else?</i>

1194
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,010
<i>Switch to a full-time position?</i>

1195
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:23,510
If I can help with anything…

1196
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:25,680
I'm Young Yi's dad.

1197
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,180
Something's fishy.

1198
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,180
He got bribed.

1199
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,000
Sang Sik.

1200
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,360
If he gets promoted, he 
can become a full-timer.

1201
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,360
Mr. Oh.

1202
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,300
I'll make it happen.
