00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,740
<i>So, that's him.</i>

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,740
- Connections…
- Maybe he went to an ivy league school.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
I only have a GED.

00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,080
<i>What did you do for 26 years?</i>

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,680
<i>- You can't do anything.</i>
- Hello?

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,210
- There's a call and I can't understand.
- Huh?

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,720
Sorry, no room.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
<i>I understand you have a GED.</i>

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,550
<i>But you speak no languages,
 have no skills.</i>

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,030
- My effort is different.
- Ok, let's see how different.

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,120
<i>He works really hard.</i>

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,890
We called you.

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,890
<i>- Gone?
- They already left…</i>

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>I was abandoned because 
I didn't work hard.</i>

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,270
<i>You say I work hard?</i>

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,270
<i>No.</i>

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,310
<i>I'm out in the world because
 I didn't work hard.</i>

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,740
<i>I was abandoned because
 I didn't work hard.</i>

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,380
<i>I'm here right now because...</i>

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,580
<i>...I didn't work hard.</i>

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,770
<i>I wanted to prove...</i>

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,010
<i>...a categorization standard 
and efficient application.</i>

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,040
<i>A method to kill two birds 
with one stone.</i>

26

<i>And above all else…</i>

27
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,390
<i>…prove it to myself.</i>

28
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,600
Hello.

29
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,970
You're early today.

30
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,090
Do you know of any 
cleaners around here?

31
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,690
No.

32
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,690
You didn't go home yesterday?

33
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,290
No.

34
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,740
They're strict with 
how the interns dress.

35
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,040
Huh?

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,250
I didn't know how to tie it.

37
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,990
Give it to me.

38
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,840
- It's ok.
- Come on, I'll do it for you.

39
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,090
It's really ok.

40
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,230
What if someone sees us?

41
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,140
Shall we go to the rooftop?

45
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,740
This is amazing.

46
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,580
He spent all night on this?

47
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,380
He has integrity.

48
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,320
I'm sure that's all he has.

49
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,790
Why didn't you tell him 
what the problem was?

50
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,620
What for?
He won't be here long.

51
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,220
True.

52
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,760
I wonder how the presentation 
prep is going.

53
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,960
Who'd want to be partners with him?

54
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,200
But who got him the job?

55
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,130
Beats me.

56
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm going over to headquarters.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,500
See you later.

58
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,810
Hello.

59
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,270
- Have you…
- I saw it.

60
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,280
You've proven your 
quantity of effort.

61
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,150
Geu Rae.

62
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,360
Why'd you ignore Mr. Oh's folders?

63
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,430
No, there were many iffy 
files to put in them.

64
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,760
Geu Rae.
That's the company's manual.

65
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,000
You know what that means?

66
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,530
Everyone understood and agreed.

67
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,970
If there's an issue because of what you did...

68
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,670
...should they ask you about it?

69
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,140
You don't work alone.

70
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,610
I don't know how long
 you'll work here.

71
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,050
But keep that in mind 
while you're here.

80
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,460
Thanks to you,
 the results were great.

81
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,430
Of course, thanks.

82
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,700
Keep in touch.

83
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,740
Things going ok?

84
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,510
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,780
- What are you doing this weekend?
- Nothing much.

86
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,240
Let's go hiking with 
the executive director.

87
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,080
I forgot about
 an alumni gathering.

88
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,590
Does that mean you
 don't want to change?

89
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,220
I told you you have 
to go high to see far.

90
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,730
I told him about…

91
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,060
I'll…

92
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,630
…ask my friends to go hiking.

93
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,830
Ok.

94
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,070
Excuse me.

95
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,040
Hiking is hiking and work is work.

96
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,480
Hey!

97
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,050
What's with you when I told you 
to set the meeting ages ago?

98
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,420
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,950
You want to be fired?

100
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,520
You think we can't fire interns?

101
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,620
I'm sorry!

102
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,020
Geez!

103
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,860
Mr. Hwang, teach him well!

104
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,530
Gosh!

105
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,930
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,780
Breathe!

107
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,880
Why are you so worked up?

108
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,920
Every intern gets to you, huh?

109
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,390
Calm down.

110
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
You shouldn't have given
 him that duty.

111
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,260
He's been sitting around 
when I told...

112
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,830
...him to set the meeting 
ages ago!

113
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,330
He's thorough.

114
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,170
I guess I can't be
 as miserable as you.

115
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,240
Thanks for understanding.

116
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,440
So you heard?

117
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,180
You knew it all along?

118
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
I heard this morning.

119
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,350
What?

120
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,420
You know who his connection is?

121
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,550
What?

122
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,620
Geez.

123
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,830
Who is it?
Who got him in?

124
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,630
Who?

125
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,430
The executive director.

126
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,810
<i>Why didn't you tell him 
what the problem was?</i>

127
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,380
<i>What for?</i>

128
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,980
<i>He won't be here long.</i>

129
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,160
That was too much yesterday.

130
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,930
Something stinks.

131
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,560
It's octopus.

132
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,830
You didn't go home yesterday?

133
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,230
No.

134
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,300
Did you finish your work?

135
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,940
No.

136
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,570
You should've just gone home.

137
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,580
I have to decide on my 
presentation partner.

138
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,880
It's by tomorrow, right?

139
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,950
You'll find a partner 
for the interview.

140
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,980
Or maybe not.

141
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,860
The individual presentations 
are a bigger issue.

142
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,160
So much work.

143
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,760
I'll get going.

144
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,530
See you later, Geu Rae.

145
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,560
I'll get going too.

146
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,740
That makes me feel weird.

147
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,310
I feel I shouldn't let 
that happen to me.

148
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,020
That'll happen if we don't pass 
the final presentation interview.

149
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,670
Then what should I do?

150
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,670
What do we have to 
do to avoid that?

151
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,320
I was just kidding.

152
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,220
Being an intern at One International 
isn't everything.

153
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,550
There are tons of jobs out there.

154
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,730
Anyway you'll have 
to find a partner.

155
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,390
You can't do it by yourself.

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,470
Everyone's talking about 
'working alone' today.

157
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,500
Huh?

158
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,600
- Here.
- Ok.

159
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,770
Categorize it by the 
alphabet and nations.

160
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,440
Double-check the costs too.

161
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,840
Look, Geu Rae.

162
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,580
<i>The executive director got him in.</i>

163
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,450
He should have gotten 
someone smarter.

164
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,690
I don’t think he put him on 
your team with ulterior motives.

165
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,960
He wouldn't have done 
it to keep an eye on you.

166
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,690
What are you to him?

167
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,560
He could've done it
 to give you trouble.

168
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,730
But he's not that childish.

169
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,330
Even if he hates you.

170
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,000
Ok.

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,910
<i>I think he dumped him on your 
team since he was in a pickle.</i>

172
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,380
- Dong Sik.
- Yes.

173
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,290
Is the report ready for 
the department manager?

174
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,120
Yes.

175
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,320
- Geu Rae.
- Yes.

176
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,060
- Is it ready?
- Yes, it is.

177
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,330
He knows how to work with Excel.

178
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,600
I asked him to try checking 
by cost and nation.

179
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
What are you doing, man?

180
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,970
Huh?

181
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,470
Why'd you ask him?

182
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,270
Get your act together.

183
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,940
You asked him to try?

184
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,410
You think this is practice?

185
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,680
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,350
Finish it by 2PM.

187
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,180
Yes, sir.

188
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,330
Go for lunch.

189
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,050
Mr. Oh.

190
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,180
Is everything ok?

191
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,770
<i>You have no friends, huh?</i>

192
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,840
<i>It looks like a diary 
for yourself.</i>

193
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,080
<i>They said we don’t 
work alone.</i>

194
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,910
Why'd you ask him?

195
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,350
Get your act together.

196
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,220
<i>But they're forcing 
me to be alone.</i>

197
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,790
You asked him to try?

198
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,450
You think this is practice?

199
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,220
<i>He didn't want to 
teach me anyway.</i>

200
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,560
What do you mean, 
"You don't work alone"?

201
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,160
Huh?

202
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,300
Huh?

203
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,740
What was that?

204
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,560
There were only 
3 types for summer.

205
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,430
Yes, I didn't know
 what you wanted...

206
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,790
...so I'm bringing all of them.

207
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,370
I'm on my way up.

208
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,530
Bye.

209
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,870
Thank you.

210
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,910
Here.

211
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,810
It's ok, I'll carry it.

212
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,040
Why?

213
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,310
Huh?

214
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,810
1. Because it's heavy.
2. Because it's heavy.

215
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,180
3. Because it's heavy.

216
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,590
Did you decide on your partner?

217
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,760
Oh right, when is that due?

218
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,490
Come on, it's by tomorrow.

219
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,400
I haven't decided yet either.

220
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,730
What about the others?

221
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,870
They'll probably struggle 
not to be the odd one out.

222
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,410
I'm here now.

223
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,610
Yes.

224
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,080
To Mr. Oh?

225
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,580
Ok.

226
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,680
- Dong Sik.
- Yes.

227
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,220
Let's start with the Cambodia case.

228
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,250
Ok.

229
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,820
Sorry, but can you 
bring this to Mr. Mun?

230
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,990
Sure.

231
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,290
Yes.

232
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,100
Mr. Oh.

233
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,660
I brought the samples.

234
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,000
Thank you.

235
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,530
Did you decide on your partner?

236
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,970
Not yet.

237
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,170
I was rejected by 
Baek Ki just now.

238
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,380
I didn’t even ask, but 
he won't be my partner.

239
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,950
- He's smart.
- Huh?

240
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,520
Anyway find a good 
partner or you'll be ruined.

241
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,350
I don't care who my partner is.

242
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,750
You're that confident?

243
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,990
It's not that.

244
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,990
Prepare well and pass.

245
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,560
Thank you.

246
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,560
- They're pathetic.
- Huh?

247
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,600
Not you, the people who left this here.

248
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,340
Oh, okay.

249
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,210
<i>I don't care who my partner is.</i>

250
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,750
Young Yi.

251
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,590
Huh?

252
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,720
Be my partner.

253
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,690
Huh?

254
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,660
You said you don't care who it was.

255
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,730
I'll do my best for both of us.

256
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,000
Geu Rae?

257
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,940
Is there something on my face?

258
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,180
Huh?

259
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,850
Sorry.

260
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,690
I was thinking about something.

261
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,120
You were totally staring at me.

262
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,530
Here.

263
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,770
I forgot to give it to you.

264
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,750
Maybe I should've just asked.

265
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,290
<i>Anyway you'll have 
to find a partner.</i>

266
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,100
<i>You can't do it by yourself.</i>

267
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,870
Geu Rae.

268
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,370
I looked everywhere for you.

269
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,280
It had totally slipped my mind…

270
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,640
Have you decided on
 your partner yet?

271
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,620
Be my partner.

272
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,080
Why?

273
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,420
Let's be a good team.

274
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,320
<i>What's this?</i>

275
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,600
- Geu Rae.
- Yes.

276
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,530
Hello.

277
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,470
Here.

278
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,510
I see you skipped lunch.

279
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,350
Uh…

280
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,480
Have you decided on
 your partner yet?

281
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,520
No.

282
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,350
Ok.

283
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,560
<i>What the...?</i>

284
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,470
Give it to me.

285
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,610
It's ok…

286
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,280
Partner.

287
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,100
<i>What's all this?</i>

288
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,990
You're popular.

289
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,170
Hold on, please.

290
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,810
Yes, by the 18th.

291
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,210
Ok.

292
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,580
18th…

293
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,330
How come no one's asking?

294
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,540
Young Yi.

295
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,140
You don't have your 
partner yet, right?

296
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,510
Be my partner.

297
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm saving you.

298
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,580
No one wants to be your partner.

299
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,710
Huh?

300
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,810
Why not?

301
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,120
It's obvious.

302
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,920
You're so good.

303
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,720
Teamwork is key and you'll 
totally stand out alone.

304
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,560
I haven't decided yet either.

305
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,560
Let's do it.

306
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:21,770
[there (x), their (?)]

307
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,640
Geu Rae.

308
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,640
Young Yi.

309
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,680
Let's have a cup of coffee.

310
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,650
Partner?

311
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,690
Yes, I was too busy so
 I couldn't decide yet.

312
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,390
- But I'm…
- I have a lot to learn too.

313
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,930
Let's work hard together.

314
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,510
To... gether…

315
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,720
I have a lot to learn too.

316
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,630
Let's work hard together.

317
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,600
<i>Team?</i>

318
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,800
<i>We're a team?</i>

319
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,640
<i>Let's do it.</i>

320
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,180
Let's work hard together.

321
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,950
- Geu Rae.
- Yes.

322
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,050
Are you done proofreading?

323
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,620
Yes, I'm almost done.

324
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,250
Geu Rae.

325
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,820
Let's have a talk.

326
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,030
Sit down.

327
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,100
- Did you decide on your partner?
- Huh?

328
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,480
Why are you blushing like that?

329
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,580
Nothing.

330
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,310
Gee.

331
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,920
Everyone wants you, don't they?

332
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,820
I don't know why but…

333
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,390
You have everything the 
other interns want in a partner.

334
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,490
Huh?

335
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,960
No confidence, no comprehension 
skills or talent.

336
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,100
But why do they all want me?

337
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,640
It'd be great if both members 
of a team got good results.

338
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,140
But if it's impossible...

339
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,810
...it'd be smart to choose a loser.

340
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,550
Did you say "loser"?

341
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,780
Yes.

342
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,120
He would make the other 
person look good.

343
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,150
They'll stand out to the judges.

344
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,860
That's why they want you.

345
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,200
Be careful of who 
approaches you.

346
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,070
<i>So that was it.</i>

347
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,150
<i>Familiar places I'd visit...</i>

348
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,160
<i>...after my overnight 
part-time job.</i>

349
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,410
<i>Their faces, clothing 
and directions...</i>

350
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,080
<i>...were all the opposite of mine.</i>

351
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,350
<i>I'd never mixed with students...</i>

352
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,120
<i>...or company employees.</i>

353
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,960
<i>I wanted to be one of them
 so desperately...</i>

354
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,260
<i>...that I couldn't see 
the ugly truth.</i>

355
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,720
<i>I was still going 
the different direction.</i>

356
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,330
<i>I'm alone here too.</i>

357
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,200
<i>Only...</i>

358
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,750
<i>...I didn't know that truth...</i>

359
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,720
<i>...when everyone else did.</i>

360
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,890
<i>All this chaos in order…</i>

361
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,430
<i>I wonder…</i>

362
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,240
<i>…would it ever be possible
to have an agreement?</i>

363
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,090
<i>I have a lot to learn too.</i>

364
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,160
<i>Let's work hard together.</i>

365
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
Where are you going during work?

366
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,440
Didn't you hear me?

367
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,740
I'm alone.

368
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,170
What?

369
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,040
So there's nothing I can do.

370
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,450
What did you say?

371
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,820
You said I can't work alone.

372
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,880
I mean the company work.

373
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,960
You asked me if I had friends.

374
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,430
That it looked like
 a personal diary.

375
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,460
You were right.

376
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,530
Yes.

377
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,540
I had to do it alone.

378
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,910
I had to be fine alone.

379
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,610
And take responsibility alone.

380
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,450
- What…
- So I don't know anything but alone.

381
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,120
So…

382
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,250
…would you teach me.

383
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,990
Give me a chance.

384
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,390
You need skills for that.

385
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,230
What do you mean?

386
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,400
You know.

387
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,170
No, I don't.

388
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,770
If it's because of my educa…

389
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:52,470
Do you know how hard
 these people worked...

390
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,170
...just to get into the lobby?

391
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:03,020
All their sweat and 
tears just to stay here?

392
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,890
We're in a corrupted world 
where those...

393
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,420
...who lack the basics get 
on the escalator with lines.

394
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,090
I guess it can't be helped.

395
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,630
But…

396
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,840
…I don't support that world yet.

397
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:35,480
Sweat, tears and frustration.

398
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,140
How much more should I shed?

399
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,590
Crazy.

400
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,830
Crazy.

401
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Crazy.

402
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,910
What have I done?

403
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,930
- Mr. Kim!
- Huh?

404
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,560
You should've told 
me about the cable!

405
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,760
I was about to.

406
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,300
How come you doze 
off all the time?

407
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,640
- Mr. Kim!
- Yes.

408
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,200
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

409
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,280
Why haven't you given
 me the file I asked for?

410
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,680
I'll be done soon.

411
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,950
- Why are you so slow?
- Yes.

412
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,680
Everyone's ahead of you!

413
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,190
You started late, 
shouldn't you catch up?

414
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,790
Be on your toes.

415
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,200
You know not all
 interns will make it.

416
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,930
Yes, sir. I'll fix it.

417
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,770
Don't say that!

418
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,670
This isn't the army, or school!

419
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,300
Let's go for a smoke.

420
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,770
I quit smoking, sir!

421
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,740
Then go get some fresh air!

422
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,580
Geez!

423
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,530
I know you don't 
look for shortcuts.

424
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,290
But you need to be quick.

425
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,200
Yes.

426
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,830
- You know I support you, right?
- Yes.

427
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,300
Thank you.

428
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,500
You'll start smoking 
again in 2 years.

429
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,710
Yes.

430
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,610
Don't overreact.

431
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,080
I'm sorry.

432
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,090
It's tough to sleep
 at night, huh?

433
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,820
No.

434
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,890
Mr. Hwang.
Yeah.

435
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,300
He's here.

436
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,970
Why'd you overreact?

437
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,300
Mr. Hwang.

438
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,370
Listen carefully.

439
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,910
I have the contract 
open on my computer.

440
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,380
Delete no. 4, get the head to 
approve and bring 2 copies.

441
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,910
Yes, sir.

442
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,920
Bring the intern 
weekly report too.

443
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,520
It should be approved today.

444
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,320
Yes, sir.

445
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,400
Yes.

446
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,500
I'll have it sent right away.

447
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,140
Sorry for being late.
Bye.

448
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,540
Geu Rae.

449
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,740
Where is it?

450
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,150
These are receipts.

451
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,880
Paste them on paper and 
take it to General Affairs.

452
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,750
- Yes.
- Hurry up.

453
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,270
<i>Sorry, I'll send it soon.</i>

454
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,510
<i>Yes, thank you.
Bye.</i>

455
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,380
Hello.

456
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,610
Hi.

457
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,860
- Geu Rae.
- Huh?

458
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
What's that?

459
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,560
Huh?

460
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,160
They're scrap paper documents…

461
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,170
Don’t do that.

462
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,940
If other papers stick, 
it might cause problems.

463
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,710
I see.

464
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,910
- Don't throw it all together.
- Yes.

465
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,640
- Check if it's confidential.
- Yes.

466
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,540
- Shred them.
- Yes

467
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,910
Security is an issue these days.

468
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,990
- There was a big mistake recently.
- Yes.

469
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,120
The executive director 
yelled at the whole team.

470
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,220
Yes, sir.

471
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,940

- Yes.

475
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,350
Can I borrow the glue?

476
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,890
It's on my desk.

477
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,990
Thank you.

478
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,290
They always lock the supply cabinet.

479
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,360
So I have to beg.

480
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Over there.

481
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,760

I'm intern Kim Seok Ho.

484
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,840
I'll borrow the glue.

Give me a chance.

491
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,680
You need skills for that.

492
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,650
What do you mean?

493
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:44,050
<i>I think he dumped him on your 
team since he was in a pickle.</i>

494

00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,920
Sorry.

499
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,130
I'm sorry.

500
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,360
- I think…
- Be quiet.

501
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,940
Let's do well.

502
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,610
Yes, sir.

503
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,450
Get back to work.

Hey.

506
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,400
You…

507
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,140
Are you stupid?

508
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,140
I'm sorry.

509
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,340
I told you shred, didn't I?

510
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,750
Get out.

511
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,090
Right now!

512
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,860
You get it now?

513
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,570
Why you don't get a chance?

514
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,600
Why you're not qualified?

515
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,810
Are you still here?

516
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,450
Geu Rae.

517
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,610
Follow me.

518
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,640
Focus.

519
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,850
Hard.

523
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,670
Do two more rounds 
and come inside.

524
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,120

<i>Ok!</i>

Congratulations.

534
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:31,600

I'll borrow the glue.

540
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,110
Treat us to a drink.

Yes, let's do that!

542
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,440
Seok Ho should treat us.

543

I'll treat you to coffee.

00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,120
How about a smoke?

546
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,930
Seok Ho is a bit slowpoke...

547
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,630
...but he's meticulous.

548
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:45,570
He wrote such a good draft, the 
executive director complimented him.

549
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,430
He totally saved us.

550

He came to borrow supplies.

554
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,310
He did?

555
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,070
He keeps forgetting
 the supply key.

556
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:07,750
He works so hard, 
he won't go home.

557
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,570
When he's a newlywed.

558
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,930
Newlywed?

559
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,430
He got married early.

560
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,260
He's the head of a family.

561
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,090
Anyway…

562
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:23,250
Keep an eye out for him.

563
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,430
So that he won't make any mistakes.
He's being evaluated.

564
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,170
What mistakes?

565
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,930
He's just slow.
He doesn’t make mistakes.

566
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,390
Bye, Young Yi.

567
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,170
See you tomorrow.

568
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,570
Geu Rae?

569
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,360
Yes?

570
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,830
Have you decided on 
your partner?

571
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,170
Huh?

572
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,290
I'm intern Han Suk Yool 
in Fabric team 2.

573
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,880
I was working 
somewhere else.

574
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,070
I hurried over after I heard 
about the presentation.

575
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,590
This is so refreshing.

576
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,950
I love factories and harbors.

577
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,110
Alright.

578
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,170
Let me hear your reason.

579
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,760
Huh?

580
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,100
Why do you want me 
as your partner?

581
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:48,890
I started a week earlier 
than the other interns.

582
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,390
I majored in mechanical engineering.

583
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:55,170
And won numerous 
contest awards.

584
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,790
But I'm not interested in machines.

585
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:03,070
I actually like understanding the 
principles and conveying it to others.

586
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,490
I mean sales.

587
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,460
You know what I'm saying?

588
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,440
So…

589
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,630
…I wanted to work for
 this company.

590
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,970
And they sent me to 
the Ulsan factory.

591
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,190
Why?

592
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:25,990
Because I had already passed.

593
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,550
Yes, you're amazing.

594
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,190
I've seen complicated 
manufacturing processses.

595
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,370
I've been to interviews 
and met foreign buyers…

596
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,370
I'm not done talking.

597
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,650
Geu Rae.

598
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,190
Geu Rae!

599
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,460
[Kim Seok Ho]

600
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,460
<i>He got married early.</i>

601
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,930
<i>He's the head of a family.</i>

602
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:44,070
He lef… left?

603
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:50,990
How could he just go?

604
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,910
I was wrong.

605
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,970
Mr. Oh.

606
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,370
What are you doing?

607
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,990
Nothing.

608
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,110
Geu Rae.

609
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,470
What are you doing?

610
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:57,750
I'm sorry.

611
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,530
What are you doing?

612
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,300
- Dong Sik!
- Huh?

613
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,270
You're not done?

614
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,400
No, I'm not.

615
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,210
Let's wrap up.

616
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,010
Let's go for a drink.

617
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:13,110
Huh?
But the Vietnamese…

618
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:16,130
Hey, you don't have to 
worry about that.

619
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,910
I told you it has to be done.

620
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:21,190
Cut it out.

621
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,370
This is Oh Sang Sik.

622
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,790
Oh Sang Sik of 
One International.

623
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,790
Regarding our offer…

624
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,760
We set a date.

625
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,770
How can you keep delaying it?

626
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:34,530
Yeah.

627
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,170
Just do it!

628
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:42,550
Dang, what are you saying?

629
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,610
Do it!

630
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,010
I said, do it!

631
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,380
Do it.

632
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,610
If you don't, I'll see
 you tomorrow morning.

633
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,650
Bye.

634
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,980
- Let's go.
- Huh?

635
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,670
You come too.

636
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,020
Huh?

637
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,690
Uh…

638
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,050
What are you doing?

639
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,310
I'll do it.

640
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:41,660
Are you upset because 
the director visited?

641
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,260
No, man.
Yeah.

642
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,090
Actually right.

643
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,330
I'm upset.

644
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,570
Right, Geu Rae?

645
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,940
So funny.

646
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,880
Laugh.

647
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,310
Dong Sik.

648
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,390
Yes?

649
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,330
You know what?

650
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:10,550
The folder he organized 
was really practical.

651
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,390
Huh?

652
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:16,790
You can see the other...

653
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,230
...teams' work with his system.

654
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:25,330
You can see the whole...

655
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:29,270
...process up to approval.

656
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,280
So it's efficient.

657
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:33,330
But!

658
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,380
One thing!

659
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,820
You can't write the balance.

660
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:43,950
But!

661
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:51,950
It's good for the planning stage.

662
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:58,030
You're soooooooooooo much 
better than the others.

663
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,170
Hey.

664
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:10,150
That glue incident…

665
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:12,810
Why bring that up again?

666
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,550
He didn't make the mistake.

667
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,770
Huh?

668
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,660
He didn't do it, man.

669
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,360
There was a misunderstanding, man!

670
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:28,210
Then who did it?

671
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,590
He touched those documents.

672
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:31,790
That's…

673
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,670
…a secret.

674
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,430
Gosh.

675
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,450
Oh, man.

676
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,870
I'm sorry.

677
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,670
Are you ok?

678
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,220
Water.

679
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,810
Carry them well.

680
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,730
Mr. Oh!

681
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,530
You must've had a drink today.

682
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:04,110
Mr. Oh.

683
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:07,190
I understand it all.

684
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,850
Understand what?

685
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,030
I'm saying!

686
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,790
Yeah.

687
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:16,150
You should use your 
glue, not ours.

688
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:18,010
What's wrong with you?

689
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:22,270
You always hat it 
when I succeed.

690
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,520
He's really drunk now.

691
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,030
I got a big one, 
got a problem?

692
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,660
You feel bad?

693
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,060
Do you?

694
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,650
Huh?

695
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,430
- I'm saying!
- Yeah.

696
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,750
You're going to keep that up?
I want to make a good team.

697
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,250
What I'm saying is!

698
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,440
Give him some glue!

699
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,630
Stop talking about the supplies!

700
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:54,790
Geez!

701
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:56,830
Our kid got in trouble...

702
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,610
...because of what yours did!

703
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,590
What did my kid do?

704
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,110
Let's go for the second round.

705
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:09,630
Don't go home.

706
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,360
I'm sorry.

707
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,900
I'm sorry, Geu Rae.

708
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,770
Be alert, dude.

709
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,670
Mr. Oh, come on!

710
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,610
I'm fine.

711
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,510
Ok.

712
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,710
Come on.

713
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:24,490
Hey, kids!

714
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,490
Stop it!

715
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,840
Get out!

716
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,850
You're home?

717
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,350
Did I wake you up?

718
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,590
Sorry.

719
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,690
I barely fell asleep.

720
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:50,610
Is he sleeping?

721
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,290
No way.

722
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,490
Ok.

723
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:57,870
Here.

724
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:03,090
Hey, you.

725
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:05,670
Daddy?

726
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,410
Here.

727
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,720
Daddy?

728
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,990
The baby is awake now.

729
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,610
I'm going to sleep.

730
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,160
Sleep.

731
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:21,950
Daddy?

732
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:26,270
Daddy?

733
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,600
Daddy.

734
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:43,890
<i>Our kid got in trouble 
because of what yours did!</i>

735
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:52,790
Our kid got in trouble 
because of what yours did!

736
01:00:55,370 --> 01:01:00,050
Our kid got in trouble 
because of what yours did!

737
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:04,130
Our kid got in trouble 
because of what yours did!

738
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:10,640
Our kid got in trouble…

739
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,960
<i>He said "our kid…"</i>

740
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,070
What's wrong with you?

741
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,720
What are you doing?

742
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,520
Geu Rae.

743
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,590
[We don't work alone.]

744
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,070
<i>Geu Rae.</i>

745
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,630
<i>Geu Rae.</i>

746
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,070
Geu Rae.

747
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,410
Geu Rae.

748
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,050
Here are the files.

749
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,190
I'll see you later.

750
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,490
Geu Rae.

751
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,400
I'm going back to the site.

752
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,340
- Geu Rae…
- Let's do it.

753
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:58,270
Let's do it.
Be my partner.

754
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,570
[Misaeng]

755
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,370
<i>That loser…?</i>

756
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,710
<i>That big bluffer?</i>

757
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,270
Don't forget.

758
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:38,750
These five minutes on the 
rooftop will change your life.

759
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:41,870
I sent it since the system was revised.

760
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:44,750
I had that dish for the 
first time thanks to you…

761
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,110
Don’t you remember?

762
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,790
I remember the restaurant.

763
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,610
But he went too?

764
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,610
- OMG.
<i>- What's with…?</i>

765
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:54,390
Don't ever call me again.

766
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:55,700
Huh?

767
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,190
<i>The site you're talking about…</i>

768
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,690
<i>You're a pervert there?</i>

769
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,860
New education committee?

770
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,260
Must you do that to him?

771
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,090
Why are you asking me to do it?

772
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,080
Sir!

773
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,910
<i>Is it what the executive director wants?</i>
