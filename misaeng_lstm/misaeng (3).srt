185
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,430
Come to the lounge.

186
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,070
How to choose the resources?

187
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,110
Mm-hmm.

188
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,710
My senior works in Ulsan.

189
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,710
He got hired with this item.

190
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,250
They won't know it.

191
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,680
-We can tweak it a bit…
-Mr. Lee.

192
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,030
I have other seniors too.

193
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,710
So there are lots of material.

194
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,910
You don't have much to do at all.

195
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,890
No.

196
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,960
I like not having much to do.

197
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,750
But not old stuff.
It's no good.

198
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,500
Geez.

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,350
Why go through all the trouble?

200
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,910
You're so uptight.

201
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,230
Geez.

202
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,210
What's wrong?

203
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,520
Not feeling well?

204
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,770
No.

205
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,790
Sit down and relax.

206
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,350
You were busy running
 about today.

207
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,630
I'm good.

208
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,790
Come on.

209
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,060
It's your boss's order, not mine.

210
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,170
I met him at the 1st floor café.

211
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,290
He wants to make up for working 
you like a dog with a $4 coffee.

212
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,790
They'll tell us the 2nd presentation 
assignment the day before.

213
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,980
It'll be tough if we have lots of work.

214
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,250
I wonder how Geu Rae's doing.

215
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,930
I get Suk Yool.

216
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,790
I don't understand 
why Geu Rae chose him.

217
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,150
When he had so many choices.

218
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,170
So many choices?

219
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,200
Didn't you know?

220
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,930
They must've thought he'd 
help them stand out.

221
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,210
They wanted to use Geu Rae.

222
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,110
I must've thought that too.

223
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,450
7.6%...

224
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,220
-The copies.
-Hand them out.

225
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,250
-Sure.
-The overseas market is 2.9%.

226
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,290
<i>Geu Rae.</i>

227
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,050
<i>Work harder.</i>

228
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,650
<i>Let's do it.</i>

229
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,730
Young Yi.

230
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,800
See you tomorrow.

231
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,630
What's a container crane?

232
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:41,110
Container handling gantry 
crane or ship-to-shore…

233
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,150
Telegraphic transfer?

234
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,550
Exchange rate when electronic
 means of transferring funds overseas.

235
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,610
We just need to make 
the orders to Ulsan.

236
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,110
I'm surprised the manager approved it.

237
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,890
I wonder if the executive 
director said anything.

238
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,010
Make sure not to make any mistakes.
So they can't pick on you.

239
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,130
There won't any problems 
since we've been on this.

240
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,450
We're just tight on time.

241
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,490
-Geu Rae.
-Yes.

242
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,710
Check the Vietnamese case info.

243
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,590
The loading, discharging
 rates and DF…

244
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,000
That won't be in the dictionary.

245
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,840
-We use that term here.
-I know.

246
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,110
Aren't you talking about
 dispatch fees?

247
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,010
The fee that ships pay for putting it there 
when they can't load and unload.

248
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,170
Can I check after 
I make these copies?

249
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,270
Huh?
Go ahead.

250
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,890
Thank you.

251
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,070
Did you tell him?

252
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,330
No.

253
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,170
Maybe he's a genius.

254
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,700
He memorized
 the dictionary in 3 days.

255
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,170
Look at him prepare the 
presentation item too.

256
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,350
Oh, my gosh.

257
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,490
Although he might not 
know what he's doing.

258
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,740
Yeah, that's important.

259
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,430
I wonder if he knows 
what he's doing.

260
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,250
Mr. Oh.

261
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,970
Do you honestly want 
him to make it or not?

262
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,910
Want my honest opinion?

263
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,090
Why get so serious?

264
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,210
I honestly want him to fail.

265
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,430
Huh?

266
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,620
<i>Again…</i>

267
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,170
<i>What is it this time?</i>

268
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,030
<i>It's not sexy.</i>

269
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,610
<i>Do it again with something 
else that's sexy.</i>

270
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,650
Geez.

271
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,050
Hi, Geu Rae.

272
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,750
Why this time?

273
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,990
Didn't you get my text?

274
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,990
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

275
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,110
You don’t get me.

276
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,350
Things have changed.

277
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,710
"Sexy" doesn't only 
refer to sexual appeal.

278
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,110
Something…

279
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,270
…with an edge.

280
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,010
You probably don’t get that either.

281
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,850
Good partners would get 
each other right away.

282
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,050
<i>You're inflexible and conservative,
 aren't you?</i>

283
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,990
<i>You must not be able to adjust 
to fast changing trend quickly.</i>

284
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,040
That's not the issue.

285
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,210
It's not?

286
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,090
Then what's the problem?

287
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,970
That?

288
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,050
Geu Rae.

289
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,990
That's no good for the item.

290
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,450
I've won many awards…

291
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,050
Didn't you say I could 
do whatever I want?

292
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,050
I asked you to share it.

293
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,490
I said I'd do my share.

294
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,290
So I have to do 
whatever you ask me?

295
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,570
Geu Rae.
I know what I'm doing.

296
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,790
Also, I'm what the company needs.

297
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,050
Who do you think 
should listen to who?

298
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,410
I'm not saying I'm 
better than you.

299
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,610
I'm giving you good advice.

300
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,930
Then…

301
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,650
…what kind of item should it be?

302
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,150
You find it.
Something you're good at.

303
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,550
And something sexy.

304
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,410
I'm in Seoul for work.
Shall I go in?

305
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,190
No, it's ok.

306
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,490
Ok, call me when you're ready.

307
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,090
<i>Unsexy = Tooooo plain.</i>

308
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,310
Why, that…

309
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,820
That bomb exploded first.

310
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,060
Hello.

311
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,870
Hi.

312
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,950
How are things going?

313
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,310
Not so smooth.

314
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,310
Yes, right.

315
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,210
Sorry I'm late.

316
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,950
Hi.
Our material overlaps.

317
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,950
Let's talk outside.
Come on.

318
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,350
Hello.

319
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,270
You're really quitting?

320
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,640
You've worked so hard.

321
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,390
Try one more time.

322
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,670
You always make it happen.

323
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,880
Yeah, man.

324
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,590
Even we made it too.

325
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,370
You were better than us.

326
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,210
You sure you won't regret it?

327
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,130
What's all that mess for?

328
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,710
He didn't even sleep 
over the weekend.

329
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,710
That's the only place 
for veggie wraps.

330
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,970
It's gross.

331
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,510
They're good for you though.

332
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,270
He's sleeping.

333
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,590
-Should I wake him up?
-Nope.

334
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,030
He has tons of presentation 
items on his desk.

335
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,050
He's preparing alone?
Who's his partner?

336
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,570
The guy in Ulsan, Suk Yool.

337
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,790
The slacker?

338
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,470
You know how he is.

339
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,910
Looks like Geu Rae is 
doing all of the work.

340
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,870
So the slacker and
 clueless guy met.

341
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,870
True.

We need to hurry 
and decide on the item.

366
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,810
Ok, ok.

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,730

368

I'm sorry!

369
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,050
Sorry.

370
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,770
Call from the headquarters.

371
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,000
Never mind.

372
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,750

<i>Let's postpone our evening 
meeting to tomorrow.</i>

-<i>I'll bring a lot of materials.</i>

[Vietnamese fiber…]

384
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,150
They're not cutting us any 
slack for the presentation.

385
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,830
They want us to pull it all off.

386
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,470
Same with your team?

387
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,060
Yes.

388
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,170
My partner is giving me trouble too.

389
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,130
Huh?

390
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,130
You saw how stubborn 
he was last time.

391
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,940
I thought I'd just have
 to do my part…

392
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,190
…whoever became my partner.

393
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,550
I preferred someone 
I could communicate with.

394
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,750
I just wanted to let you know.

395
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,850
I didn't have ulterior 
motives in mind that you think.

396
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,860
-I'm sorry.
-No.

397
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,470
No need to apologize.

398
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,770
You can do that after you pass.

399
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,750
Anything fun to share?

400
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,150
-Yes.
-Yes?

401
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,260
You shouldn't be
 sitting here now.

402
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,430
Your team seems to
 have an issue.

403
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,590
Huh?

404
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,350
Yes.

405
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,790
I'm sorry.

406
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,300
That was just a verbal contract…

407
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,440
But…

408
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,010
Yes.

409
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,410
Yes, sir.

410
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,970
I'll try to find a solution.

411
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,450
Yes.
Bye.

412
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,450
-Mr. Oh.
-What's wrong with you?

413
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,510
-I'm sorry.
-I told you to check it a million times!

414
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,970
I'm sorry.

415
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,090
Never mind.

416
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,300
I approved it, so it's 
my responsibility.

417
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,190
No, I…

418
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,390
Follow me.

419
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,530
You never make mistakes.

420
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,530
I know you had a lot 
on your plate. But...

421
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,110
…I told you many times.

422
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,370
You and I are on this project, 
so we need to do well.

423
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,300
Actually, I should've 
checked the FTA conditions.

424
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,010
-Seok Ho.
-Yes.

425
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,430
Do you know what's 
going on in my team?

426
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,630
It is a big mess.

427
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,150
Mr. Kim's fine fiber 
duster export case.

428
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,810
The buyer asked them to meet 
the FTA conditions now.

429
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,330
They just mentioned it during the...

430
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,290
...verbal contract and 
Mr. Kim missed it.

431
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:59,010
He didn't think too much about it 
as it was before FTA took effect.

432
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,770
As far as I know, the 
ship leaves tomorrow.

433
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,570
Exactly.
But they won't budge.

434
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,030
They'll annul the contract if it's not...

435
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,510
...fulfilled within the appointed date.

436
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:26,010
If we make cancellations and rebook, 
can we make the contract date?

437
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,170
Rebook?

438
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,830
Then the ship…

439
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,830
We have ships with
 quick arrival times.

440
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,870
After all procedures and if we're 
lucky to get a quick ship…

441
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,370
Get a ship first.

442
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,850
Or even air transport.

443
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,630
Then the cost will…

444
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,130
Hey!

445
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,790
That's not the issue here.

446
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,810
Yes.

00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,150
<i>Come in.</i>

448
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,330
I'll get it fixed within 3 days.

449
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:12,200
With the air fee, storage and 
booking cancellation charge…

450
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,010
What will you do about the cost?

451
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,950
Preventing the contract annulment 
is the priority here.

452
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,410
For trust in the future.

453
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,700
You're aware of that and 
you created this mess?

454
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,890
Thank you.

455
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,810

-Ok.

457
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,520
Get the documents on the way.

458
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,830
I got the containers put in storage.

459
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,250
If we go now, which one can we catch?
-That…

460
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,960

earliest is an hour later.

 Indonesia, and Taiwan.

474
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,990
We need to make all the documents.

475
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,530
It'll be more complicated 
than we think.

476
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,110
Are the Chinese documents ready?

477
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,920
They must be there somewhere.

478
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,520
We'll have to search.

479
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,210
I think I'll have to check the storage 
and look at the documents myself.

-Ok.

00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,560
You're so weird.

548
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,470
How's the presentation 
coming along?

549
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,650
Huh?

550
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,970
Why?

551
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,450
You never asked me before.

552
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,930
-Our presentation preparations…
-Alright.

553
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,310
Fax.

554
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,710
Yeah.

555
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,610
It came.

556
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,350
We just need to send it to the 
company with the number now.

557
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,630
<i>Then I'll go to Seoul 
and prepare the rest.</i>

558
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,150
See you in Seoul.

559
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,970
Did it go well?

560
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:53,910
-Geu Rae.
-Yes?

561
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:53,910
[Geu Rae: "Yes" in Korean]

562
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,350
What's wrong with you?

563
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,920
<i>Let's talk.</i>

564
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,990
I have a question.

565
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,990
Have you been 
conned before?

566
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,370
What?

567
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,200
They're not helpful at all.

568
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,570
Saps morale…

569
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,000
Are you talking about yourself?

570
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,430
About Suk Yool…

571
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,590
His motives are strong.

572
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,700
If you're incompetent, 
he'll look good.

573
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,000
Even if you're competent, 
he'll use that…

574
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,310
…to look good.

575
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,940
I see.

576
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,530
His motives are like a tornado.

577
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,380
He gives others damage
 or trouble.

578
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,790
The center is calm though.

579
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,150
Aim for the center.

580
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,010
Did you see them?

581
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,310
I heard you're here with Mr. Oh
 because of a team mistake.

582
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,310
How are the items?

583
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,770
This is all I did.
There's so much to do.

584
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,840
What did you think?

585
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,490
Well…

586
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,730
Again?

587
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,150
Let's go with the second item.

588
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,610
Are you sure?

589
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,030
Yes, but…

590
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,250
Then that's it.

591
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,090
Huh?

592
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,770
We decided on the item together.

593
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,670
You're experienced and 
you shouldn't...

594
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,370
...suffer any loses because of me.

595
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,460
You agreed on the 
item, so we're set.

596
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,360
Huh?

597
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,510
I'll create the presentation details.

598
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,090
So it's beneficial for me.

599
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,150
I'll share the data, but 
I won't accept support.

600
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,650
As promised.

601
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,740
Huh?

602
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,090
<i>The world of go is always a war.</i>

603

<i>…or try to survive together.</i>

606
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,750
<i>But the winner
 and loser are clear.</i>

607
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,490
How old are you?

608
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:24,930
Huh?

609
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,430
<i>I lived in that world
 for over a decade.</i>

610
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,870
<i>Over the years…</i>

611
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,530
<i>…my focus on winning
 has grown even I'm a loser now.</i>

612
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,770

the team's mistake.</i>

615
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,050
<i>The certificate of origin was sent 
in time and the forwarding agent…</i>

616
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:52,830
<i>A forwarding agent is a company that 
organizes shipments for others.</i>

617
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,390
<i>According to the trade term dictionary.</i>

618
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,530
<i>It was sent to the forwarding agent.</i>

619
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,570
<i>And a ship was successfully 
sent off in Ulsan.</i>

620
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,200

625
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,130
I know.

626
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,350
Just because there were
 some extra fees?

627
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,210
What's going on?

628
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,480
I know.

629
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,510
It doesn't usually happen.

630
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,920
If it happens, he'll 
probably get demoted.

631
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,110
Must you do this to the young kid?

632
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,410
So why redo the item the 
executive director rejected?

633
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,670
So it was the executive 
director's idea?

634
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,990
He had his reasons 
for rejecting it.

635
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,810
You were playing smart about it.

636
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:36,390
When you redid it, you were telling 
him you were risking your everything.

637
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,850
-Sir!
-You should've done well in the first place!

638

-Geu Rae.
-Yes.

00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,310

653
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,980

<i>He's great at guessing too.</i>

655
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,190
I didn't guess.

Change the title.

662
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,470
People need different things 
depending on the culture.

663
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,470
-Culture…
-Wait.

664
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,990
What does "mentality 
trapped in culture" mean?

665
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,990
I just happened to write that…

666
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,430
Geu Rae.

667
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,930
You don't think of our presentation 
as a primary school essay, do you?

668
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:10,150
These incomprehensible sentences 
will just do us harm.

669
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:15,770
If you had to interpret it…

670
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,270
For example…

671
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,870
"Would chicks in hot 
countries like cosmetics?"

672
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,850
"Of course not, and they 
don’t sell well."

673
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:27,370
That's what you meant by 
"mentality trapped in culture"?

674
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,090
Then think about this.

675
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,850
There's BP fiber.

676
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,310
It has low durability and 
thermal resistance...

677
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,810
...so it's bad for regular clothing.

678
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,360
So should we throw it out?

679
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,730
Think!

680
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,290
Have you done some thinking?

681
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,200
Yes.

682
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,370
This fiber has low 
thermal conductivity.

683
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,190
-What's that?
-It's…

684
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,270
That's it!
It doesn’t absorb moisture.

685
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,490
What's that?

686
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,890
Fast dry! Will you concentrate?

687
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:06,890
We can sell it in cold countries, 
but what about other issues…

688
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:13,090
This is why you need me.

689
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,670
The power of experience.

690
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:19,390
I'd sell long johns in cold countries.

691
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,100
To people trapped in the 
culture of the cold climate.

692
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:27,990
I caught that, but you wrote 
it without any thought.

693
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,400
That's being "trapped in culture."

694
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,370
What do you think?

695
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,580
You can just trust me, ok?

696
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,650
I'd sell long johns in 
cold countries.

697
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,270
To people trapped in the 
culture of the cold climate.

698
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,870

699

701
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,180

Mr. Kim is competent.

703
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,190
You know that, sir.

704
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,630
I'm responsible for
 what happened.

705
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,670
It was just a mistake…

706
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,930
Yes, sir.
Yes.

707
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:34,230
Please do what you can, sir.

708
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,390

713
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,390

…to the executive director.

715
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,710

716
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,270
What?

717
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:12,430
What do you mean, what?

718
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,990
Why don't you take
 the shortcut?

719
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,070
You know all he has to do...

720
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,250
...is put in a word.

721
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,270
-Mr. Ko!
-The executive director…

722
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,570
Yeah, I know things aren't 
cool between you two.

723
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,590
You need to swallow 
your pride this time.

725
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,920
Ok, forget it, don't go.

726
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,390
Dong Sik will just get a pay cut…

727
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,890
…and sent to the factory.

728
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,550
He'll just have to 
sacrifice a promotion.

729
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:50,430
Yeah, your pride is more important 
than your subordinate.

730
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:54,310
I'll be the only one who knows 
you didn't do your best.

731
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,250
Why should I care 
about your team?

732
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:00,170
What a pain in the neck.

733
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:32,670
<i>You know all he has to 
do is put in a word.</i>

734
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,810
<i>Yeah, I know things aren't 
cool between you two.</i>

735
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,310
<i>You need to swallow 
your pride this time.</i>

737
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,130
Did Mr. Oh come back?

738
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,330
He said he'd return soon.

739
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,550
Yeah?

740
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,210
Then I'll go to KOTRA.

741
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:02,570
Ok.

742
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,750

743
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,310

-Bye.

It's tomorrow finally.

749
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,900
Thank you.

750
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,530
I thought about it.

751
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:11,470
Let's wrap it up in a sexier way.

752
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,880
Let's end it with a question.

753
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,210
Huh?

754
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,230
What?

755
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,550
You don't understand?

756
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:21,690
I said "sexy" means "uncommon."

757
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,370
Not something 
everyone else does.

758
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:27,790
We should end it with 
a meaningful question.

759
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,850
An interview should convey…

760
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:36,470
That's what I'm saying.

761
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:40,650
You can infer his opinion 
through the question.

762
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,170
So frustrating.

763
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,850
Let's think about the question.

764
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,110
Refer to some books.

765
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,850
Sure.

766
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,450
Ask me questions if any.

767
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,930
Sure.

768
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,290
If you still need…

769
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:02,430
Geu Rae.

770
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,590
Mr. Oh.

771
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:05,730
Hello.

772
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,450
I didn't get the meeting briefing.

773
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,670
Huh?

774
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,840
I'll submit it soon.

775
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,380
Soon?

776
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,690
How many times did 
I tell you not to...

777
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,250
...let the presentation 
disturb your work?

778
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,990
I'm sorry.

779
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,610
You getting disregarded 
looks natural.

780
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,070
Why just say "sure, 
sure" like that?

781
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,420
Are you dumb or do 
you lack will power?

782
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:45,490
You told me to get into 
the center of the tornado.

783
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,530
Because the center is calm.

784
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:54,570
I could suffer damage 
next to him.

785
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:59,400
Didn't you mean I should get 
inside if I can't move far away?

786
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,030
Although he makes me mad...

787
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,870
...I realized I need him.

788
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,190
I have to acknowledge him.

789
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,770
It's something I can't 
overlook with pride.

790
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,370
I'm sure of that.

791
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,250
I'm ashamed...

792
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,500
...but I have to survive for now.

-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

798

See you, sir.

799
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,250
Oh, are you ok?

800
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,370
You should watch 
where you're going.

801
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,470
Your lower body is weak, huh?

802
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,110
Lower body…

803
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,210
That's important for men.

804

807
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,070
Yes?

808
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,670
You dropped one.

809
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,190
I'm sorry.

810
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,950
Did you practice reading it?

811
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,010
Huh?

812
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:30,330
Practice it like you're 
making an announcement.

813
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,340
It's different from just 
reading it to yourself.

814
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:39,130
When you're nervous, 
your breathing shakes.

815
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,790
If you speak louder for others…

816
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,750
…you'll be out of breath.

817
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,750
Don't just rely on the mic.

Listen to your tense

That'll make you even 
more nervous.

821

it would be good too.

 it out loud?

 time ourselves.

So?

if it's too long?
