186
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,810
It was the only one 
available, so Gi Suk did it.

187
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,030
-But Hyun Wu? 
-I'm sorry about that.

188
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,090
Next.

189
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,860
-But he?
-Next.

190
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,930
Myanmar is in a location 
connecting China and India.

191
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,930
Ever since 2011, they've 
been developing gradually.

192
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:49,210
But crises can be 
categorized into risks?

193
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,510
Do you even know you're 
mixing risk and crisis?

194
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,610
Risk is the danger of loss.

195
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,610
Crisis is?.

196
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,980
Team 3's strategy is to secure the value chain
through feed grains business for resources.

197
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,950
We participate productions 
and secure procurement channels.

198
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,080
Our goal is to become a lead
trader in food resources.

199
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,830
It's nice...

200
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,330
...but you'll be more 
suited for an ad company?

201
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,710
Yes, I too think?

202
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:30,450
This center is expected to
 lead the steel industry ...

203
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,570
...and the center of Ukraine's strategic 
business and Eastern Europe.

204
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,590
Ok.

205
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,460
How did you end up 
applying for our company?

206
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,890
I was interested in trade.

207
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,190
You worked for
 a trading company before.

208
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,370
Uh?

209
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,780
?I went to community college.

210
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,830
So I thought it wouldn't
 be competitive.

211
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,390
So you thought you could make it 
here with your background.

212
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,950
You went to community college, but 
your GPA is good and you have talent.

213
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,230
How can you be so unconfident?

214
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,250
You want us to accept you or not?

215
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,230
I'm sorry.

216
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,810
Sorry about what?

217
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,140
Gosh.

218
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,510
Let me correct it.

219
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,530
I never disregarded
 this company.

220
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,130
That doesn't work.

221
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,510
Thinking that being honest
 will show the sincerity.

222
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,960
People can become honest 
to give some excuses.

223
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,850
Regardless of the truth.

224
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,160
Next.

225
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,890
Regarding the development 
of solar energy...

226
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,130
...the costs haven't decreased.

227
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:59,710
According to simulation results
when we build 50k watt...

228
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,440
-Are you sick?
-Don't talk to me.

229
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,510
What's wrong?
Will you be able to speak?

230
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,750
-Then we need to?
-I didn't say I couldn't.

231
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,170
Next, Ahn Young Yi and
 Lee Sang Hyun.

232
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,450
Come on out.

233
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,700
Hello.

234
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,510
I'll be giving a presentation on 
India's solar energy IPP business plan.

235
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,350
I think we should expand value chains 
through networks and investments...

236
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,980
...and present plans to develop 
independent power producers.

237
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,250
So I'd like to present ways to
 enhance and specialize IPP.

238
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,980
There are 3 ways to enhance IPP.

239
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,580
If we acquire solar energy 
providing networks...

240
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,500
...it will naturally bring higher value.

241
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,410
It will lead to better trading values.

242
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,570
We can reinforce the EPC and smart...

243
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,580
...manufacturing development
 and create synergy.

244
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:20,680
You must be wondering 
why solar energy.

245
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,990
This graph will explain that.

246
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,190
She's really good.

247
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,910
The solar energy?

248
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,070
How can you secure 
materials in India?

249
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,090
Through materials such 
as ingot and wafer...

250
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,430
...a value chain will be secured.

251
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,980
What about developing countries?

252
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,380
Polysilicone manufacturers?

253
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,950
Everything is going smooth for her.

254
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,090
She's so solid about her opinion.

255
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,560
She has guts.

256
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,590
Seok Ho was good too.

257
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,630
What about module 
manufacturers' M&A?

258
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,630
She's shady.

259
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,910
Huh?

260
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,570
She's very shady.

261
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,070
So module manufacturers' M&A?

262
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,730
?through previous referrals?

263
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,450
?references to?

264
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,580
?developed countries?

265
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,420
What are previous references?

266
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:39,750
Belgium or Japan?

267
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,600
Yes, I'll tell you.

268
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,270
So module manufacturers' M&A?

269
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:51,550
...and previous references to 
work with developed countries.

270
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,270
I'll explain briefly.

271
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,390
He's making her look good now.

272
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,750
Solar energy attracts many
 attentions in the country...

273
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,710
...and the company, Infinity, also has
 hundreds of plants in the Philippines

274
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,150
He looks comfortable 
since he gave up.

275
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,790
We analyzed the ranking index
based on One International's values...

276
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,630
...and we found out we need to?

277
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,290
?develop businesses and...

278
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:26,390
?be flexible to changes 
and be creative.

279
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,850
So we need to look at IBM's flexible 
new business strategy.

280
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:38,280
They have a radical system, Crossnext,
 for direct management and affiliates.

281
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,080
This innovative idea's focus is 
on the process, not the actual profits.

282
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,310
He shows presentations textbook.

283
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,070
His words are so clear.

284
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,530
Very logical.

285
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,910
He's good...

286
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,810
...but he's only moving his brains.

287
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,270
He needs to move people's hearts to sell.

288
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,370
That's my presentation regarding...

289
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,690
...One International's future.

290
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,110
Thank you.

291
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,270
I wonder how the test is going.

292
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,370
Gosh.

293
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,870
He won't be shaking.

294
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,310
He's used to it.

295
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,550
It's nothing for him.

296
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,590
Next, Jang Geu Rae 
and Han Suk Yool.

297
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,010
Jang Geu Rae's in your team?

298
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,390
Yes.

299
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,310
Don?t touch me.

300
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,810
Suk Yool.

301
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,070
Our presentation will be about...

302
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,330
..."trade trapped in culture..."

303
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,990
It's about profit-generating strategies 
through countermining that.

304
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,040
Geu Rae.

305
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,030
What's with him?

306
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,250
He must be very nervous.

307
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,190
So our start is?

308
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,590
Hello?

309
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,590
Suk Yool?

310
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,230
He's not here now.

311
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,870
He's taking his intern test.

312
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,610
He's not here now.

313
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,510
Why's everyone looking for him?

314
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,410
Did you take your medication?

315
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,670
What are you doing?

316
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,370
Breathe.

317
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,850
You look sick.

318
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,090
Look up.

319
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,910
Don't sound like you're reading it.

320
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,940
That's how we decided 
on our topic.

321
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,290
-Hey.
-Huh?

322
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,870
Breathe.

323
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,310
Where's the fire?

324
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,350
Uh?

325
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,490
I'm sorry.

326
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,790
I need more time.

327
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,270
I'll go take my medication 
to calm myself.

328
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,500
Please.

329
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,930
Go take it...

330
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,470
...but I can't give you more time.

331
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,570
The others won't want that.

332
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,750
You have 7 more minutes left.

333
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,150
I'll just?

334
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,570
I'll do it.

335
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,110
I'll do it.

336
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,580
Why, that?

337
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,490
Explain it.

338
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,230
Why did you put that there?

339
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,070
Just because?

340
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,530
There's no such thing 
as "just because."

341
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,510
You need a plan for every move.

342
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,080
That's called an intention.

343
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,080
Your top-right is blocked.

344
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,310
What will you do about the crisis?

345
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,380
Get rid of unnecessary ones.

346
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,510
Get rid of what?

347
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,980
Eloquence.

348
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,560
I'll get rid of the reason 
why I chose Suk Yool.

349
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,430
Being trapped in culture?

350
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,510
?means you're trapped on?

351
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:47,370
?in the customs, locations.

352
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:53,530
That's the limitation.

353
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,990
Why's he stammering?

354
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,150
Limitations of environment?

355
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,170
Come on.

356
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,170
He won't make it.

357
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,090
Limitational?

358
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,890
?limitations?

359
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,490
This isn't working.

360
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,550
I need more than ambition.

361
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,170
Geez.

362
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,810
Dad!

363
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,930
Suk Yool!

364
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,390
Are you going to the factory?

365
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,570
Yeah, I'm starting the night shift.

366
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,690
Your hands are black.

367
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,930
It's heavy grease.

368
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,250
Why? 
 Are you embarrassed?

369
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,090
No, I'm not embarrassed of you.

370
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,290
My boy!

371
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,910
Bye.

372
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,940
You didn't hear the condition?

373
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,070
The whole labor union 
will be laid off.

374
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,010
Suk Yool!

375
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,030
My dad went to his office.

376
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,270
Your dad is home, huh?

377
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,590
You must be embarrassed.

378
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,370
No, I'm not embarrassed.

379
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,090
You must be embarrassed.

380
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,590
Geez.

381
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,300
Not making them want it is?

382
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,990
?but making need it is our goal.

383
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:36,480
So that is limitation...
so environment limits...

384
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,720
He's probably taking his intern test.

385
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,010
He won't pick up.

386
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,330
Yeah, he's taking his intern test.

387
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,030
I called too.

388
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,570
He won't pick up.

389
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,490
When does his test end?

390
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,730
-He'll get an office job finally.
-He'll do good.

391
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,810
We should help him leave the site.

392
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,010
He has stage fright.

393
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,370
He took his medication?

394
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,630
There are no?

395
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,450
?not many people?

396
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,050
?in that region?

397
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,170
?so containers aren't filled?

398
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,660
-?full?
-Wait.

399
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,530
It's all good, but hard to listen to.

400
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,430
You need to use more
 formal terms.

401
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,000
Not personal ones.

402
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,290
Don't you think it's no good?

403
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,170
Yeah?
I'm sorry.

404
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,510
Have you been to the site?

405
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,030
You need some creative 
input about the products.

406
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,970
You haven't gone to 
the site, did you?

407
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,810
No.

408
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,650
Interns these days know nothing.

409
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,110
You won't ask for a tour.

410
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,110
You won't go if your
 boss doesn't.

411
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,890
Indeed?

412
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,470
?the site is important.

413
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,510
Thanks.

414
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,250
Sorry for the trouble.

415
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,720
I'll continue.

416
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,120
Dad, I'm not ashamed of you?

417
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,530
?or the site.

418
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,530
You need to check cases 
where FCL doesn't work.

419
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,750
Fulfilling conditions with 
forwarding agents are key.

420
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,290
LCL or air transport is possible.

421
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:51,730
You can send a small quantity to 
the consumer directly that way.

422
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,810
When people die in Northern Russian...

423
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,930
It was Suk Yool's time.

424
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,210
His presentation was smooth 
and flawless with terms used on sites.

425
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:13,080
The executives from the 
site looked impressed.

426
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,050
Will ancients be able to come?

427
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,840
He was making up for the time 
he lost with his eloquence.

428
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:28,130
He took control.

429
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,280
He knew what he was doing.

430
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,410
He took full control. That's it.

431
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,680
Let me conclude.

432
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:45,830
Now he had become 
a male Young Yi.

433
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,740
He changed into a pro from
 a conman in 3 minutes.

434
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,690
Good job.

435
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,010
Gosh.

436
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,030
It was so tough.

437
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,090
The executive director 
was so intimidating.

438
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,390
Wasn't Young Yi amazing?

439
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,910
Gosh.

440
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,570
Young Yi!

441
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,220
Don't you want coffee?
Young Yi!

442
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,760
He needs to sell.

443
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,650
Baek Ki was great.

444
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,450
I think Young Yi was 
best after Seok Ho.

445
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,270
Wasn't Young Yi amazing?

446
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,590
Don't let them hear you.

447
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,950
Anyway she's a girl...

448
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,180
Suk Yool was good.

449
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,030
Young Yi was like a pro.

450
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,170
I liked Geu Rae's paper 
and presentation.

451
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,110
Too bad.

452
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,750
It was a good chance.

453
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,330
That's his limit.

454
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,870
It's a miracle he came here.

455
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,710
I liked how he didn't go on.

456
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,150
You're saying that 
on purpose.

457
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,090
Don't do that.

458
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,710
Ultimately?

459
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,270
?it'll harm you.

460
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,990
What are you saying?

461
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,750
We think our past is 
holding onto us...

462
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,330
...but it's the other way around.

463
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,990
That's how you look now.

464
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,210
Why, you?

465
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,910
Why should a married woman 
look at a married man?

466
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:46,830
Don't look down on me just because 
you got promoted earlier.

467
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,450
You still think you're a hottie.

468
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,590
Yeah.

469
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,200
How was Geu Rae?

470
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,750
No way.

471
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,230
He was a moron.

472
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,200
Huh?

473
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,830
I knew Young Yi was a pro.

474
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,530
Mr. Oh, come on.

475
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,990
I'll go to Ijin Chemicals.

476
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,480
Ok!

477
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,710
Trip him if you can't make it.

478
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,700
Huh?

479
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,670
You'll at least get 
the pleasure of seeing him trip.

480
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,840
Huh?

481
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,810
The second presentation 
interview will start.

482
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,890
As we've told you...

483
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,650
...you'll have to sell to 
your partner, and why?

484
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,610
That will be fun, won't it?

485
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:03,550
If you reject without a good reason,
 your score will be deducted.

486
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,560
I bought this for 
$600 in Hong Kong.

487
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,830
I'll sell it to you for $350.

488
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,730
I won't buy it.

489
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,610
That's no good reason.

490
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:19,110
This belt is Korean but 
a great imitation?

491
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,350
You love name brands.

492
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,030
You need a wallet?

493
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,170
I think Korean product 
quality is better.

494
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,490
You like foreign name brands.

495
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,570
You bragged about buying 
nice used items.

496
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,570
What's with him?

497
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,770
Used items is discovering 
resources too.

498
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,910
You're talented, Jong Min.

499
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,760
You're also diligent...

500
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,400
...but you lack confidence.

501
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,770
That's because you don't 
have anything original.

502
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,490
You're the brand, Jong Min.

503
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,140
Don't imitate others.

504
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,710
Buy this mirror to build?

505
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,750
?you own originality.

506
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,290
I don't imitate others.

507
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,490
What's that?

508
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,590
The item I'll try to 
sell you is invaluable.

509
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,830
You can give me however 
much you want.

510
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,270
I'll sell an exclusive...

511
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,370
...memory for Young Yi.

512
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,470
This is a day in One International...

513
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,790
...intern Ahn Young Yi's life.

514
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,350
[A day in Young Yi's life]

515
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,900
[Ah]

516
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,030
Gosh.

517
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,120
[Silence, Intern presentation test]

518
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,350
Jang Geu Rae and Han Suk Yool,
 please prepare.

519
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,250
Go ahead.

520
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,090
Han Suk Yool will start.

521
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,410
This is what I'll sell
 to Jang Geu Rae.

522
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,090
Here.

523
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:00,260
These are the fabrics 
we're making in Ulsan.

524
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,490
These are various 
synthetic fibers in...

525
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:08,290
...including nylon 
and polypropylene.

526
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,710
They are creating high value...

527
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,740
...in the 21st century.

528
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,270
One more thing.

529
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,890
This is a book of 
work environments?

530
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,090
...losses due to mistakes in orders?

531
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,380
?and analysis of miscommunication.

532
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,310
I'll sell this site info to you.

533
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,830
Make up your mind, Geu Rae.

534
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,950
I hope there are no issues.

535
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,210
Of course not.

536
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,270
Then?

537
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,270
?I will just buy the book.

538
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,990
The fabric?

539
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,510
?I won't take.

540
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,110
Why not?

541
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:35,480
The book has your analysis...

542
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,650
...so it will save my time.

543
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,690
The fabric can be 
acquired anytime.

544
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:46,170
I don't need to buy yours.

545
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,850
He's good.

546
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,210
You don't know what 
you're talking about.

547
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,270
All of this fabric was made...

548

 a pro's expertise.

550
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:07,090
I had to put up with being 
called a "dog" and "pervert."

551
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,880
Dog?

552
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,010
He knew that?

553
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,490
Oh, my!

554
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,170
Still, it's a crime to touch a 
woman's butt without permission.

555
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,860
I didn't touch her butt.

556

557
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,740
-I?
-You might've been touching the fabric.

558
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,630
At the same time, you're
 admitting you did touch her.

559
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,950
He's funny.

560
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,710

?happened to be on her butt.

562

You saw it.

563
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,690

565
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,230
Ok.

566

What will you do, Geu Rae?

568
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,970
Will you buy it or not?

569
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,430
If I had to study...

570
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,380
...and build expertise 
like him to sell fabric?

571
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,650
?then?

572
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,730
?I'd sell it with him.

573

and come here.

is done in the office.

what the site is?

get laid off so easily?

There's no meaningless 
product made by the company.

647

The reason a stone gets
 in trouble is...

...because you've failed
 to see intentions.

649

fails is because...

 ahead and plan.

00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,000
I made it.

733
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah?

734
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,510
That's great.

735
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,920
Intern Geu Rae becomes a 
2-year contract employee.

736
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,170
Wear this one.
It's clean.

737
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,380
You still don't know how to tie it?

738
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,680
Yes.

739
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,720
Men should know how to do this.

740
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:49,030
Becoming an adult is like that.

741
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:52,370
You need to be able 
to do certain things.

742
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,420
Neck tie.

743
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:58,560
Humble but clean shoes.

744
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,880
Neat belt.

745
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,080
Those were your dad's rules.

746
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,560
Mom.

747
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,820
What?

748
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,550
You don't know how to do it, huh?

749
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,580
Wear what you used to.

750
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,660
I forgot how to do it.

751
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:42,550
[Barber shop]

752
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,640
Wearing a tie, dress shoes...

753
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,780
...and suit makes me feel good.

754
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,780
It gives you a sense of tension.

755
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,420
Your suit makes
 you feel confident.

756
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:13,080
The pants are comfortable...

757
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,600
...thanks to the thin fabric.

758
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,080
And?

759
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,240
Geu Rae.

760
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,720
?the handkerchief 
my mom gave me.

761
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,760
Don?t wipe your sweat
 with your hands.

762
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,040
Don?t just sit anywhere.

763
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,830
Use that to wipe it.

764
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:34,660
Show with your actions, not talk.

765
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,000
Don't act like an adult, 
but be an adult.

766
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,600
Young Yi.

767
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,980
Baek Ki.

768
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,290
I knew it.

769
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:58,960
I knew you guys would make it.

770
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,630
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

771
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,490
Here.

772
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,130
I guess it's just us three.
Last year, they only chose two.

773
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,640
Hello.

774
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,440
Hello.

775
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,700
Hello.

776
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,690
I'm surprised.

777
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,100
Glad to see you, Geu Rae.

778
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:34,960
Yes.

780
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,160
I'm sorry.

781
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,570
Congratulations.

782
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,280
Thank you.

783
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,280
You're all here.

784
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,580
Congratulations.

785
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,080
I'm Lee from HR.

786
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,620
Kim Seok Ho made it too.

787
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,240
He'll be working at 
the headquarters.

788
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,740
You'll fill out some paperwork and 
go see the executive director.

789
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,020
This way, please.

790
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,480
Nice to meet you.

791
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,600
Sit down.

792
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,680
-Young Yi.
-Yes.

793
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,050
Do we know each other?

794
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,350
No, sir.

795
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,780
-Geu Rae?
-Yes?

796
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,780
[Geu Rae: "Yes" in Korean]

797
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:45,140
You contracted 100,000 won
in 10 days of interning?

798
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,930
?with an item that was 
forgotten for 2 years.

799
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,200
Please keep up the good work.

800
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,940
-Suk Yool.
-Yes!

801
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,880
Did your father teach you 
site experience is important?

802
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,580
Yes, sir.
For generations, my family?

803
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,340
I have many relatives who 
are blue collar workers.

804
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,460
We know the value
 of sweat and tears.

805
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,060
We're proud of being site workers.

806
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,330
-Geu Rae?
-Yes.

807
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,280
That's a great attitude.

808
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,560
Thank you.

809
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,700
Baek Ki.

810
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,720
I really liked your 
calm presentation.

811
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,410
Thank you.

812
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:39,640
You want to work in
 the Resources team.

813
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,000
Is it because you worked 
there as an intern?

814
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,820
No.

815
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:47,000
I think the company's future is there.

816
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,280
That's why they need elites.

817
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,800
I look forward to your work.

818
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,600
And Geu Rae.

819
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,360
Yes.

820
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,780
You're Geu Rae.

821
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,130
Yes.

822
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:07,300
Work hard.

823
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,280
Yes?

824
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:24,450
These are the work manuals 
and the dept. contact info.

825
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,580
Young Yi.

826
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,060
Baek Ki.

827
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,730
Suk Yool.
Geu Rae.

828
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,440
You know how to log in.

829
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,320
Just create an ID and passcode.

830
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,530
Here.

831
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,060
Company ID card.

832
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:43,470
Ok.

833
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,540
Check your departments.

834
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,420
Yes!

835
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,020
Where are you?

836
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,600
Resources team.

837
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,000
What about you?

838
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,680
Steel team.

839
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,120
Steel?

840
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,740
What about you?

841
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:30,800
These came in the morning, 
so you can check here.

842
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,220
If there are any issues...

843
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,850
-...I'll revise it right away.
-Ok.

844
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:35,360
Hello.

845
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,780
I'm the new employee, 
Jang Geu Rae.

846
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,370
Mr. Oh.

847
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,220
I'm here.

848
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,580
So!

849
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,640
Why you again?

850
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,880
Congratulations.
Geu Rae.

851
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,080
Thank you.

852
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,620
I'll get to work.

853
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,840
Dang.

854
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,920
Hey.

855
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,920
Where's Young Yi?

856
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,390
She?

857
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:16,380
She went to Resources.

858
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,760
Suk Yool, Fabric.

859
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,120
Baek Ki went to Steel.

860
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,900
Seok Ho went to 
the headquarters.

861
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,280
That's how it went.

862
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,410
Hey.

863
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:35,850
Why'd you come to our team?

864
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,340
I heard you asked for me.

865
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,440
Me?

866
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,080
When did I do that?

867
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,740
-Did you ask for him?
-No.

868
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,300
I didn't ask for you!

869
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,420
Hey!

870
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,330
I didn't ask for you!

871
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:53,840
Hey, you're laughing!

872
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,920
I didn't ask for you!

873
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,740
Tell him, I didn't ask for him.

874
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,600
I didn't either.

875
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,700
Mr. Ko!

876
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,970
I didn't ask for him.

877
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,480
Your team looks happy.

878
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:14,320
I'm glad Sang Sik 
did what he did.

879
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,720
The team looks tight.

880
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,800
I'm glad to put a smile 
on your faces too.

881
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,920
Work hard.

882
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,540
What was your name?

883
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,830
Jang Geu Rae.

884
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:01,160
You only got your GED.

885
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,030
Any work experience?
You know any foreign languages?

886
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,880
What did you do for 26 years?

887
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,700
You can't do anything?

888
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,840
I know.

889
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,960
What did I do for 26 years?

890
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:32,540
I'm glad Sang Sik did what he did.

891
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:34,630
The team looks tight.

892
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:38,970
I'm glad to put a smile 
on your faces too.

893
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,340
What's this?

894
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,260
Mr. Oh.

895
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,260
Slacking off from the first day?

896
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,260
No, sir.

897
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,020
Honestly?

898
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,420
?I'm not happy to see you.

899
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,420
As you know?

900
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,000
?we need someone who 
can do a million jobs.

901
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,100
I know it, sir.

902
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,060
We should've gotten Young Yi.

903
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,460
You made it anyways.

904
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,320
So try to survive.

905
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,960
You have to survive here.

906
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:20,030
Surviving means going 
towards a complete life.

907
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,000
Complete life?

908
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,160
You might not be familiar.

909
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,840
In the game of Go?

910
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,410
?there's a complete 
life and incomplete life.

911
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:42,680
We're all incomplete lives.
