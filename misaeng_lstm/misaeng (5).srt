00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,880
So, Mr. Oh really 
could've given it over.

188
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,300
Why'd you have to bring all this 
chaos when you're not sure?

189
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,580
That's not the issue here.

190
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,460
We weren't going to make 
the B/L a big issue.

191
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,640
He just went to ask and he hit him.

192
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,860
He threw him in front of everyone.

193
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,980
That shows how Mr. Oh 
disregards our team.

194
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,620
That's why I'm saying sorry.

195
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,130
Why should you be sorry?

196
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,400
The guy who hit him should be.

197
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,680
He should give an official 
apology to the one he hit.

198
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,260
Ok.

199
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,020
Alright.

200
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,580
And…

201
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,160
…tell him to upload an apology 
on the Company Intranet.

202
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,280
No way, Mr. Ma!

203
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,880
Are you trying to embarrass Mr. Oh?

204
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
He needs to be embarrassed.

205
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,380
Last year, because of him, I…

206
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,830
Anyway, if he doesn't do it, 
I'll make this a bigger issue.

207
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,820
What will you do?

208
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,940
What will you do?

209
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,260
Tell them it's bullshit.

210
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,510
Mr. Oh!

211
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,400
Hey!

212
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,800
Is Mr. Jung ok?

213
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,860
Yes.

214
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,570
He's not hurt.

215
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,100
Mr. Oh said he's sure he sent it.

216
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,620
I can't look for it.

217
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,740
I know.

218
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,920
What are you two
 so serious about?

219
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,400
You don’t want the training?

220
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,080
Geu Rae. I heard there was 
some fun on your floor.

221
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,380
Oh, I heard news about Mr. Oh 
just the other day.

222
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,860
I'm sorry about what 
I said about him on the rooftop.

223
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,480
By the way, my friend...

224
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,400
...I could see why he got upset.

225
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,640
He has a story.

226
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,010
I was told that in the past Mr. Oh…

227
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,160
Nice to meet you.

228
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,320
Sit down.

229
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,030
I'm Sun Ji Young from Sales Team 1...

230
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,360
...and I'll be in charge of training.

231
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,420
Nice to meet you.

232
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,770
I'm sure you've seen 
the emails I sent out.

233
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,400
What I sent…

234
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,470
[Husband]

235
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,880
What I sent is feedback...

236
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,940
...from our business partners…

237
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,290
<i>I have a funeral to attend.</i>

238
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,820
<i>Pick up So Mi from 
the daycare, honey.</i>

239
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,930
It shows how Sales Team 1 and 
One International work hard…

240
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,400
…on client care and 
contract management.

241
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,800
Let's see how important document...

242
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,720
...communication is
 through your emails.

243
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,500
-It's all a strategy, you know.
-Huh?

244
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,790
They don’t give you work, right?

245
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,730
They want to show who's 
boss in the beginning.

246
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,550
That's what Mr. Song said.

247
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,480
It's all because you're talented.

248
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,640
So keep your chin up.

249
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,950
Young Yi's luckier since 
you have work at least.

250
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,570
It's tough to get adjusted
 to Resources.

251
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,350
They don't know how 
to become friends with women...

252
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,890
...but I'm loved by bosses.

253
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,350
Hello, sir.

254
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,170
<i>Is training over, Young Yi?
Run here now.</i>

255
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,890
I'll be right over.

256
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,210
I'll get going.

257
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,570
My boss always needs me.

258
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,110
Oh, dear.

259
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,410
Hello, sir.

260
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,050
Sir.

261
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,410
You think you're above meetings?

262
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,750
Gosh, the meeting with 
me was nothing to you?

263
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,170
You didn't say it was urgent...

264
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,690
...so I was going to go
after finishing the proposal.

265
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,690
Accounting said they need it 
by today for setting budgets.

266
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,030
Then you should've 
pulled an all-nighter.

267
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,180
What will you do about the 
meeting on company selection?

268
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,180
This is why I can't work 
with women.

269
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,520
No sense of sacrifice.

270
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,350
What can I expect?

271
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,410
Why are you so stiff?

272
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,010
Aren't you going to 
say you're sorry?

273
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,930
I'm sorry.

274
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,370
Go.
Get out of my face.

275
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,010
You can take her there
 before you leave.

276
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,250
Leave it to your mother
 or whatever.

277
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,170
It's what we promised.

278
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,910
Are you the only one who works?

279
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,430
It's the meeting I postponed 
a week because of you.

280
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,610
I can't postpone it again.

281
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,320
Never mind, I have to 
go out for work now.

282
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm sorry about that.

283
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,490
It's ok.

284
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,870
Is something wrong?

285
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,650
Your eyes are red.

286
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,600
It's ok.

287
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,370
Oh, my.

288
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,440
Thanks.

289
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,640
So Mi's mother.

290
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,610
So Mi forgot to take this yesterday.

291
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,770
Yes.
Thanks.

292
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,590
See you…

293
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,590
Your child must have drawn it...

294
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,160
...but there's no face.

295
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,500
She didn't finish it, I guess.

296
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,500
[Columbia…]

297
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,350
[Condo export (x)]

298
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,890
[Condom export (o)]

299
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,650
Why do you keep looking at me?

300
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,090
Huh?

301
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,730
I asked, why do you 
keep looking at me?

302
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,740
Sorry.

303
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,590
<i>Are you at your seat?</i>

304
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,520
<i>Can I go see you now?</i>

305
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,560
You know…

306
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,530
…I didn't finish what I was saying.

307
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,290
Actually, you won't 
feel good about this.

308
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,750
Sit down.

309
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,150
Someone died because of Mr. Oh.

310
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,970
Stop looking over.

311
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,310
-Take care of this.
-Sure.

312
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,130
That's nonsense!

313
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,830
Sit, sit.

314
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,610
It was when he was 
an assistant manager.

315
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,270
Something his subordinate 
did went wrong.

316
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,230
Mr. Oh must've been at fault too.

317
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,270
Mr. Oh ignored him...

318
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,530
...when he resigned.

319
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,690
The subordinate opened 
a small shop with his mother.

320
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,010
But…

321
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,670
…he died in an accident 
making a delivery.

322
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,690
<i>So they're saying it wouldn't
 have happened...</i>

323
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,890
<i>...if Mr. Oh had taken 
responsibility.</i>

324
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,370
Go.

325
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,790
I'm going.

326
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,790
-Ok.
-Go.

327
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,410
Mr. Oh is something else.

328
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,730
This is so wrong of him.

329
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,210
<i>Mr. Oh wouldn't avoid
 responsibility.</i>

330
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,950
<i>You never know about people.</i>

331
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,110
<i>Who wants to get fired?</i>

332
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,560
Sir.

333
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,160
Chemicals is really being stubborn.

334
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,730
You asked for Mr. Oh's help before.

335
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,730
Now you want us out?

336
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,060
So, don't you know 
what we went through...

337
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,320
...for the Japan and China 
cases and meet with them?

338
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,820
Hey!
Give it!

339
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,500
-Give it over!
-No, that won't solve it.

340
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,560
This is too much…

341
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,720
Hey, take it!

342
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,780
How can you just give it over?

343
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,520
This has to do with our performance.

344
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,540
We did all the work and you 
want to give them the benefits?

345
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,330
How could you let that happen?

346
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,130
Mr. Oh!
Please!

347
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,340
Uh…

348
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,580
They're thinking whatever they want.

349
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,130
Why won't you say something?

350
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,020
What are they thinking wrong?

351
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,300
The executive director signed 
a contract with a bad company.

352
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,740
You know it was an absurd contract.

353
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,620
You know everyone knew 
it was a bad company.

354
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,320
I heard he 
even got a commission...

355
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,920
...while Eun Jae took all the blame!

356
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,760
His death has nothing to do with 
you, so just tell them the truth!

357
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,260
Nothing will change whether 
it was my fault or his.

358
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,600
That time…

359
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,700
…I didn't take the responsibility.

360
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,260
How I didn't say I would 
take responsibility…

361
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,360
…won't change.

362
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
Mr. Oh.

363
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,060
Mr. Oh.

364
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,880
How many people could take 
responsibility in that situation?

365
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,980
Everyone would've done the same.

366
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,240
Let's go.

367
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,500
We need to prepare 
for the training meeting.

368
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Why Eun Jae?</i>

369
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,170
If not him, will you 
take responsibility?

370
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,340
Will you do that?

371
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,200
<i>Daycare centers only
 open until 6 P.M.</i>

372
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,340
<i>We can't ask them to 
understand again.</i>

373
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,720
Soo Jin.

374
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,140
Oh, my!

375
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,280
Are you ok?

376
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,520
Soo Jin.

377
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,160
Get up, Soo Jin.

378
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,400
Come on, let's move her 
to the nursing room.

379
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
Hey, help her.

380
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,840
-Are you ok?
-Soo Jin.

381
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,180
<i>She's pregnant and she 
must have overworked herself.</i>

382
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,820
What?

383
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,380
Pregnant?

384
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,420
Yes, she needs rest.

385
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,860
Hey.
Did you know that?

386
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,960
No.

387
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,080
Geez, how many kids
 is she having?

388
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,300
Didn't you say she has two kids?

389
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,980
Yes.

390
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,700
Why'd she get pregnant again?

391
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,070
She's so selfish.

392
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,210
Move!

393
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,180
She got pregnant again?

394
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,760
Another leave?

395
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,140
We covered so much for her after 
the first and second kids.

396
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,390
When will we train the 
employees and all?

397
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,630
I busted my behind after 
she had her second kid.

398
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,420
Gosh, we'll have to borrow 
other team members.

399
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,520
Geez.

400
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,820
Women are always the problem.

401
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,810
After all that studying, they get 
married, have pregnant, a husband…

402
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,640
They have so many excuses.

403
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,240
Or they try to get a 
quick fix by crying.

404
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,920
That's because they're unloyal.

405
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,200
Do your work.

406
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,960
Ms. Sun.

407
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,280
Thank you.

408
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,880
Soo Jin's been working 
overtime for the whole week.

409
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,960
I wonder why she didn’t tell us.

410
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,770
She couldn't have.

411
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,840
Third kid is tough.

412
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,020
Times have changed, 
but working...

413
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,580
...and taking care of kids is hard.

414
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,700
Working moms are 
always at fault.

415
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,320
To the company, to in-laws…

416
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
…and of course the kid.

417
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,840
It's impossible 
without the husband's help.

418
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,000
If you want to continue 
working, don’t get married.

419
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,780
It will save you trouble.

420
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,920
-Mr. Kim.
-Yeah.

421
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,260
Time for the meeting.

422
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,660
Ok.

423
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,900
-I wish he wouldn't come.
-Huh?

424
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,720
Oh, nothing.

425
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,140
Mr. Oh.

426
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,580
Regarding the Resources
 takeover case…

427
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
How about not joining that one?

428
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,700
Why not?

429
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,260
I'm aware of everything,
so I won't make any mistakes.

430
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,580
Each team will hand in the reports.

431
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,820
Our team will give you a report...

432
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,000
...regarding the Indonesia 
case when we're ready.

433
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,790
You're aware it will take 2-3 
days to receive a reply, right?

434
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,440
I hope Resources can 
give us some more time.

435
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,000
We'll take it you'll give 
us 2-3 days and wrap it up.

436
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,470
Fine.

437
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,800
The other teams can just 
do your data organization.

438
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,840
Sometimes they keep calling us.

439
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,320
Take care of that, Mr. Ha.

440
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,270
Sure.

441
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,140
Sir.

442
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,610
I think we can wrap it up.

443
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,450
How can we wrap it up?

444
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,450
There's no B/L.

445
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,940
Sir, you can talk about that later…

446
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,600
You really won't give it over?

447
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,270
I told you it's been given over.

448
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,940
What company is in on this too?

449
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,370
How much did you pocket?

450
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,940
Sir.

451
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,820
You know Mr. Oh wouldn't do that.

452
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,680
You, be quiet.

453
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,850
Women should know their place.

454
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,680
Sir.

455
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,100
Then you should've talked 
to me in private.

456
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,220
What?

457
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,020
Why aren't you apologizing?

458
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,880
Why won't you upload it?

459
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,830
Since there's nothing 
to apologize about.

460
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,040
Why not?

461
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,070
After hitting a man?

462
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,740
Gosh.

463
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,510
You've aged, but you're 
still irresponsible.

464
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,820
Still.

465
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,000
Excuse me?

466
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,920
Irresponsible…

467
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,380
What do kids say this days?

468
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,900
Ir…

469
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,890
-Irresman.
-Yeah.

470
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,560
The irresman is evolving by the day.

471
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,380
This isn't about what 
happened last year, is it?

472
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,070
What?

473
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,120
What are you talking about?

474
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,840
The complaint regarding your 
sexual harassment issue.

475
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,020
What?

476
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,340
When I stood witness.

477
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,750
Hey Oh Sang Sik!

478
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,800
Why bring that up here?

479
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,920
And, sexual harassment?

480
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,450
Why's that sexual harassment?

481
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,600
She shouldn't have worn 
that low-cut shirt.

482
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,120
Did I touch or look inside?

483
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,760
"If you're going to hide yourself 
each time you bend over, why'd you wear that?

484
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,400
Just let it all hang out."

485
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,270
Is that sexual harassment?
That's sexual harassment?

486
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,000
That was sarcasm.

487
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,740
I meant don't wear such stuff.

488
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,610
"There's nothing worth seeing."

489
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,120
You added that.

490
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,380
So…

491
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,420
…is that sexual harassment?

492
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,660
Asking them for 
a cup of coffee is too.

493
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,800
Worrying they can't 
get married is too.

494
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,100
I hate all these tough women!

495
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,600
Young Yi.

496
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,080
You tell me.

497
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,860
Is that sexual harassment?

498
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,570
Is it?

499
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,100
Why can't you answer me?

500
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,910
I think it is…

501
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,100
…if the person who heard it…

502
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,450
…was sexually offended.

503
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,620
What?

504
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,900
Hey!

505
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,320
What did you just say?

506
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,260
Where are you going?

507
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,700
You told me to write an apology!

508
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,800
I'm going to do that!

509
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,020
You should wrap
 things up in there.

510
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,280
Yes.

511
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,280
I'm going nuts.

512
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,900
An apology?

513
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,420
You read each word carefully.

514
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,440
I'm sure he'll say something wrong.

515
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,700
Yes.

516
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Let's go.
There's a meeting with a client.

517
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,040
Gosh.

518
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,200
That jerk.

519
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,670
Geez.

520
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,850
Mr. Ma got in trouble 
for sexual harassment?

521
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,660
He got a pay cut 
for 3 months for it.

522
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,650
Mr. Oh stood witness for it?

523
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,940
Mr. Oh is hard to understand too.

524
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,840
He stands for justice 
in times like that.

525
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,860
He's so different in his 
situations, it's hard to understand.

526
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,900
Geez.

527
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,830
He's good at work though.

528
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,640
Wrap it up.

529
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,840
Mr. Kang.

530
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Wait up.

531
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,180
I wonder where the B/L went.

532
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,920
Mr. Oh is amazing.

533
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,450
He's just insisting he gave it when 
they say they didn’t receive it.

534
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,790
He's saying he gave it since he did.

535
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,090
So where is it?

536
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,240
You mean Resources is lying?

537
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,820
We were interns two months ago.

538
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,530
Baek Ki.

539
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,540
You were an intern there, right?

540
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,680
Yes.

541
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,000
You didn't see it?

542
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,870
No.

543
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,480
Baek Ki.

544
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,460
What is it?

545
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,220
The B/L.

546
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,020
You really didn't see it then?

547
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,080
I said I never saw it.
Why?

548
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,420
You were working there, so 
I was wondering if you did.

549
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,100
What are you trying to say?

550
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,810
I worked there, so I should know?

551
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,300
Do you know all about your team?

552
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,900
Why don't you go dig
 through the files?

553
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
No need to drag me into this.

554
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,490
<i>Baek Ki.</i>

555
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,400
<i>There's a B/L from the 
Sales Team 3 on the desk.</i>

556
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,760
<i>Bring that over.</i>

557
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,600
You really never saw it?

558
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,400
Why do you keep asking?

559
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,710
You never saw it?

560
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,640
It'll be better if you didn't 
know if I did or not.

561
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,780
What are you saying?

562
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,280
If I say I did, will 
you tell Sales Team 3?

563
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,100
Think about your position.

564
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,180
If that's revealed, how do you 
think Resources will treat you?

565
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,280
It's like pouring gas over fire.

566
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,800
Why do that?

567
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,420
Mr. Oh won't take your side just 
because you help Sale Team 3.

568
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,480
-Baek Ki.
-This isn't your business.

569
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,140
You're in Resources.

570
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,010
That's reality.

571
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,520
Mr. Oh is a true man.

572
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,100
[Frigging sorry.]

573
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,100
Oh, my!

574
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Geu Rae.

575
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Read it.

576
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,960
Come on.

577
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,370
Sorry.

578
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,370
All of it.

579
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,440
Sorry.

580
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,550
Frigging sorry.

581
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,600
Why, that psycho...

582
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,560
Mr. Oh.

583
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,280
Why did you do that?

584
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,520
What?

585
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,820
Why?

586
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,580
He wanted an apology, 
so I gave one.

587
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,480
I wanted to give 
a nice Granny Red...

588
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
...but they're out now.

589
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Sir!

590
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,980
Oh Sang Sik!

591
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,360
I'm going nuts.

592
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,980
I'm going nuts.

593
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,800
Sang Sik!

594
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,610
Sang Sik!

595
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,010
You want to see this to the end?

596
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,810
Come on.

597
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,140
I wrote the apology.

598
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,120
Hey, you!

599
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Do you need a lesson 
 to come back to your senses?

600
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,360
I said I'd wrap 
it up with an apology!

601
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,690
That's what I did.

602
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,330
I said I'm really sorry.

603
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,100
-What?
-Ok?

604
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,720
I'm sorry.

605
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,860
Frigging sorry.

606
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,420
-Why…
-Why, you!

607
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,000
How dare you?

608
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,800
Sir!

609
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,780
-Let go!
-Sir!

610
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,510
Sir!

611
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,880
Let go!

612
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,140
Now!

613
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,150
Let go!

614
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,450
Mr. Kim!

615
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,520
Mr. Kim!

616
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,740
Are you ok?

617
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,060
Are you ok?

618
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,720
There was a big thug
 when he got hit.

619
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,830
You want a piece of me?

620
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,240
How dare you?

621
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,480
Who do you think you are?

622
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,250
Let go!

623
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,600
Are you ok?

624
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,380
Hey.

625
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,520
Hey.

626
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,880
Are your bones okay, 
nothing broken?

627
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,700
I'll go to the hospital.

628
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,660
Go ahead.

629
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,520
Get CAT scans, MRI, 
the whole works.

630
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,870
Get a blood test too.

631
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,420
Hey! If your brain gets
 damaged, it's bad!

632
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,900
Why, that…

633
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,170
I'll be ok.

634
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,100
Really?

635
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,660
Don't worry, I'll be ok.

636
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,420
Sir, let's go.

637
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,940
Call me if there are
 any problems.

638
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,980
Geez.

639
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,140
It's ok.

640
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,870
Mr. Kim!

641
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,570
Sit down.

642
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,660
I'll go to Accounting.

643
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,570
Ok.

644
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,680
Geu Rae.

645
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,050
Get me some water.

646
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,990
Ok.

647
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,490
Oh, those jerks…

648
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,900
Sir, sir?

649
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,630
Those jerks.

650
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,900
They're trying to threaten 
us by hurting themselves now?

651
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
They're like gangsters.

652
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,780
Don’t ever work with 
Sales Team 3 again.

653
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,120
Sir, let's wrap it up.

654
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,580
Mr. Oh must've learned
 his lesson.

655
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,330
Give me my glasses.

656
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,760
Uh…

657
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,880
Geez.

658
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,820
Young Yi.
Bring me some coffee.

659
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,980
Sure.

660
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,740
What will we do?

661
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,680
The issue is getting bigger.

662
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,520
Why didn't you just say it 
when he signed it?

663
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,660
You should have 
honestly said it was left out.

664
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,420
Hey, our boss wasn't being told off 
for once and I couldn't say that.

665
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,500
Also, Mr. Oh is all worked up.

666
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,140
I couldn't do that.

667
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,860
What will we do?

668
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,740
Shall we shred it?

669
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,900
If Dong Sik asks for me, 
tell him I went for a smoke.

670
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,000
Sure.

671
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,320
<i>Mr. Oh wouldn't miss a B/L.</i>

672
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,080
Who cares if he's good?

673
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,880
You can't do anything 
about newbies.

674
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,020
You're right.

675
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,440
He won't know what
 B/Ls and drafts are.

676
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,490
Sales Team 3 is in
 the Mr. Choi's...

677
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,840
...bad book and they're 
treated poorly.

678
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,500
They have the worst 
seats and few employees.

679
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,940
That's why they have 
such a newbie.

680
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,030
Mr. Oh.

681
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,160
Why aren't you working?

682
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
I have a question.

683
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,160
You have a light?

684
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,440
No, sir.

685
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,670
Men should know how to smoke.

686
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,000
I used to smoke 3 packs
 a day when I was your age.

687
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,280
And you don't know the basic.

688
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,680
You should have a 
lighter to serve others.

689
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,380
I'm sorry.

690
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,700
What's your question?

691
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,420
Uh…

692
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,940
The B/L.

693
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,720
Is there any possibility you 
gave it and I missed it?

694
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,800
Huh?

695
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
So…

696
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,370
…are you covering for me…

697
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,400
No, right.

698
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,280
Go do your work!

699
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,280
Geu Rae.

700
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,200
Hi.

701
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,930
-Make two copies and file them.
-Yes.

702
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,800
Mr. Kim.

703
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,060
What?

704
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,680
How long do you keep 
received B/Ls?

705
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,800
Why?
You want to look for it?

706
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,140
Shall I?

707
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,870
No way.

708
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,240
You want to go search 
another team's stuff?

709
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,580
That's nonsense.

710
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,020
If it was possible, 
I would've done it already.

711
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,020
-Hurry up with that.
-Yes.

712
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,900
What was he talking about?

713
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,520
About B/L…

714
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,920
I hope he doesn't 
search Resources.

715
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,060
He can't be that stupid.

716
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,240
Look.

717
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
Yes.

718
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,580
Bring this for the buyer meeting.

719
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,640
Yes.

720
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,720
Again?

721
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,340
We postponed it last week.

722
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,960
I know.

723
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,520
Delay it for just 3 hours.

724
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,960
I'm sorry.

725
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,040
Ok.

726
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,740
Sign this.

727
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,970
Sure.

728
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,140
You're picking up your kid?

729
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,680
Your parents can't?

730
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,800
Right.

731
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,950
I have to leave her 
with my in-laws.

732
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,300
I'm a guy too, 
but guys think...

733
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,440
...girls should give in all the time.

734
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,160
They don't know how hard girls...

735
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,180
...have to work to climb 
up the ladder.

736
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,700
That too.

737
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,040
I know.

738
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,480
That's why my wife stopped 
working too.

739
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,810
You have three kids.

740
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,120
If not, I would've quit.

741
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,040
What's he doing?

742
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,960
Good job.

743
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,020
About keeping silent.

744
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,140
Geu Rae.

745
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,720
Why are you lurking 
around Resources?

746
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,500
Were you looking for the B/L?

747
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,630
No, sir.

748
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,660
Then why'd you go there?

749
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,380
Did you go to see Young Yi?

750
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,680
Come here.

751
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,680
Did you ask Young Yi?

752
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
No, I…

753
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,320
Why didn't you ask her?

754
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,430
Should I ask her?

755
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,430
No way!

756
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,340
Who told you to lurk 
around there?

757
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,280
Don't you have work to do?

758
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,880
I'm sorry.

759
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,440
-Geu Rae.
-Huh?

760
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,440
[Geu Rae: "Yes" in Korean]

761
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,040
Not you.

762
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,080
Go on a business trip 
if you're so idle.

763
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,300
Huh?

764
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,190
Ms. Sun.

765
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,900
This isn't right.

766
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,660
It's ok.

767
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,100
No.

768
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,330
It could become a problem if a 
subordinate gets involved in personal issues.

769
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,140
Hold on.

770
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,080
Mr. Oh, Geu Rae…

771
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,080
<i>It's ok.</i>

772
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,610
<i>I don't want him to 
cause accidents here.</i>

773
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,900
<i>I can't be any more embarrassed.</i>

774
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,640
Mr. Oh is really doing 
things his way today.

775
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,720
Thanks.

776
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,040
No problem.

777
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,140
Meeting a client?

778
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,620
Yes.

779
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,150
I'm going for Ms. Sun's child.

780
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,440
Huh?

781
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,700
That's good.

782
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,020
I'll see you tomorrow.

783
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,190
Geu Rae.

784
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,830
Is Mr. Oh ok?

785
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,830
Huh?

786
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,060
Mr. Oh shouldn't have brought...

787
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,460
...up what happened before.

788
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,980
He should respect people have...

789
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,320
...things they don’t want 
brought up again.

790
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,360
I understand why Mr. Oh 
got that mad.

791
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,100
He's not mad now.

792
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,900
He's blaming himself.

793
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,740
Most bad choices become 
regrets and get forgotten...

794
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
...but not always.

795
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,080
Some things haunt you forever.

796
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,610
They don’t get forgotten...

797
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,520
...and you can't take them back.

798
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,840
He's blaming himself.

799
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,250
He looks lonely to me.

800
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,580
I came to get So Mi.

801
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,300
Yes.

802
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,640
I got a call from So Mi's mother.

803
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,500
Let's go home, So Mi.

804
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,100
Ok.

805
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,400
Alright.

806
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,900
They're in the all-day class.

807
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,900
Their mothers will come soon.

808
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,530
Where's my mom?

809
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,520
She'll come soon.

810
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,840
Let's go wait inside.

811
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,600
Let's go.

812
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,700
Can they play with me 
in the playground?

813
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,560
We have to be with 
them as guardians.

814
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,840
The teacher will go home 
soon and I have to work.

815
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,460
I'll stay with them.

816
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,740
I'll just go home late.

817
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,600
The flower has bloomed.

818
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,440
The flower has bloomed.

819
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,300
The flower has bloomed.

820
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,900
The flower has bloomed.

821
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,700
Come on.

822
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,310
1, 2, 3.

823
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,250
Nice.
You're fast.

824
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,680
Nice.

825
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,820
Hello.

826
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,940
Let's go home.

827
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,100
Let's go home.

828
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,320
Bye.

829
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,120
Bye.

830
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,780
Bye.

831
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,280
Up you go.

832
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,680
<i>Some things haunt you forever.</i>

833
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,180
<i>They don’t get forgotten...</i>

834
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,360
<i>...and you can't take them back.</i>

835
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,700
We'll take care of that, oh!

836
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,740
I'll call you back.

837
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,080
Thanks.

838
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,260
Is everyone gone?

839
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,680
They went to the buyers' meeting.

840
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,020
I'll carry some.

841
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,460
Thanks.

842
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,800
Resources is tough, isn't it?

843
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,440
It's always been tough for women.

844
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:25,260
They always discriminate 
between the genders...

845
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,800
...but only elites go there.

846
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,860
You're hanging in there very well.

847
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,310
It's not that easy.

848
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,600
Right?

849
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,600
Uh, Ms. Sun…

850
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,360
I have a question.

851
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,630
Sure.

852
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:01,080
There's something I should 
do and I know it's right.

853
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,080
I'm hesitant about it though.

854
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,180
Why?

855
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,840
It might complicate things.

856
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,720
Does it have to do 
with Resources?

857
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,650
Does ignoring something 
that's right...

858
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,040
...make things more simple?

859
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,680
At least, you can avoid criticism.

860
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,490
It's because I'm a girl…

861
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,530
I don't know what it is.

862
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,060
What does gender have 
to do with what's right?

863
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,560
It has to do with…

864
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,050
…your conscience.

865
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,300
<i>Regarding conscience…</i>

866
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,450
<i>Everyone knows.</i>

867
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,680
<i>There are people who don't 
do it when they know…</i>

868
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,640
<i>…those who do because they know.</i>

869
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,020
Geu Rae.

870
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,310
Sorry.

871
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,990
For telling you now.

872
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,610
It would've been better
 if I'd brought the B/L...

873
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,370
...but I couldn't possibly do that.

874
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:33,630
Anyway, I'm in Resources.

875
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,230
Yes.

876
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,530
It's in the bottom file box.

877
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,810
This is the cabinet number.

878
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:53,070
I'll take care of So Mi.

879
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,570
Thank you.

880
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,790
Who are you?

881
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,310
I'm So Mi's teacher.

882
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,370
I work for One International.

883
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,810
I'm taking care of
 So Mi for Geu Rae.

884
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,550
I guess he had to go.

885
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:44,370
Yes.
He had to go for work.

886
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:54,130
By the way, are you two dating?

887
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,450
Huh?

888
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,170
No.

889
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,670
Then please give me
 his cell number.

890
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,890
Huh?

891
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,770
She said it was here.

892
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,090
Who's that?

893
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,910
Why, you…

894
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,150
What are you doing?

895
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,010
Why, you…

896
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,630
How dare you go through 
our cabinet?

897
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,930
Come here.

898
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,410
You…

899
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,750
You came for the B/L, huh?

900
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:22,930
Did Mr. Oh ask you?

901
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:23,990
No.

902
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,610
Come, you're dead.

903
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,170
I know what he's like.

904
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,370
Is this what you
 learned from him?

905
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,540
I know the B/L is here.

906
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,410
What are you saying?

907
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:38,740
Where is Sang Sik?

908
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,310
He went home after asking 
his subordinate to steal?

909
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,170
I'll make sure he can't 
work here again.

910
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,550
Where is he?
Tell him to come now.

911
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,050
Tell him to come now, jerk!

912
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,350
Ha!

913
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,910
The guy with no connection
 brings in this guy...

914
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,530
... through nepotism and
 makes him steal?

915
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,610
Hey.

916
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,650
The guy with no connections is here.

917
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,490
What are you doing?

918
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:42,210
I've been respecting you.

919
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,050
You want to be embarrassed 
in front of a newbie?

920
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,470
Or you want to go to the rooftop?

921
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:05,250
How do we know 
if it's from you or us?

922
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,330
We don't...

923
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:11,070
...but you and I know.

924
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:17,070
What no… nonsense is that?

925
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:21,550
Someone knows it's
 from Resources.

926
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,830
Who?

927
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,390
Who knows?

928
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,530
I won't let you go…

929
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,390
…if you bring up Yun Jae again.

930
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:38,670
Ok?

931
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:39,970
Yes.

932
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,190
Also…

933
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,210
…if you screw Sales
 Team 3 again…

934
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,090
…I'll kill you.

935
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,570
Ok.

936
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,880
Tell Mr. Ma you found it.

937
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,310
Mr. Oh…

938
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:02,930
Upload an apology.

939
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,550
Please…

940
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,890
Or I'll kill you.

941
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,110
I'm sorry.

942
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,430
Shall we have a drink?

943
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,670
Mr. Oh…

944
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:18,390
Can I ask you a question?

945
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,120
No.

946
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:28,120
How did you know the 
Resources cabinet number?

947
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:30,470
Someone told me.

948
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,790
Who?

949
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:36,130
None of your business.

950
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:34,110
How come she didn't
 draw my face?

951
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:47,510
Why are you so late?

952
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,760
I'm sorry.

953
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,260
-Where's So Mi?
-Sleeping.

954
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,160
-She drew this?
-Yeah.

955
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:59,190
She didn't draw my face.

956
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,500
I look like a ghost.

957
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,710
I have nothing to say either.

958
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,350
I guess I'm always sleeping.

959
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,290
You have golf tomorrow, right?

960
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:14,350
Your clothes are ready.

961
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,450
Things will be smooth.

962
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,830
I'll take care of So Mi tomorrow.

963
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,950
I'll come straight home.

964
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:26,370
<i>There's no solution.</i>

965
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:29,050
<i>We're working hard for ourselves...</i>

966
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,350
<i>...but we're suffering because of it.</i>

967
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:35,070
<i>It'll be better when So Mi grows a bit.</i>

968
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:38,650
Yes.
Right.

969
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,710
I'll take it there before 10.

970
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:42,050
It's ready…

971
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:43,680
Hello.

972
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,170
So Mi, you came.

973
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:48,290
Yes.
That's no problem.

974
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:50,170
We're making the orders.

975
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,030
I'll call you back.

976
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,970
So Mi, say bye.

977
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,730
1, 2, 3.

978
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,470
Bye.

979
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,910
<i>You were always looking
 at me like that.</i>

980
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,940
<i>The back of my head.</i>

981
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,810
See you later.

982
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:37,750
<i>I won't push you away again.</i>

983
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,130
So Mi.

984
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:46,770
Will you draw me today?

985
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:50,080
Ok, I'll draw you.

986
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,970
Honey!

987
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:04,920
Where are my socks?

988
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,230
Socks.

989
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,530
Why'd you drink so much?

990
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,450
Bye, dad.

991
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:14,850
Ok.

992
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:20,190
Study hard.

993
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,990
Work hard!

994
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:25,710
-Ok.
-Bye!

995
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,050
What?

996
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,330
It won't open.

997
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:40,110
Why is he here?

998
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:41,550
What is it?

999
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,410
Oh…

1000
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,770
He brought you 
here last night...

1001
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,190
...but I guess he was 
too drunk to go.

1002
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,350
What?

1003
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,610
Hey!

1004
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:02,510
Geu Rae.

1005
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,230
What are you doing?

1006
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:05,870
Oh…

1007
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,350
Hello.

1008
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,880
[Misaeng]

1009
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:40,850
Hurray!

1010
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,850
This is what life is!

1011
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,500
Here you go.

1012
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,730
I heard it was you who 
told about the B/L.

1013
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:49,230
This must be what adultery feels like.

1014
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,370
Come on.

1015
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:51,630
You don't like this?

1016
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,730
Oh, it's nice.

1017
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,210
What will happen to Dong Sik?

1018
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:56,850
-He has a GED.
-I heard there's a lot to learn from you.

1019
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:59,650
I said one thing.
Do it the right way.

1020
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:01,540
-I'm stupid.
-Fool.

1021
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,090
Gather all the teams now.

1022
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:06,630
I'll be waiting…

1023
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:06,780

1024
