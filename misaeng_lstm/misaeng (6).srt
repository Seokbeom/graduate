- Wait a while for now.

finally worked out?

Yes!

35
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,290
This is totally worth it!

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,540
Congratulations!

37
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,620
You said that tie was from your 
kids and it's really amazing.

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,430
You owe it to that.

I knew he was referring 
to this as a "treat."

45
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,060
That's why I'm making it myself.

This is a golden ratio, you know.

Drink up.

53

Why can't you come when 
you passed the cycle test?

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,540
The data isn't that hard to receive!

55
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,830
I think...

56
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,120
...the cost is a bigger issue.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,170
Did you show them 
the appropriate price?

58
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,340
If you consider the production cost and 
general expenses, that's reasonable!

59
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,760
Yes, but they think it's unreasonable.

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,730
Hey!

61
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,490
I told you to fix your attitude.

66
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,430

Of course.

cooperates well with the client.

You copy/pasted the 
Indonesian document, right?

84
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,630
I used Mr. Ha's document
 for an MOU.

85
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,890
I got it mixed up with

How will you redo it?

I heard you told them about the B/L.

...Sales Teams 1, 2's work 
will go smoothly.

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,500
It's ok.

367
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,590
She can stay.

368
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,020
You want the alcohol 
you kept here?

369
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,330
Just keep it.

370
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,930
Let's open a new one.
How's that?

371
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,870
Sure.

372
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,190
Bring it.

373
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,950
Come on.

374
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,990
What, are you uncomfortable?

375
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,760
This doesn't suit your taste?

376
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,700
Come on, I like it.

377
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,990
Where did you go for
 college, Geu Rae?

378
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,360
Oh, I…

379
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,500
He has a GED.

380
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,330
GED?

381
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,510
You guys don’t care about 
educational backgrounds?

382
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,910
That's a great company!

383
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,620
Of course.

384
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,820
They recognized an elite.

385
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,390
Thanks.

386
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,590
Here, let's have a drink.
Fill up your glass.

387
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,420
Fill it up.

388
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,380
Nice to see you.

389
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,530
Come on.

390
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,930
Nice to see you.

391
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,560
Is your liver ok?

392
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,100
I can drink alcohol when I want, but 
you have to drink when others want it.

393
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,870
Dude, how could it be ok?

394
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,330
My gall bladder's messed up too.

395
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,620
Man.

396
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,990
I thought you'd succeed as 
you were such a great student.

397
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,590
Look at yourself now
 at a trading firm.

398
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,580
What fulfillment do you get there?

399
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,360
Our trading firm is proud though.

400
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,070
There are only two jobs that 
end with "man" in Korea.

401
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,020
Stocksman and tradingman.

402
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,390
They both have to kiss up to others.

403
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,820
Sometimes others kiss up to us.

404
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,900
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes.

405
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,070
Hey.

406
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,170
- Turtles…
- What about them?

407
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,960
You know how they roll?

408
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,990
I'll pour you a drink.

409
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,990
Yeah?

410
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,900
You're good-looking.

411
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,100
Does your company hire by looks?

412
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,100
Then how did this dude make it in?

413
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,760
Oh, come on.

414
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,160
Look at him.

415
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,140
Come on, I used to be…

416
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,980
Don't forget, I'll be 
waiting for your call.

417
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,990
Don't worry, buddy.

418
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,330
You can trust me.

419
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,990
Oh, Mr. Driver…

420
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,500
Here you go!

421
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,850
Ok.

422
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,270
Hey!

423
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,700
Here!

424
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,800
Oh!

425
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,790
Bye!

426
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,050
Shall I catch a cab for you, Mr. Oh?

427
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,420
Yeah.

428
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,700
Come on.

429
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,950
Gosh.

430
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,630
<i>What do you think will happen?</i>

431
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,600
<i>I think it'll work out.</i>

432
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,560
<i>Let me know when they call.</i>

433
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,790
Wait!

434
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,660
We need the hangover tonic!

435
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,270
Yeah.

436
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,470
So…

437
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,070
…how much do you need?

438
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,540
Does he want it or do 
you want him to do it?

439
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,390
It seems he wants to 
copy his friends.

440
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,390
$150 three times a week
 is $600 a month.

441
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,250
I know it's not a waste.

442
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,570
Sir.

443
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,170
I'll try contacting the 
pipe exporting companies.

444
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,190
I told you there's nothing
 you can do.

445
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,380
- I'll try it first.
- How?

446
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,100
- I'll search…
- I don't need your help.

447
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,390
Mr. Kang.

448
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,470
Mr. Park.

449
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,730
The electric wheelchair one…

450
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,400
Why'd you discontinue it?

451
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,990
I said I'd review it if you could 
get accurate profits calculated.

452
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,130
Not this company.

453
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,070
It's a small company...

454
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,820
...but R&D is under way,
so if you work…

455
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,620
We can't connect clients 
not knowing...

456
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,850
...the profit-to-investment ratio.

457
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,590
I told you many times.

458
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,470
Still, you know…

459
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,260
I'll call the company again.

460
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,430
Ok.

461
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,330
I'll return some books.

462
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,810
Return mine too.

463
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,490
Mr. Park.

464
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,620
- Yes.
- How's that case going?

465
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,490
What did they say?

466
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,230
Don't you know the buyer 
is bugging me?

467
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,130
Yes, I'll call them again.

468
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,560
You keep calling with no results!

469
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,670
I'm sorry.

470
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,560
Don't be on the phone 
all day, run over there!

471
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,190
Resolve the issue.

472
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,760
Yes, sir.

473
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,650
Oh, sorry, Mr. Park!

474
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,670
I was about to call you.

475
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,260
You didn't have to come here.

476
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,360
Sun Young, coffee.

477
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,820
I'm sorry.

478
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,070
When will the delayed item
 issue be resolved?

479
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,500
We're securing goods in 
stock, so wait 2-3 days.

480
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,930
You said that last time.

481
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,360
If you say that again, 
I'll get in trouble.

482
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,790
- I'm sure you have your reasons but…
- Sorry.

483
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,070
Actually, my daughter 
got into a car accident.

484
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,790
Huh?

485
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,300
Was she hurt badly?

486
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,930
No.

487
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,950
She was, but she'll be ok.

488
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,960
Anyway, I'll do my best 
to resolve your issue.

489
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,670
- Sorry.
- Well.

490
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,820
I'm sure the shipping 
issue will be resolved.

491
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,730
You didn't do it on purpose.

492
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,870
Anyway, I'm worried 
about your daughter.

493
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,590
You must be concerned.

494
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,340
Yeah…

495
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,990
Yes, sir.

496
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,650
I just met with him.

497
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,220
He hadn't checked the 
items for Guangzhou.

498
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,350
They're securing goods in stock.

499
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,990
<i>So?</i>

500
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,050
I asked them to hurry up with it and…

501
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,990
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

502
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,190
<i>If you went all the way there, you 
should have brought up freight compensation…</i>

503
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,250
<i>...so they can understand this issue.</i>

504
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,360
<i>Don’t come back until
 you resolve it!</i>

505
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,450
Yes.

506
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,160
- How did it go?
- I heard it went smoothly.

507
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,220
Then why is there no call?

508
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,500
Don't worry, he's his friend.

509
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,270
He said to trust him.

510
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,930
Don't you think this is too much?

511
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,960
You made us become scapegoats.

512
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,700
Stop bugging us.

513
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,730
One International, 
Jang Geu Rae speaking.

514
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,050
Wilmart Purchasing Team?

515
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,390
Hold on.
I'll put Mr. Oh on.

516
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,500
Oh Sang Sik speaking.

517
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,850
Yes.

518
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,700
Yes.

519
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,020
Ok.

520
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,700
Dude…

521
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,160
Friend?

522
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,220
I thought he was your friend!

523
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,690
You shouldn't have said it, then.

524
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,050
We would've made a different 
strategy if you hadn't.

525
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,360
You totally ruined it all!

526
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,700
What are you going to do now?

527
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,530
You said we can trust you!

528
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,160
What are you going to do now?

529
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,040
You said we could have trust.

530
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,790
You said he's your friend 
and we could have trust, no?

531
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,850
What's this now?

532
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,550
Mr. Oh, say something.

533
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,720
What's the reason?

534
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,490
You don’t like the delivery
 conditions?

535
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,890
No, those are great.

536
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:39,960
Our company never had 
intentions to begin with.

537
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,000
We thought it lacked marketability.

538
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,470
Then why'd you waste 
time if that's the case?

539
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,500
You used to take 
my side dishes before.

540
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,930
What?

541
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,130
<i>I'm just kidding.</i>

542
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,350
You have something against me?

543
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,220
No, we're not kids.

544
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,120
I used to a long ago.

545
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,330
So…

546
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,390
…what about the past?

547
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,820
We're not kids.

00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,360
<i>Did I want to become a nice 
guy who never complains?</i>

730
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,960
<i>Did I ever take responsibility 
at the workplace?</i>

731
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,530
- Sir.
- Mr. Park.

732
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,700
We made a mistake.

733
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,930
We'll take care of it now.

734
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,970
- Ok?
- Will it be ok…

735
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,360
…to do it by the book?

736
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,850
<i>If I don't do it now…</i>

737
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,960
…it'll be the same wherever I go.<i></i>

738
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,020
I have nothing to say, Mr. Park.

739
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,320
I'm really sorry.

740
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,590
I'll fix it today…

741
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,820
…and make sure it 
leaves Incheon tomorrow.

742
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,420
I told you we'll do it by the book.

743
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,390
Mr. Park.

744
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,160
It's my fault.

745
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,760
It's all my fault.

746
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,500
We've worked with One 
International for years.

747
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,540
Mr. Park, we go way 
back with your boss.

748
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,470
We have a long history.

749
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:28,300
Wouldn't it be a waste for 
that trust to be broken?

750
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,850
Let's keep things positive.

751
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,730
Let's make things smooth.

752
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,560
<i>This is how they treat me.</i>

753
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,390
<i>I was such a pushover to them.</i>

754
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:47,850
You've already embarrassed
 me enough.

755
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,300
How low will you drag me?

756
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,250
Mr. Park.

757
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,050
I'm sorry.

758
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,580
Despite our long history, 
we made a mistake.

759
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,550
You wanted to do it by the book.

760
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,980
What do you mean by that?

761
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,250
Contract termination 
or compensation?

762
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,060
I'll…

763
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,660
…discuss that with the headquarters
 and let you know.

764
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,590
Why are you so foolish?

765
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,470
You wanted to make a few bucks.

766
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,730
So you become enemies 
with our old partner?

767
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,930
What will you do?

768
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,390
<i>Because of me…</i>

769
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,870
<i>…a partner relationship of 
10 years is going to break.</i>

770
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,980
<i>I should have just overlooked it.</i>

771
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:44,760
We're about to lose a precious 
client because of you!

772
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,730
Uh…

773
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,590
- Today.
- Sir…

774
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,270
I've never been this 
embarrassed in my life!

775
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,530
<i>A move you make when 
things don't look good.</i>

776
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,100
Are you crazy about money?

777
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,170
<i>The move you make to turn the tables…</i>

778
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:00,700
- You love money?
-<i> …is called a clever move…</i>

779
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,170
<i>…in the game of Go.</i>

780
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,850
- Geez.
- <i>If the clever move was brilliant…</i>

781
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,450
- I'm sorry.
-<i> …it proves they had the upper hand.</i>

782
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,270
Calm down.

783
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,220
<i>Mr. Park didn't think 
it would come to this.</i>

784
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,070
<i>The reason they were shocked and 
continued to persuade him…</i>

785
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,070
<i>…is because Mr. Park 
wasn't like this before.</i>

786
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,730
<i>It's like they're looking 
one way or another.</i>

787
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,700
<i>He's looking at them, but 
he's criticizing Mr. Park.</i>

788
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,300
- I have no choice.
- Please, sir.

789
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,360
I should go beg myself.

790
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,730
<i>Mr. Kim, please call me.</i>

791
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,010
- Please calm down.
- Let go!

792
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,240
We'll take care of it now.

793
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,590
Let go!

794
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,220
Sorry, the company is calling me.

795
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,270
- Ok.
- Let go.

796
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:52,520
It's so late now.

797
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,050
Oh, dear.

798
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,330
What if you get in trouble?

799
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,090
No, I came for work.

800
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,190
Also, I'm with you.

801
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,100
Yes, Mr. Kim, we're here.

802
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,190
Yes.

803
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,570
Hello?

804
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,850
You can't hear me?

805
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,010
When are we coming?

806
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,250
I think it'll take a while.

807
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,450
There's a problem here.

808
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,850
The president will visit 
us and explain himself.

809
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:25,520
<i>Clever moves are…</i>

810
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,250
He said so himself.

811
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,020
<i>…dealt with by proper moves.</i>

812
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,120
I'll report to you when we're done.

813
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,020
Yes.

814
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,700
- There's an issue with Yeong Seong?
- Yes.

815
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,070
I got a call from Mr. Park...

816
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,560
...and the president
 and employees are coming.

817
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,040
I checked and there 
were delivery problems.

818
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,390
What's this?

819
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:53,760
There are so many.

820
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,380
Call the risk management, 
inspection and business teams.

821
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,320
I'll report this to the 
executive director.

822
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,650
- Hey.
- Yes.

823
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,930
Come over here.

824
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,530
Organize these.

825
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,930
Did you call the forwarding agency?

826
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,590
This is the IT Sales team.

827
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,790
Our Guangzhou case…

828
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,600
Please get the contract ready for us.

829
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,670
Don't forget the data on 
shipment dates and schedule.

830
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,420
There was a problem
 with Yeong Seong.

831
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,640
Check the accurate limits now.

832
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,190
Isn't it a reliable company 
with a good history?

833
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,510
Can you prepare a file 
on what happened?

834
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:54,960
Oh my.

835
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,330
Coming…

836
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:00,440
Hello, Geu Rae.

837
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,670
What's going on?

838
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,900
Which floor?

839
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,730
Hello, sir.

840
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,500
Oh, Mr. Kim.

841
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,070
I'm so sorry.

842
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,940
Please wait in the guest room.

843
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,040
Take him there.

844
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,380
You go with me.

845
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,510
Who are you?

846
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,790
Jang Geu Rae in Sales Team 3.

847
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,870
Sir.

848
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,190
Can he go with me?

849
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,100
How could I…

850
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:40,790
It'll be a good learning
 experience...

851
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,670
...and he played 
a big part at the site.

852
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,980
So I'll need him.

853
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,470
Baek Ki.

854
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,850
Yeong Seong or whatever
 is here now.

855
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,790
Our risk management and 
legal teams are all there.

856
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,490
I'm surprised.

857
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,360
He didn't seem that brave.

858
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,700
It's a big issue.

859
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,360
Geu Rae went into 
that big meeting.

860
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,270
What?

861
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,790
Young Yi.

862
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,050
Gosh.

863
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,650
There was a big issue today.

864
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,850
Geu Rae is going into 
One International's big meeting.

865
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:23,390
How could a newbie go in there?

866
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,300
He might get promoted 
before us all.

867
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,620
What is it?

868
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,960
GED legend.

869
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,270
I don’t know how he's 
going to be any help.

870
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:35,220
They must've taken him 
in since he's some help.

871
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,090
Baek Ki is being patient too.

872
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:41,900
Experiences of such meetings are 
very helpful for newbies like us.

873
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,820
Baek Ki…

874
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,820
…why'd you come back?

875
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,710
I didn't think I should be there.

876
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,960
Honestly…

877
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,390
…he's not like you, right?

878
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,300
Right, you know…

879
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:03,020
Yeah, he is indecisive.

880
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,650
He's not strong-willed.

881
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,620
Clients don't prioritize him either.

882
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,130
Geu Rae stayed there
 until the end.

883
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,730
Maybe it's being nosy.

884
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,500
Anyway, Yeong Seong is
 in big trouble.

885
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,330
It's over for them.

886
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,670
Well…

887
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:24,070
…it depends on Mr. Park's testimony.

888
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,220
I think they'll 
probably just let it go.

889
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,390
People like him just
 avoid problems.

890
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,650
He doesn’t have...

891
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,160
...what it takes to solve them.

892
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,650
Were there similar cases?

893
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:43,860
Yes.
There was.

894
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,790
They weren't situations to secure 
products from other locations.

895
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,730
There no were penalties, 
so the loss wasn't huge.

896
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,830
The items didn't require prompt 
treatment, so the risks weren't big either.

897
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:57,330
Regardless of compensation, 
contract review is inevitable.

898
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:58,400
It's been seven times.

899
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,130
It's not worth a case.

900
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,010
Why did this happen?

901
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,500
Mr. Park will explain 
since he's in charge.

902
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,590
I'll…

903
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,730
…explain.

904
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,250
<i>Mr. Park was overwhelmed 
by the gravity of the case.</i>

905
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:26,930
<i>He's concerned about the 
other company's crisis.</i>

906
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,850
<i>That's foolish.</i>

907
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,130
Mr. Park.

908
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:37,420
For your reference.

909
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,730
Thanks.

910
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,390
I'll tell you what hap…

911
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,260
<i>The secret is to…</i>

912
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:04,760
<i>…scrap unnecessary 
things when in a crisis.</i>

913
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,600
<i>Become irresponsible!</i>

914
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:10,650
<i>Scrap it.</i>

915
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,180
<i>You can't take care of everyone.</i>

916
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,410
<i>You need to survive here.</i>

917
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:30,730
I'll report…

918
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,860
…what happened.

919
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,250
I'm sorry, sir.

920
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,160
We were wrong.

921
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,870
No, it's my fault.

922
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:47,280
<i>There were seven freight delays.</i>

923
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,180
I found out the cause today.

924
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:55,020
Yeong Seong was focusing
 on other transactions...

925
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,960
...while increasing clients.

926
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,250
Our shipments were 
delayed in the process.

927
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:03,560
I found out about it today...

928
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,790
...and asked about 
the responsibility.

929
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:08,730
You found out because 
you went to the site.

930
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,970
Yes, you should always 
check with them.

931
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,130
But…

932
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,320
…there are some 
problems regarding this.

933
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,730
While those issues occurred...

934
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,650
...I didn't do anything 
about it as the one in charge.

935
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:44,450
The fact is we didn't realize 
how serious this was in the beginning.

936
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,650
Also, I wasn't...

937
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,160
...confident about my work.

938
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,280
I'm the one to blame here.

939
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,820
I'm the one...

940
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,590
...that made them think it was ok.

941
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:18,190
I didn't take responsibility.

942
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,900
I'm the one…

943
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,870
…who's responsible.

944
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,300
When the industry increased shipment 
costs with oil cost increases…

945
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,700
…our company decreased them.

946
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:55,930
I couldn't pursuade them as 
a company representative.

947
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,160
That's why they looked 
for other profits.

948
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,330
I just thought about leaving...

949
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,050
...with frustration about work.

950
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:17,050
I think I'm at fault for this.

951
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,830
I'll take responsibility.

952
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,230
Save…

953
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,130
…them.

954
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,340
Keep the contract.

955
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,300
Don't…

956
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,350
…penalize them.

957
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,830
When did you start working here?

958
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,360
Huh?

959
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,930
He's been here for four years.

960
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,870
You're a romantic guy.

961
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:18,450
Would we abandon a 10-year 
partner because of this?

962
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:20,620
Who are you?

963
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,960
Why should you take responsibility?

964
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,360
How will you?

965
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:27,520
You should think
 about now, though.

966
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,530
It'll be bad for you, your 
family, and the company later.

967
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,200
It's a good thing,
 so keep thinking.

968
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,650
Wrap it up well.

975

What?

978
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,960
<i>IT Sales, Mr. Park.</i>

979
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,100

didn't get in trouble either</i>.<i></i>

980

Suk…

990
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,150
Why are you so down when 
Mr. Park's case went well?

991
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,370
