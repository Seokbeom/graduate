 it didn't suit the market trends,

out during the review.

I think you should go with

I don't know why it's on hold.

181
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,430
So?

182
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,210
You said you'd do it?
That you'd get approval?

183
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,070
I don't think that's what Resources 
wanted to hear from you.

184
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,810
Just let them win.

185
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,530
Just say, "Sorry, I can't 
do it, I need help."

186
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,970
As far as I know, the business
 team approved it,

187
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,870
but the manager of Finance didn't.

188
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,350
Manager of Finance?

189
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,210
The fastest way to get 
a reply is to go to her.

190
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,580
But it won't be easy to meet with her.

191
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,310
Just... lose for them.

192
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,810
It looks like it's going to rain.

193
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,270
Yeah.

194
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,470
I think it'll be a quick shower.

195
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,790
You want to have a drink later?

196
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,740
Huh?

197
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,810
Boss badmouthing time.

198
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,030
Dong Sik, did you look 
into the Iran item?

199
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,840
They said they'd 
review the documents I sent.

200
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,150
Sales Team 3, 
is this the Risk team?

201
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,490
Did you check the documents?

202
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,090
Yes, the Iran case?

203
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,530
Give me the documents, Geu Rae.

204
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,290
Yes, there won't be any problems 
later as long as we have cooperation.

205
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,290
Meeting at 3PM?

206
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,970
Please hurry and 
check your email.

207
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,650
Thanks.

208
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,070
-Dong Sik!
-Yes

209
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,670
One International, 
Jang Geu Rae speaking.

210
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,100
The documents are ready.

211
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,200
I'll have them approved 
after Mr. Oh reviews them.

212
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,450
Bye.

213
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,710
-One International, Jang Geu Rae?
-It's raining.

214
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,390
Shall about a drink after work?

215
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,670
I'm busy.

216
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,150
Hello, sir.

217
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,420
Victory!

218
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,790
The email we requested?

219
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,610
You should drink and release 
stress from bosses on days like this.

220
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,010
Look at our circumstances.

221
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,400
What do you think?

222
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,050
Please leave.

223
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,170
Mr. Oh.

224
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,950
True tradingmen would go for drinks?

225
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,080
-Dong Sik, the Iran data.
-Yes.

226
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,750
Don't you agree?

227
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,090
-Please leave.
-What is it you want to say?

228
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,520
Geu Rae, wrap up and go 
drink with him, he's right.

229
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,020
No, sir.

230
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,290
Baek Ki, let's have a drink together.

231
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,070
All the newbies.

232
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,950
Thank you, Mr. Oh.

233
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,510
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

234
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,470
Hello.

235
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,770
Come on.

236
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,270
The two alcohol lovers 
won't come, I guess they're fine.

237
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,450
Let's get out.

238
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,730
Why?

239
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,110
This place is for having dates.
It's not a man's place.

240
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,510
Suk Yool...

241
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,540
What?

242
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,770
What?

243
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,290
You said you didn't want to drink.

244
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,970
You should've consulted me 
with your concerns, Young Yi.

245
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,860
Baek Ki has his own worries.

246
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,260
How can he be counselling you?

247
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,060
Look at his face.

248
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,230
He looks so perplexed.

249
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,770
He couldn't refuse.

250
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,750
Yet, has nothing to say to you.

251
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,250
You shouldn't give people 
trouble like that.

252
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,190
Here, nice.

253
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,280
If I were you?

254
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,030
?I'd go see the Finance manager.

255
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,260
That's not easy.

256
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,270
There are procedures to follow.

257
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,150
She's a difficult person to deal with.

258
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,760
Her face is different 
from what you'd imagine from back.

259
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,430
The question and answer 
is totally different.

260
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,250
It was just so shocking.

261
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,740
I'm told she's a great person though.

262
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,470
She's practical and open-minded.

263
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,410
She listens to the newbies too.

264
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,050
Mr. Oh also said she's quite flexible.

265
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,410
Don?t be so careless 
about others' business.

266
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,750
I understand.

267
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,990
It could be something that can't 
be shared with you, Geu Rae.

268
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,290
Procedures could be much more 
important than you think.

269
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,070
Since they're a type of promise.

270
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,550
Most people trust in, prepare for, 
plan, and execute that promise.

271
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,150
I hope people who rely on 
those promises aren't fooled.

272
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,770
Let's do it.

273
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,070
Young Yi.

274
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,530
I'll just do it.

275
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,190
They might like the newbie's vigor.

276
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,190
Ok.

277
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,130
I agree with that.

278
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,160
Here.

279
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,970
Get out.

280
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,040
Huh?

281
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,710
Can't you see I'm working?

282
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,810
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,310
You're newbie Ahn Young Yi 
in Resources Dev. Team 1?

284
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,310
Yes.

285
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,010
I don't know what you 
want to ask me directly,

286
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,230
skipping your direct bosses
but that's not right.

287
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,570
Your bosses will get in trouble, right?

288
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,950
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,160
Get out.

290
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,540
I told you not to go.

291
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,210
Who do you think you are?

292
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,310
You went there looking all proud.

293
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,450
You're not crying, are you?

294
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,030
Hey.

295
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,230
What's she doing?

296
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,010
[You've got mail 
from Ahn Young Yi.]

297
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,530
If you're late, you're late.

298
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,960
Why the excuses?

299
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Just forget it.

300
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,930
Come to my office.

301
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,950
Don't say sorry, just 
don't make mistakes.

302
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,750
I'm going see the Finance manager.

303
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,670
What?

304
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:26,970
Come in.

305
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,450
Thanks for the apology 
email, that was wonderful.

306
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,850
I like people who acknowledge 
their mistakes.

307
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,990
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,610
You're working on the 
carbon emission item?

309
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,190
-Yes.
-Why?

310
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,210
You know Finance has put it 
on hold for 1.5 years, right?

311
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,490
Yes, I do.

312
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,870
Did your team ask the 
newbie to revive it?

313
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,770
Why?

314
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,550
This is our review data 
regarding the item.

315
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:15,350
Submit a report on why you think

316
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,570
we turned it down by tomorrow.

317
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,290
Why?

318
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,770
I think it's a fair offer for 
a newbie who ignored procedures.

319
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,700
Yes, ma'am.

320
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,970
Make sure I can see it first 
thing tomorrow morning.

321
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,240
Yes.

322
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,850
From our point of view...

323
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,650
I'll submit a report 
from Finance's viewpoint

324
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,950
as well as another report on the issue.

325
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,580
Dang Finance manager?

326
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,080
She must've heard of Young Yi's rumors.

327
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,170
You know what she's like.

328
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,020
I'm sure she's delighted, looking 
back on her newbie days.

329
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,930
I'll see you tomorrow.

330
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,130
Bye.

331
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,250
I'll take the year's 
difference into consideration.

332
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,670
I'll review, edit, and resubmit it.

333
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,290
Yes, I've rechecked it, it'll be fine.

334
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,750
You're working late and drinking coffee?

335
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,130
You should have dinner.

336
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,130
You're leaving for the day?

337
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,870
Yes.
Though it's embarrassing.

338
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,030
It can't be as bad as what happened 
to me and the Finance manager.

339
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,850
Wow, so you're doing it.

340
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,370
We don?t know yet.

341
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,210
I can revise it only when 
I know why it was rejected.

342
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,530
I still don't know yet.

343
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,730
I bought this when I was 
buying hangover tonic.

344
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,550
Since a scar won't matter much.

345
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,370
You'll just scratch the scab off.

346
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,730
Thanks.

347
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,630
Hang in there.

348
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,280
You want to take a break?

349
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,270
Sorry for egging you on.

350
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,530
I think Baek Ki is right.

351
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,490
I think it worked out for the best.

352
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,610
You need to kick the 
ball to make a goal.

353
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,790
That's true.

354
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,190
We're both suffering 
because of items on hold.

355
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,260
Actually, Mr. Kim dissuaded Mr. Oh.

356
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,690
Since it was decided on by 
upper management already.

357
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,290
I wonder how Mr. Oh is 
planning on pulling it off.

358
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,930
He wants to visit all the 
executives and pursuade them.

359
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,730
Rethink it from the other's point 
of view and make it happen.

360
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,250
I think that's his unique strategy.

361
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,310
What?

362
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,350
Your team?

363
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,290
?seems tight.

364
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,150
Rethink it from the other's point 
of view and make it happen?

365
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,870
Make it happen?

366
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,860
I was imprudent.

367
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,700
It's not going well?

368
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,930
I have no clue.

369
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,510
I could've written something fancy, 
but I didn't want to be deceptive.

370
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,990
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,890
I apologize again.

372
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,810
I'm disappointed.

373
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:29,980
I thought since you spent that much 
time, you'd come to a fruitful conclusion.

374
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,310
Regardless of not being able to 
write it, I thought about something.

375
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,360
Yeah?

376
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,790
I think from each dept.'s point of view,

377
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,150
the interpretation of the 
proposal could be different.

378
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,690
When Sales says there's potential,

379
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,490
Finance could interpret 
it as needing further review.

380
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,190
Similarly, "positive response"

381
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,270
could be interpreted as "nothing 
has been decided yet."

382
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,240
And?

383
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,210
Learning about Finance's mechanism 
regarding business budget administration

384
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,030
was the biggest benefit for me.

385
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,790
The abstract estimated 
profits in my head

386
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:12,250
are reevaluated with 
solid grounds by Finance.

387
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,130
There are businesses you can 
still pursue and others you can't.

388
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:21,370
Also, the fact that 
the judgment is classified.

389
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,200
[On hold]

390
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,770
[Grade A]

391
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,400
[Grade B]

392
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,070
[Grade C]

393
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,200
[Returned]

394
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,700
If my proposals go on 
hold or get rejected,

395
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,670
I won't think about what went wrong,

396
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,150
but what I didn't satisfy.

397
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,950
That's better than the report.

398
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,410
You can return.

399
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,220
I'll think about the penalty.

400
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,220
Yes.

401
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,150
What was your major?

402
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,330
Political science, ma'am.

403
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,690
It suits you.

404
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,460
-Did you study accounting on your own?
-I'm studying now.

405
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,000
Ok, hurry up and learn it.

406
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,590
Accounting is a language of management.

407
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,770
Thank you.

408
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm impressed.

409
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,050
Baek Ki, is the Excel file ready?

410
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,760
Here you go.

411
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,350
Come here.

412
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,390
Is there a problem?

413
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,950
I did it as you told me with the data?

414
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,950
What's with this new format?

415
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,890
Haven't you been trained 
about our format?

416
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,530
If you can check the data, 
I'll revise it later?

417
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,430
You know I'm really busy.

418
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,330
Who told you to do as you please?

419
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,530
Baek Ki.

420
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,170
Don't you know the order?

421
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,230
Confirming data?

422
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,730
That's basic and you want 
me to waste my time here?

423
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,710
You input data and 
then revise the format.

424
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,130
What company uses that process?

425
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,990
You can leave now if you want 
to work for another company.

426
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,450
A client meeting 
regarding the Iran item.

427
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,610
It started late because 
of their team's morning meeting

428
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,330
and there are differences in opinions.

429
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,330
Let's try to make things work out.

430
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,390
I have to make a report
 to Mr. Oh by noon

431
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,730
and Mr. Kim has to meet a buyer at noon.

432
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,350
So we're in a hurry.

433
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,390
We just scanned through the points to 
check and left the client's office.

434
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,910
Iran's situation is challenging 
but I hope they improve.

435
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,190
We need to review the documents 
if circumstances change, right?

436
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,190
Why, you think they will?

437
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,690
I don't know.

438
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,930
It is a dilemma.

439
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,270
We're not sure if it's  
a positive or negative situation,

440
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,650
but Mr. Oh thinks it's positive.

441
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,440
I hope he has a solution.

442
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,150
I'll get going.

443
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,050
Bye.

444
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,570
I don't have time to check this again.

445
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:39,090
I'm sure it's fine since 
conditions haven't changed much.

446
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,490
You should recheck it 
if you feel uneasy.

447
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,890
You felt uneasy during the meeting?

448
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,110
I think you should check 
if you feel uneasy.

449
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,970
Just like you had a good feeling,

450
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,840
you should check if you don't.

451
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,730
Sorry, sir.

452
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,470
There's something further to check, 
so I'll make a report later.

453
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,250
Yes, sorry.

454
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,330
Nothing's changed, right?

455
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,450
Yes, it's identical.

456
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,630
Necessary changes have been made.

457
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,890
I'm sorry.

458
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,810
I just wasted your time.

459
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,070
It's ok.

460
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,470
You know what's risky 
when doing business?

461
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,870
Letting it become a race.

462
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,650
You just keep looking forward.

463
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,390
Then you'll crash into something.

464
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,590
Glad you mentioned that.

465
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,990
-You're still here.
-Hi, Mr. Kim.

466
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,090
Great timing.

467
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,870
Let's go when things are looking good.

468
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,550
Sir.

469
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,250
We'll go make the report.

470
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,420
Bye.

471
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,630
One International?

472
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,720
Huh?

473
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,560
Yes, sir.

474
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,500
It's the Iran employee.

475
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,490
The EU placed an embargo.

476
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,130
Mr. Oh.

477
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,580
You did think the embargo 
could be placed, right?

478
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,010
-Yes.
-What about the long-term duration?

479
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,880
Yes.

480
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,270
Then end of discussion.
Forget it.

481
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,970
We can do it.

482
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,270
How?

483
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,610
The risks due to the long-term 
embargo are so obvious.

484
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,140
You know there will be bigger 
risks and you can do it?

485
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,230
Mr. Oh.

486
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,640
It's not that simple here.

487
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,770
There's no way to bring the oil in.

488
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,790
We can get it in through Turkey.

489
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,370
Where?

490
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,390
It's bordering Iran, they're on good 
terms with Iran and not an EU nation.

491
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,990
Iran is importing a 
considerable amount of energy,

492
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,460
so it won't be easy to 
go with the embargo.

493
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,930
We can buy it through a Turkish company.

494
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,560
There is a company we've 
worked with for a long time.

495
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,970
They're in the country.

496
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,500
There are different 
businesses with Iran too.

497
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,570
There are circumstances, 
but we can make a request to Iran.

498
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,280
Turkey?

499
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,850
What do you think, Risk team?

500
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,920
I like it.

501
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,910
I agree, sir.

502
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,630
We have a solid infra with Turkey.

503
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,390
Cheers!

504
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,690
We just need the executive 
director's approval.

505
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,770
-Ok.
-Just the procedures are left.

506
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,380
Good job, guys.

507
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,370
What's wrong?

508
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,930
I? what?

509
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,270
Oh, you don't look too happy.

510
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,510
No, I am.

511
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,190
What is it?
Tell me.

512
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,530
Will the manager be ok?

513
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,590
He focused on the China item.

514
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,410
We didn't order that.

515
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,640
I ordered it.

516
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,890
The results will soon show

517
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,470
if it's good data

518
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,430
or not.

519
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,180
Hello?

520
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,770
Go with the China item.

521
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,050
Keep this.

522
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,550
They're our team's assets.

523
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,850
Yes.

524
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,470
Let's go.

525
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,520
Where are you going?

526
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,670
Let's eat meat.

527
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,470
We'll have a burner, please.

528
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,590
This is the norm, so 
it's just the beginning.

529
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,170
Up until now, it was a warm up.

530
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,510
Will you leave the theater

531
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,190
only after the trailer?

532
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,010
Mr. Oh.

533
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,010
The burner is hot now.

534
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,550
We should put meat on it.

535
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,990
Just the part of the meat has changed.

536
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,550
Sir, forget about head meat,

537
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,220
please give us premium beef here!

538
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,290
Don't drink it from the bottle.

539
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,030
What was your excuse
 for drinking today?

540
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,280
Nice!

541
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,430
You're always happy alone!

542
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,590
Geez.

543
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,670
Yeah.

544
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,670
I was so happy, I drank.

545
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,510
Can't I drink?

546
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:10,190
I'm going to roast grade A 
premium beef from now on.

547
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,630
Drink up.

548
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,060
With this?

549
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,590
Geez, you must be crazy.

550
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,570
Oh, my!

551
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,270
Hey!
Come here!

552
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,090
What's with you?

553
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,480
I wonder how Mr. Oh felt.

554
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,370
The news articles he had 
collected himself,

555
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,350
numerous memos,

556
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,150
cutting out the changing 
news of the times?

557
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,870
?did he think the same thing as me?

558
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,310
I told them to do it last July.

559
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,270
Mr. Oh started on a new item the very 
next day as if nothing ever happened.

560
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,090
Did you check the 
circumstances with China?

561
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,550
Yes.

562
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,590
I'll check and let you know.

563
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,570
Yes.

564
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,310
I think around August.

565
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,620
[Iran petroleum import]

566
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,170
I have a small box now.

567
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,330
Geu Rae.

568
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,130
Did you collect the reports from 
the economics research center too?

569
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,410
Yes.

570
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:03,970
The more my box fills up, the 
more I will have learned.

571
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,070
Ok, let's gather up.

572
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,350
This spells trouble.

573
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,350
China's situation is so different 
from when we started.

574
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,560
China increased their 
importing product line.

575
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:34,310
They're in charge of 90% of the world's 
market with rare earth resources,

576
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,530
so this will make importing hard.

577
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,240
How come other countries 
don't go into development?

578
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,530
It can really ruin the environment.

579
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,730
That's why China has a quota system.

580
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,170
If you look at today's 
research center report,

581
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,590
it means we should stay low for now.

582
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,670
I think that would be smart.

583
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,020
Mr. Oh.

584
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,530
Do whatever it takes.

585
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,050
I'll back you up.

586
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,030
The situation doesn't look 
like that will cover it.

587
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,750
Business isn't easy.

588
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,050
Everything has variables.

589
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,690
With the Iran item, you ignored 
the international circumstances.

590
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,430
Why are you hesitating now?

591
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,570
You know it was reported in my name.

592
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,670
Don't whine, ok?

593
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,470
Don't pull pranks because 
yours was rejected!

594
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,090
Going forward.

595
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,550
Not yet?

596
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,550
Let's go forward.

597
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,370
Mr. Kim, the report?

598
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,770
Look at this.

599
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,430
They're all saying it's 
a super-cycle trend.

600
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,370
[Super-cycle: Long-term price 
increase trend of over 20 years]

601
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,390
Things aren't looking good.

602
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,970
We'll have to see.

603
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,570
Set a meeting with China tomorrow.

604
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,830
They can come or we go.

605
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,830
We should recheck it.

606
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,730
Reports keep coming in.

607
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,810
The dept. manager used 
to work on this item.

608
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,690
We need to do it and he wants it.

609
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,770
I know, but the circumstances 
have changed.

610
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,550
Yes.

611
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,360
A long time has passed.

612
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,230
Since I brought up 
the item on hold again.

613
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,370
Whether if it's the dept. manager's 
performance results or not,

614
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,070
I'm the one responsible for 
delaying the stable item.

615
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,090
Also, worsened situations 
due to an aggravated environment.

616
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,630
It's our team's responsibility.

617
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,230
If you can't resolve this, 
he'll have a hard time.

618
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,830
We have to do it.

619

[Progress report]

620

Honestly, everyone's climbing 
up the social ladder.

621
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,430
He doesn't care about his 
performance ratings at all.

622
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,410
What we really need to see 
the results at this point.

623
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,330
I mean Mr. Oh needs to be promoted.

624
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,930
Let's do it well.

625
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,570
Of course.

626
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,790
Now I should be able to 
fulfill one man's workload.

627
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,010
You're alone?

628
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,010
Sir.

629
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,170
They're all out?

630
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,970
Yes, they all just left.

631
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,110
Tell Mr. Oh I want to see him.

632
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,250
Sure.

633
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,310
Hey.

634
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,890
It's much riskier than you said.

635
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,230
Don?t you know China has increased 
their business and shifts are being made?

636
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,450
Yes, we're going to supplement that.

637
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:23,190
I'm sure I told you the warnings 
when the first proposal was made.

638
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,410
Among the three items, the one you?

639
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,920
That's not it.

640
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,770
Among the items you brought, I said

641
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,130
"let's try that" about the safest choice.

642
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:38,330
Oh, but the China item 
now was your idea?

643
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,470
It was just an idea.

644
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,490
An idea isn't a proposal.

645
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,750
Is it?

646
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,830
I'll do well so it doesn't 
have a negative effect on you.

647
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,130
Hey.

648
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,110
Who do you think you are?

649
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,950
I'm sorry.

650
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,890
Anyway, go ahead with 
your item, Mr. Oh.

651
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,130
Make reports right away.

652
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,310
Delete the part where 
it says it's my idea.

653
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,790
That's such a minor detail.

654
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,670
Then what about backup 
for the China item?

655
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,450
Don't you have hands to work with?

656
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,810
What backup?

657
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,790
The company is backing you up!

658
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,790
Yes, sir.

659
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,350
Come see me.

660
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,810
Where are you going?

661
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,570
The dept. manager wants to see me.

662
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,050
He wants to see the business 
data out of the blue.

663
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,110
-Why?
-It's obvious.

664
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,170
He wants to take credit.

665
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:57,050
You know with our business 
from the briefing last time.

666
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:02,850
He was blatantly claiming 
your proposal was bad.

667
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,720
Do a better job.

668
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,390
What?

669
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,450
He said you go a different 
direction from what he wants.

670
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,660
Do a better job for him.

671
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,350
You should change things 
for improvement.

672
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,900
Kiss up to the bosses too.

673
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,490
I'm too sorry to get promoted.

674
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,510
Yes!

675
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,170
Mr. Oh, I heard?

676
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,130
Get out.

677
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,900
It better work.

678
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,530
Don?t think of the price and look

679
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,830
into all the companies with 
quota systems.

680
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:03,990
Yes, sir.

681
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,080
Geu Rae.

682
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,610
Go with him.

683
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:13,610
Yes, sir.

684
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,190
We could force it.

685
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,770
But all the companies with quota 
systems have different prices.

686
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,750
You could get blamed for everything.

687
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,940
We're going to change our item too.

688
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,290
Non-quota?

689
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,510
No way, it's smuggling.

690
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,980
People with those baits 
wouldn't be at big companies.

691
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,050
I'm surprised there's 
60% more smuggling.

692
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,710
It's hard to get a big 
quantity without smuggling.

693
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:58,910
Patience is a virtue, but 
our team can't afford that.

694
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,800
-What's Mr. Kim like?
-Who?

695
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,430
The dept. manager.

696
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,790
A typical man earning a salary.

697
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,010
That's what I'd call him.

698
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,970
He's perfect for the times.

699
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,510
He's quick and eloquent.

700
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,310
Very sharp.

701
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,710
What can a company employee look 
forward to besides promotions?

702
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,750
Do you think that's all 
there is to it too?

703
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,450
So far?

704
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,690
Since I haven't found anything else.

705
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,730
Let's save Mr. Oh? 
I mean our team first.

706
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,600
So obnoxious.

707
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,790
Hello.

708
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,540
You should watch where you're going.

709
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,010
Your lower body is weak, huh?

710
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,260
A man's lower body is key, huh?

711
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:36,960
Use the stairs from now on, not this.

712
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,710
Aren't you going?

713
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,130
Huh?

714
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,010
Thanks.

715
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,540
Is your foot ok?

716
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,270
What about my foot?

717
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,430
I told you to come to my team.

718
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,770
You're suffering because you didn't.

719
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,450
The carbon emission item?

720
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,830
I like it.

721
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,270
You can't make it  
a national business, right?

722
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,590
Right.

723
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:29,490
I can't make a profit structure 
that Finance will pass.

724
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,610
When did you learn Russian?

725
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:35,550
You seemed good.

726
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:36,770
In college.

727
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,790
I was an exchange student for an year.

728
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:39,830
What about you?

729
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,330
I lived there for 2 years for work.

730
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:47,090
I learned a lot then because 
I always loved Russian.

731
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:51,130
There's a word for "white 
night" in Russian, you know?

732
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:55,250
You know the ballet dancer 
Mikhail Baryshnikov?

733
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:01,530
I was moved by that movie as a kid 
and vowed to go to Russia someday.

734
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,170
You know their famous theater?

735
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:10,050
Mikhail Baryshnikov is dancing there.

736
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,180
Vladimir Vysotsky sings.

737
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,330
You don't know, right?

738
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,850
He's a famous revolutionary singer.

739
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,270
Like a wild horse.

740
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,010
The Russian culture has tragic beauty.

741
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,990
It's a U.S. film.

742
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,690
-The U.S.?
-Yes.

743
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,060
Not Russian?

744
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:07,270
I got carried away.

745
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:13,230
I heard you left the rare earth 
resource case with the quota system.

746
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,430
Mm-hmm.

747
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,070
Dang.

748
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,510
I didn't know China would be so fickle.

749
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,950
I go there like I drink water.

750
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:27,990
I never had a hunch.

751
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,070
We overlook what we think is obvious.

752
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,990
Tell me about it.

753
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,970
We overlook what we think is obvious?

754
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,330
I better go.

755
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:53,750
Thanks.

756
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:01,710
Use that item?

757
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,410
Thanks, Mr. Oh.

758
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,350
We overlook what we think is obvious?

759
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,980
[North Korea's rare earth resources: 
Estimated at 20,000,000 tons]

760
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,480
Yes, sir.

761
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:36,330
Something new?

762
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:39,030
Yes, there's news.

763
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,460
What is it?

764
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,750
I found a solution for 
the rare earth resources.

765
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:44,690
What?

766
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:48,130
The Korean Resource Corporation is 
developing them with North Korea.

767
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,730
Huh?

768
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:56,310
Estimated at 20,000,000 tons.

769
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:00,190
It will become twentyfold 
once it's official.

770
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:04,710
Set a meeting with the Planning 
dept., your employees should come.

771
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,610
It'll be in an hour.

772
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,710
Yes.

773
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,490
Sir, this?

774
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:15,270
Work on it and I'll see to it 
after I'm done with Sales Team 3.

775
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,790
Weren't you going to 
report with our item?

776
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,210
When did I say I'd do that?

777
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,310
It started out with my item
 from Sales team 3!

778
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,910
But?

779
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,070
Sir, our manager changed his mind.

780
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,180
What's wrong with him?

781
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,250
I'm going crazy.

782
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,130
It's just procedures.

783
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,670
Sales Team 2's item 
will be reported too.

784
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:49,890
That's not the issue.

785
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:53,240
It has to be an item backed by him.

786
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,240
Please pursuade him.

787
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:07,290
I've never had such 
a big meeting before.

788
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:19,360
They're just saying it was for a meeting,

789
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,950
but not acknowledging it officially.

790
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,400
Connect hotlines to the research 
centers, government depts.

791
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,590
and the public corporation.

792
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,670
Check and review the content.

793
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,850
The planning team uses 
connections to secure the latest info.

794
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,250
Yes.

795
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,850
This isn't the time for management.

796
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,950
Yes, we're looking for
 the right timing politically.

797
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,350
The collected info is made

798
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,910
orderly by Mr. Oh and Mr. Kim.

799
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,770
Rare earth resource stocks are shaky.

800
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:52,010
Of course, all the meeting 
content is recorded.

801
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,750
That's my job.

802
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,670
Your team should submit  
a progress report twice a day.

803
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,270
-Yes.
-That's all for today.

804
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:05,150
Thank you.

805
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,470
Thanks.

806
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,250
Sir.

807
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,010
Hello.

808
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,080
Hello.

809
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,910
Hello.

810
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,090
What is it?

811
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,890
Do you have time this evening?

812
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:20,730
You have something to say?

813
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,470
Let's eat together.

814
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,650
Shall we?

815
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,330
I have two hours.

816
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,030
This is too much.

817
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,550
Don?t worry about it.

818
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,890
Mr. Kim was set on our item.

819
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,980
He wants to change his mind.

820
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:51,450
I mean regarding promotion and 
all, it's totally your timing.

821
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,170
This is too much.

822
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,570
-Mr. Lee.
-Organize this.

823
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,830
Don't worry about that.

824
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,470
Geu Rae, get the minutes 
ready and send it.

825
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:00,730
Yes.

826
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:03,630
How long does it take?

827
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,470
I said use simple keywords!

828
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:09,700
Sales Team 2's screams were desperate.

829
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:13,710
What can a company employee look 
forward to besides promotions?

830
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:16,810
Delete this, make it work!

831
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,690
You think this will?

832
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,450
Nothing is simple.

833
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:21,820
Will you think?

834
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,690
Mr. Kang is good.

835
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,070
The Finance team can't complain.

836
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,680
He's perfect.

837
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,090
Of course, he's great in other aspects.

838
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,410
What?

839
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:08,930
You want to have a drink?

840
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,440
Aren't you going to leave?

841
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,070
Wrap up now.

842
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,290
Yes.

843
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,190
Check if it's accurate.

844
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,610
Yes, sir.

845
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,610
I can't believe this.

846
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:06,910
What's with your expression?

847
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,610
Another mistake?

848
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,520
We'll have to add to the 
next sales proposal.

849
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,790
So annoying.

850
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:15,950
What is it?

851
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:18,730
What is this?

852
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:22,070
The Korean carbon emission 
item with the Russian forest?

853
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,550
Is this possible?

854
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:26,450
It seems so.

855
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:32,390
This? sounds ok.

856
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,310
Finance will pass it.

857
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,870
I know.

858
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,690
Now I get it.

859
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:42,910
You said Mr. Cho in 
Fabric is the scariest.

860
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,470
I'm scared too.

861
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,570
I hate it!

862
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:48,650
Right?

863
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,170
I don't care!

864
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,560
Let's go before we're late.

865
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,770
Yes.

866
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,490
You know where to come to eat, right?

867
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,790
Did it go well?

868
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,370
I think it went well.

869
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:42,450
The research with the market trends.

870
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:43,970
-I like it.
-Yes.

871
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,830
The completed item is fine.

872
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:49,970
I'm saying, let's think 
of it as decided.

873
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:52,430
Mr. Oh is creating a business.

874
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,830
Let's cheer him on.

875
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,070
Sir.

876
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,450
There is much to work on.

877
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,230
Decided?

878
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:03,230
You should get this 
for your business.

879
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,290
Geez.

880
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,730
Sir.

881
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,200
Call Mr. Oh.

882
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,150
Why in the restaurant 
where Mr. Ko is eating?

883
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,150
Sir.

884
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:30,790
Hi.

885
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:32,660
What?

886
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,230
Your whole team is here?

887
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:49,130
Here, have a glass each.

888
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:50,430
Yes.

889
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,090
Let's make things simple.

890
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,850
I'll go with Team 2's item first.

891
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,710
Thank you!

892
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:13,660
Yes.

893
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,670
We'll increase the size.

894
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:22,510
Since we have to wait for the outcome 
about the relations with the North anyway.

895
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,780
Let's prepare and make it big.

896
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:28,410
Resource businesses should be huge.

897
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,010
Yes, sir.

898
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:31,310
Happy?

899
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:32,970
Yes.

900
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:34,190
Yes!

901
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,310
Ok, let's drink.

902
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,620
Cheers.

903
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,960
Cheers!

904
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,990
Hurray, Mr. Kim!

905
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,110
Great choice.

906
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,250
Sir!

907
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,510
What brings you here?

908
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,390
Our Resource Development team is here.

909
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:59,450
Yes.

910
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:01,080
I heard a familiar voice.

911
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,310
So I peeked in.

912
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,480
We were having dinner too.

913
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,610
What a loud dinner.

914
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,790
Looking good.

915
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,250
Yes.

916
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,190
[North Korea rare earth resources 
business - Sales Team 3]

917
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,650
Wait.

918
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,890
Can I see that?

919
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,110
Yes.

920
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:21,790
Rare earth resource?

921
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,390
Yes.

922
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,330
Why is Sales Team 3 dealing 
with the Resource team's item?

923
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,490
It's the Resource team's item.

924
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,510
-Look.
-Yes.

925
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,270
You mentioned rare earth 
resources last time.

926
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,950
Oh, yes.

927
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,450
I was going to submit a proper report.

928
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:47,010
The Resource team should do it.

929
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:48,150
Mr. Kim.

930
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,890
It overlaps, so why not combine them?

931
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,390
Yes.

932
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:04,010
Why suffer when there are pros?

933
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,630
Find something that suits Sales Team 3.

934
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:10,450
It's on me, so enjoy your time.

935
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,490
Find something that suits you.

936
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,750
Let's go.

937
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,790
Mr. Kim.

938
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,890
Sit over here.

939
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,150
Take your time.

940
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,350
Let's go, Mr. Ko.

941
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,750
Yes.

942
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:51,950
Yes.

943
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,690
Sir.

944
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,050
Sir.

945
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,370
Let's eat.

946
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:13,650
I'm hungry.

947
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:36,750
We started eating without a word.

948
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:41,270
We were suddenly starving.

949
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:44,130
We had to eat something.

950
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,910
I learned why we had to get drunk.

951
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:56,630
And?

952
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:03,590
?I can't comfort anyone,
 as a newbie.?

953
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,310
?I'm sorry.

954
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,570
She'll kill me.

955
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:38,630
She must've changed the number.

956
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,090
What time is it now?

957
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,210
Geez.

958
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,830
Gosh.

959
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:15,590
Honey, lights. Light!

960
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:21,270
It's on.

961
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:23,270
Is it bright now?

962
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,630
Why do you drink every day?

963
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,710
Every single day!

964
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:32,090
Can't you stop drinking?

965
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,770
No.

966
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,830
Why not?

967
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:39,400
Because it's tasty.

968
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,740
What?

969
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,950
Do you know that taste?

970
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:53,050
Dang.

971
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:15,270
Do you guys know that taste?

972
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:21,350
Do you?
