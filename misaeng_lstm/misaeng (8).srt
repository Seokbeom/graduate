affects you for so long,

00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
Drink it.

188
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,670
Huh?

189
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,440
If we get food poisoning, 
he can't make us do it.

190
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Mr. Oh!

191
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,680
Drink it.

192
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,260
How can we drink this?

193
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,100
Drink it.

194
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,050
You have to.

195
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,220
Ok.

196
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,520
You still have some.

197
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,300
Man.

198
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,440
Is it coming out?

199
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,620
No, it was dirty.

200
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,540
I'm not getting any signals.

201
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,880
Me neither.

202
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,680
Are you sure it was expired?

203
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,320
Yes, I'm sure, sir.

204
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,240
Is your stomach fine too, Mr. Oh?

205
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,960
Dang lactic acid bacteria!

206
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,020
He said "principle."

207
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,270
Principle.

208
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,720
Work is everything for us,

209
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,540
so I wonder what principle 
could possibly go against it.

210
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,040
Is there such a thing?

211
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,880
Yes, Sales Team 3, Oh Sang Sik.

212
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,400
Hello.

213
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,060
This is Madam Cha at Jangwon.

214
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,100
We had our grand opening in Shinsa-dong.

215
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,070
I called to say hi.

216
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,570
Why are you calling this office?

217
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,120
Jangwon?

218
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,720
Oh Sang Sik speaking.

219
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,540
- Hello, Mr. Oh Sang Sik.
- Kim Dong Sik speaking.

220
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,020
We've renovated our 
place in Bangbae-dong.

221
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,920
Not interested.

222
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,550
I'll tell him.

223
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,780
-Geez.
-I'll call you back.

224
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,400
Yes, sir.

225
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,680
It's Mr. Lee from a luxury 
lounge in Seocho-dong.

226
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,440
-He said he'd give you a 20% discount.
-Hey!

227
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,390
Rumors must've spread, last 
time with the IT Sales team...

228
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,500
Excuse me.

229
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,440
Are you Mr. Oh Sang Sik?

230
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,180
Yes, I am.

231
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,940
I'm Michelle Jang of 
Partners Cooperation.

232
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,460
I want to be your business partner.

233
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,040
But what is?

234
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,130
Ms. Bae.

235
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,870
You'll be doing business with CEO

236
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,740
Mr. Mun in the Arab, correct?

237
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,480
We sealed the contract last year

238
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,050
entertaining him with Sales Team 1.

239
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,300
You can ignore all 
the calls you've received.

240
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,560
Partners Cooperation will 
be your best partner.

241
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,730
From limousine pickup service,

242
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,500
to any service the VIP wants.

243
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,470
We'll satisfy all your needs.

244
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,840
Of course,

245
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,340
round 2 also, satisfaction guaranteed.

246
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,190
Just overlook it 
this time, buddy. Ok?

247
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,480
Don't you feel sorry for Dong Sik?

248
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,280
His face looks like a sick chicken now.

249
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,500
What?

250
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,780
Mr. Kim promised to get 
you more people, right?

251
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,940
Geez.

252
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,860
Mun Chung Gi making a dirty 
mess at the bar is one thing.

253
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,400
There's a reason Mr. Oh 
hates entertaining him.

254
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,660
He's always wants round 2.

255
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,150
Round 2?

256
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,500
It's illegal, of course.

257
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,660
Some buyers want that even these days.

258
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,870
Mr. Oh won't do it because of his 
principles, not just the laws.

259
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,940
Principles.

260
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,860
So what do you mean?

261
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,600
Well, he told me a few times.

262
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,980
So, it has to do
 with human rights.

263
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,580
Human dignity something?

264
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,060
So I can't explain it.

265
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,720
Mr. Oh's principle is he won't

266
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,000
ever entertain them with round 2.

267
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,040
So he puts people above work?

268
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,480
Right.

269
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,680
It's so frustrating.

270
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,540
Honestly, this is a team effort, and 
there's no such thing as principles.

271
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,460
You do what you have to.

272
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,360
If we just pull this off,

273
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,720
this quarter's performance will be good.

274
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,540
Eat it.

275
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,550
I'm good.

276
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,940
Hello, Mr. Oh.

277
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
Hey.

278
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,920
What are you worried about?

279
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,380
-Just finish with round 1.
-What?

280
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,480
Get him drunk and sign 
the deal, it's simple.

281
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
He'll be down with round 1.

282
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,380
The Mecca Phone item 
is a headache, right?

283
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,600
I know everything.

284
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,160
I want to help you since 
I'm smart regarding that area.

285
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Unfortunately, I'm so busy myself.

286
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,610
Baek Ki!

287
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,600
Hey!

288
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,350
I want to help him too.

289
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,460
There's no solution.

290
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,780
I hope he doesn't get different ideas.

291
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,040
[Task: Mark order, organize 
order, mark "-"?]

292
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,840
[Order]

293
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,200
[Mark "-"]

294
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,300
You can leave now if you want

295
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,780
to work at a different company.

296
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,940
I'm Lee Ji Hyun at headhunting 
firm, Search & Brains.

297
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,520
I'd like to recommend good companies

298
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,780
if you're thinking of changing jobs.

299
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,540
Great timing.

300
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,220
Hey, about the carbon emission item.

301
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,310
[Carbon emission allowance: Right to emit 
a certain amount of six greenhouse gases]

302
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,680
Finance gave approval.

303
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,190
The day has finally come.

304
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,720
Whose business shall we make it?

305
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,760
Let's make it yours.

306
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,240
It was originally your plan.

307
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,380
Young Yi just added Russian photos.

308
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,900
She made the crucial hit.

309
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,200
So, do it together.

310
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,800
Huh?

311
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,300
-No, she can do it herself.
-Why, you!

312
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,840
That's absurd.

313
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,910
She's smart, but still a newbie.

314
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,120
She can't do it alone.

315
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,760
I can't work with her!

316
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,120
Hey!

317
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,450
You think I want to give her work?

318
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,880
This could be a big success.

319
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,100
Think of the team!

320
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,000
Finance gave approval?

321
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,420
Yeah.

322
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,760
Good job.

323
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,860
Thanks.

324
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,720
Mr. Ha's in charge, so support him well.

325
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,670
Ok, I'll do my best.

326
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,170
-Sir.
-Let's talk.

327
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,620
Tell him you can't do it.

328
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,680
Huh?

329
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,380
Don't feign ignorance.

330
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,840
You thought I'd want to work with you?

331
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,620
I'll support you well.

332
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,530
Hey, don't you get it?

333
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,100
"I'll support you well"?

334
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,080
You want to act cool to the end?

335
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,200
-Sir?
-Tell him you can't do it.

336
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,620
If you're a part of our team,

337
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,510
don't cause any more trouble!

338
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,120
Don't you feel sorry for Dong Sik?

339
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,220
His face looks like a sick chicken now.

340
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,320
One International, 
Kim Dong Sik speaking.

341
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,060
Yes, hello.

342
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,600
Yes.

343
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,310
I'm not sure about that matter.

344
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,980
I'll check and call you back.

345
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,980
Yes.
Bye.

346
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,820
Mr. Kim.

347
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,860
Yes.

348
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,240
Mr. Kim promised to get 
you more people, right?

349
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,600
Dong Sik!

350
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,560
Yes?

351
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,660
Let's do it!

352
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,370
Yes.

353
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,500
Huh?

354
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,960
Let's do it.

355
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,270
Do it!

356
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,680
Let's do it!

357
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,280
I'll seal the deal by round 1.

358
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,240
Geu Rae.

359
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,780
Tell Suk Yool to come.

360
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,880
I'll start now.

361
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
This is the entertainment strategy 
for Mecca Phone CEO Mun Chung Gi.

362
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,090
His trade insurance 
corporation grade is A.

363
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,060
-His occupation?
-I know,

364
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
that's not important.

365
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,030
This is the list of people who 
failed to sign the contract with him.

366
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,280
They have one thing in common.

367
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,740
They all couldn't or wouldn't 
entertain him with round 2.

368
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,120
When they did have round 2,

369
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,680
they all signed the deal,

370
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,300
or had a positive response.

371
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,210
-None of them signed after round 1?
-No.

372
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,360
Ok, what's the possibility he'll

373
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,840
sign it when he's drunk after round 1?

374
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,800
The answer is, we don't know.

375
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,960
He's never been dead drunk.

376
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,760
Let's say he happened to get hammered.

377
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,060
He's laid-back,

378
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,680
liberal, and a big bluff.

379
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,870
[Can you withstand Mun's 
alcohol tolerance?]

380
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,940
He might feel good,

381
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,380
so it could be possible.

382
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,770
-That's the alternative we have for now.
-Ok.

383
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,970
Like I said before, the problem is

384
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,610
he's never been hammered.

385
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,910
How's his tolerance?

386
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,620
For a 40% degrees whiskey?

387
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,840
He has to have three
 bottles of 40% degrees

388
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,960
whiskeys within 1.5 hours to get drunk.

389
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,620
So it's a bottle per 
hour, just make it simple.

390
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,820
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,460
We must get him to sign by round 1.

392
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,500
We can't get drunk first.

393
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,600
Sorry I'm late.

394
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,710
Things ran late.

395
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,260
[Operation plan: Victory!]

396
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,290
The seating is key.

397
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,230
Mr. Oh will sit here and Mr. Kim 
on the opposite side.

398
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,030
Geu Rae will sit next to Mr. Kim.

399
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,700
Mr. Mun will sit 
in the seat of honor?

400
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,020
Young Yi.

401
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,300
Sorry.

402
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,570
Glad you're here, Young Yi.

403
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
- Later.
- Mr. Oh.

404
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,980
Mr. Oh.

405
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,750
Sit down.

406
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,420
This is Mr. Mun.

407
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,340
She can't be him.

408
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,660
Aren't you busy?

409
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,240
I am, excuse me.

410
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,620
Sit down.

411
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,400
Mr. Oh will pour Mr. Mun a drink.

412
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,180
Next you will, Mr. Kim.

413
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,930
While he's drinking, 
Mr. Oh? excuse me.

414
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,480
You'll act like you're taking 
a phone call and leave.

415
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,720
-In this chaotic moment? Geu Rae.
-Huh?

416
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,280
Then you go.

417
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,260
So, he's drinking three 
shots while we drink one?

418
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,850
-Yes.
-Good idea.

419
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,040
But,

420
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
this can't last forever.

421
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,720
Prepare two bottles of 
whiskey from the get-go.

422
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,890
One is real and one is black tea.

423
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,680
After Mr. Mun pours all of you a drink,

424
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,520
Geu Rae pours him one.

425
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,580
Mr. Kim will then change it 
with a shot of black tea.

426
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,340
Wet towels and trashcans to throw 
out the alcohol are essential here.

427
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,200
You act like you're drinking 
it, then you spit it out.

428
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,380
The wet towel can't absorb too much,

429
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,460
so if you spit it out before 
absorption, it will get messy.

430
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,000
The key to the trick 
is the absorption.

431
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So keep many dry towels 
similar to the wet one.

432
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,880
You need to put empty 
glasses in your pocket.

433
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,580
To change them with full shots.

434
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,980
You need to act drunk

435
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,980
and remember to call each other 
every 30 minutes to rotate seats.

436
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,120
Boilermakers are seven times 
as strong as normal alcohol.

437
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,250
Learn how to make them, 
it'll make things exciting.

438
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,280
See, now you get it?

439
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,420
Why I kept saying we needed her?

440
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,560
I've tasted 40 types of alcohol 
including loyal alchohol,

441
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,340
rainbow alcohol, gold liquor, 
and cappuccino liquor.

442
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Ok, Geu Rae.

443
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,480
Learn how to make boilermakers from him.

444
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,060
Thanks.

445
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,700
Let's go.

446
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,440
Learn it.

447
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,810
Who are you, Young Yi?

448
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,510
Principle?

449
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,460
Why are you laughing?

450
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,860
I feel like looking at an old

451
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,690
watch in an antique store.

452
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,990
Huh?

453
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,560
The word "principle."

454
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,480
Nowadays, college professors 
who mention

455
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,520
"social justice" get the same response.

456
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,620
Mr. Oh still has it.

457
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,650
Or he's struggling to 
keep his soul alive.

458
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,180
Mr. Oh?

459
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,620
You really won't prepare round 2?

460
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,270
-Mr. Oh, what if?
-No!

461
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,510
Get all the info you can 
about Mun including receipts.

462
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,840
Why you, I'll do whatever it takes

463
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,960
to make you sign it by round 1.

464
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,500
Give me the revised agency list.

465
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,320
Stand there and 
I'll tell you what to fix.

466
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,740
Good job, it looks fine.

467
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,880
Do this too.

468
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,840
They're contract documents.

469
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,880
Check for typos, any mistakes,

470
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,660
and make sure I can mail it
 by noon tomorrow.

471
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,090

472
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,660

475

What are you doing?

476
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,900
I came to create business.

477
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,140
I didn't come here to make charts,

478
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,180
check typos, and balance accounts.

479
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,310
I've done enough of those 
tedious tasks as an intern.

480
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,480
I don't think they're 
for me to do anymore.

481
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,980
Can't you see how other 
team newbies are working?

482
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,360

next sales proposal, even Geu?

483
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,540

485
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,520
Haven't you learned anything so far?

486
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,040
All I've learned is patience.

487
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,840
I think it's time 
to apply what I've learned.

488
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,150
Put that back on his desk.

489
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,280

490
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,520
Don't need to console me.

491
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,580
Why's he so angry?

492

-Yes.

premium beef, join us.

might go without him.

Sorry if it was?

513
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,160

-Young Yi.

and think of you as a savior?

548
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,220
We've all been on 
stand-by for two hours.

549
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,900
My men are? ready too.

550
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,460
Yes, let's do it.

551
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,810
He's here.

552
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,200
He has finally come.

553
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,840
Principles are laughed 
at in this day and age.

554
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
How was your flight?

555
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,500
Good.

556
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,840
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mun.

557
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm Oh Sang Sik of One 
International Sales Team 3.

558
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,350
He's the guy who made Mr. Oh 
bring up that old word.

559
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,050
I'm Kim Dong Sik.

560
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,860
I'm Jang Geu Rae.

561
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,480
This way, please.

562
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,480
Ok.

563
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,260
Will Mr. Oh be able to keep 
his principle as intended?

564
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,710
Wow.

565
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,220
The match was over 
sooner than we thought.

566
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,620
Sir, I'll pour you a drink.

567
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,360
We had a different operation 
location to work with.

568
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,440
We panicked even before 
we could load our guns.

569
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,240
Oh.
Excuse me.

570
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,300
Hello?

571
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,520
Hold on.
Hello?

572
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,410
Hold on?
Hello?

573
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,720
Mr. Oh.

574
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,220
The most meticulous plan in the history

575
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,440
of alcohol entertainment with clients,

576
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,800
was ruined before it even started

577
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,740
in front of the heaviest 
drinker on earth.

578
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,940
Here.

579
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,500
Ok.

580
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,000
The boilermaker recipe I learned

581
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,400
-at the last minute was useless.
-This is a water fountain.

582
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,570
Wow.

583
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,600
Round 2!

584
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,820
Round 2!

585
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,400
We will party till the 
break of dawn, here you go.

586
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,820
Ok.

587
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,750
Mr. Kim couldn't tell which was

588
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,360
whiskey and which was black tea.

589
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,440
Mr. Oh was still struggling to get

590
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,640
the contract signed by round 1.

591
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,760
Here's me.

592
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,170
We realized when the clock 
hit 4:00 in the morning.

593
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,240
We had totally failed.

594
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,800
Mr. Oh's heart will

595
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,480
cry a river of tears all night.

596
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,340
Hey.

597
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,490
41 59//Our youngest one, right?

598
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,520
Geu Rae.

599
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,830
You can go now.

600
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,540
You're quick, Mr. Oh.

601
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,400
Ok, go home.

602
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,380
Wait!

603
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,480
What's with it?

604
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,900
I don't have time for this.

605
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,490
Please, sir!

606
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,720
Don't worry!

607
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,720
You too, don't worry.

608
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,280
Good job.

609
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,300
Where's Dong Sik?

610
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,620
Dong Sik.

611
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,220
Dong Sik!

612
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,340
-Dude!
-Get up...

613
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,040
Send Dong Sik home.

614
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,600
You go home too.

615
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,640
Get a couple of hours of sleep.

616
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,340
What? about you?

617
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,540
Dang.

618
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,180
Wait.

619
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,780
Mr. Oh failed,

620
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,360
but Sales Team 3 survived.

621
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,980
"Survived" my foot, 
we were in trouble.

622
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,280
Big trouble!

623
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,450
Huh?

624
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,950
We're in big trouble.

625
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,200
How could that happen?

626
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,400
You're awake.

627
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,020
You're surprised?

628
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,440
How? did you?

629
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,660
I sent her there.

630
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,360
Mr. Oh.

631
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,800
That quenches my thirst so well.

632
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,070
Mr. Oh.

633
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,560
Man.

634
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,640
You thought I'd do 
whatever he wants?

635
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,980
You sent his wife?

636
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,500
It's all in the data.

637
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,600
Data research is always crucial.

638
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,580
The key is in the data.

639
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,870
In some of the economy 
news on Mun Chung Gi,

640
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,060
they said he'd be 
arriving with his wife.

641
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,220
I happened to see his anniversary.

642
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,540
[Romantist of the distribution 
field, Mun Chung Gi]

643
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,440
It happened to be the same 
day we were entertaining him.

644
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,850
[Wedding anniversary]

645
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,850
That made my blood boil for a minute.

646
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,420
Huh?

647
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,200
He was going to screw 
around on his anniversary.

648
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:05,080
Ideas boiled in my 
head at the same time.

649
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,800
Regarding the round 2 
readiness you mentioned.

650
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,740
I'm sure I said preparations, 
not readiness.

651
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,440
I wanted to give his poor wife

652
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,700
an unforgettable anniversary gift.

653
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,240
I met her on the morning of that day

654
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,480
and told her about our gift for her.

655
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
You mean "your" gift.

656
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,040
Then everything happened 
perfectly after that.

657
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
We failed perfectly, you mean.

658
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,140
How could this happen?

659
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,600
Gosh!

660
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,600
What guy would want to be 
entertained by his wife?

661
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,700
So you chose your principle

662
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,740
instead of the contract.

663
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,970
What will you tell Mr. Kim?

664
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,660
Dang, you're crazy!

665
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,940
Are you insane?

666
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,320
Sang Sik, you might as 
well jump off a bridge!

667
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,620
As long as I'm in headquarters,

668
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,040
you will never get more people!

669
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,960
I told you before.

670
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,960
Repair the damages made 
by all the sales headquarters!

671
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,860
All of it!

672
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,100
Everything!

673
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,050
Gosh.

674
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,460
Hello?

675
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,720
Dad!

676
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,340
My baby, future tradingman!

677
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,580
Dad, are you coming home early tonight?

678
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,600
Yeah.

679
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,360
Then buy some spicy chicken on the way.

680
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,070
Just spicy chicken?

681
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,480
What about fried chicken?

682
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,610
Then make it fried.

683
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,120
Only fried chicken?

684
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,440
What about spicy?

685
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,460
Then buy half and half.

686
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,780
Then shall I buy two half-half chickens?

687
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,600
Then you can just buy 
one spicy and one fried.

688
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,980
Right.

689
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,900
You're dumb, Dad!

690
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,080
Hey, don't call your dad dumb.

691
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,060
I love you, Dad. 
Bye!

692
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,640
I love you.

693
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,240
Oh, gosh.

694
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,340
I feel so down.

695
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,900
Blood, dang?

696
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,690
Dad,

697
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:43,780
Buy one half-half and one spicy.

698
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,160
From your No. 1 son.

699
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,020
You were here?
You weren't picking up your phone.

700
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,640
You had a nosebleed?

701
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,210
Yeah.

702
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,440
Are you ok?

703
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,660
I dozed off for a few minutes.

704
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,280
Now I'm bleeding.

705
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,060
You dozed off?

706
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,350
I don?t know if  
I dozed off or fainted.

707
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,430
Maybe my blood pressure 
rose because of fatigue.

708
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,040
I'm ok.

709
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,780
Don't tell Dong Sik anything.

710
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,380
I don't want to hear him nag.

711
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,240
Young Yi.

712
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,060
Yes.

713
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,460
Why are you looking
 at the EU-ETS data?

714
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,630
[EU-ETS: European Union 
Emission Trading Scheme]

715
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,080
What are you trying to do?

716
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,680
What do you take me for?

717
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,060
I told you to butt out.

718
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,720
You're trying to get on my nerves?

719
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,780
You're saying it's yours 
and you have the right?

720
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,480
That's not it, sir.

721
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,180
If you can't drop it?

722
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,400
Fine, take it.

723
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
I don't have to do it.

724
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:19,020
Put your frigging name in 
the center and succeed!

725
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,620
Young Yi.

726
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,640
Suk Yool.

727
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,120
Keep your chin up.

728
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,380
Everyone knows losers act like that.

729
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,280
Guys can be the biggest losers.

730
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,920
More so around talented women.

731
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,060
Be strong since you're not at fault.

732
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,080
When you pulled off the 
2-year-old item as an intern,

733
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,380
rumors of your legendary 
talent spread everywhere.

734
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,160
Go back to that Young Yi.

735
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,920
Keep your chin up and be proud.

736
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,340
Be strong.

737
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,940
That's more like you.

738
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,960
What?

739
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,220
I'll do as you said.

740
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,220
As you said, I'll keep out of it.

741
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,340
I'll run your errands

742
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,140
while you're on that item.

743
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,090
What?

744
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:12,170
Send us your resume by midnight.

745
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,530
Baek Ki.

746
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,840
Is the document I asked for ready?

747
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:25,830
I'll wrap it up so you 
can have it by tomorrow.

748
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,310
Baek Ki.

749
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:39,420
I won't stop you if you want to quit.

750
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,350
Steel is a conservative business.

751
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,970
A single item changes gradually, 
adjusting to the business market

752
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,190
over a long term.

753
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,130
So for our team members,

754
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,470
rather than someone who is eloquent 
and focused on instant results,

755
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,030
we need someone with basic skills

756
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,240
who can look far into the horizon.

757
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,610
So,

758
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:11,210
are you telling me you've 
taught me basic skills so far?

759
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,660
Then I've certainly been mistreated.

760
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:22,090
I've learned the basics in school, 
as an intern, and work training.

761
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,910
Teaching me the basics

762
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,910
is just an excuse.

763
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,590
I think you just don?t like me.

764
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,620
See you tomorrow.

765
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,830
I want to hear it this time.

766
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,310
How come you don't like me?

767
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,500
Baek Ki.

768
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,370
It's not a matter of 
liking someone or not.

769
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:12,630
I don't even know you that well.

770
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:16,150
Then what is it?

771
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,470
Don't you remember 
the first thing you did

772
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,790
after you were assigned to the team?

773
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,120
Sir.

774
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,490
I developed a profitable 
idea for the Steel team.

775
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,890
Are you talking about the 
business item report?

776
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:37,010
I think training includes the time 
to check what one has learned.

777
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,590
There's a big pile of files 
for a newbie to learn, but you

778
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,570
gave me a business report 
as soon as you came.

779
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,990
Before you even read 
the Steel item files.

780
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:54,870
If you try to stand out from the crowd,

781
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,170
you become hasty.

782
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,790
If the basic skills are so important,

783
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:08,000
why didn't you tell me from the start?

784
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,530
I gave you many chances
 to see your own

785
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,510
mistakes.
I don't know about others,

786
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,270
but that's my style.

787
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,730
Chances?

788
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,610
You call making graphs and

789
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:22,030
checking typos "chances?"

790
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:24,210
Can't I learn more by working

791
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,050
together with the team?

792
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,510
You have a long way to go.

793
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:11,890
[Send]

794
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,900
[Your email has been sent]

795
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,230
You're off for the day?

796
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,330
Yes.

797
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:32,510
Bye.

798
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:40,830
I decided to take your advice.

799
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:41,920
Huh?

800
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:46,110
I decided to give in as you said.

801
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:49,370
I realized what beats a strong spear

802
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:52,330
is not a stronger spear or a shield.

803
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:05,230
You found your solution

804
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:09,390
and I found mine.

805
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:34,210
Shouldn't you drink ginseng 
instead of onion juice?

806
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,010
She'll buy it for me next month
after kids.

807
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:41,980
Give it to me.

808
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,020
Why are you sweating so much?

809
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,290
It's weird.

810
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,430
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

811
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,910
I'm just hot.

812
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,390
I'll get some rest.

813
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:55,590
Sure.

814
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:10,210
This won't do.

815
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,950
I'll go get some air, Dong Sik.

816
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,090
-Yes.
-Answer any calls for me.

817
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:19,020
Yes, sir.

818
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,150
What's wrong with me?

819
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:04,050
Where on earth is Mr. Oh?

820
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:07,150
He went out for some air 
because he was dizzy.

821
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,410
He's not picking up his phone.

822
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,810
Dizzy?

823
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:13,830
He must've overworked himself.

824
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:21,070
Any other symptoms 
besides dizziness?

825
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,850
Other symptoms?

826
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,150
Like what?

827
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,550
Your forties are risky.

828
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:30,410
One of my friends worked like a dog

829
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:35,050
similar to him and had a stroke.

830
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:38,130
Come on, a stroke in your forties?

831
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,790
One actually collapsed due 
to high blood pressure.

832
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,130
And died.

833
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,970
Come on.

834
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,940
He fainted yesterday.
He had a nosebleed too.

835
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,670
What?

836
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,970
Why are you saying that now?

837
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,570
He still won't pick up?

838
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,050
No, although it's ringing.

839
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,110
I hope he didn't collapse somewhere.

840
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,530
I'm sorry.

841
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,290
Call him!

842
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,430
Keep calling him!

843
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,360
I'm ok, hurry up!

844
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,350
Please leave a message?

845
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:40,850
Where on earth are you, Mr. Oh?

846
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:50,510
Where is everyone?

847
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,160
Looking for Mr. Oh.

848
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,130
He went for a break 
and hasn?t returned.

849
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,650
He should've told us where he went.

850
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:03,450
He must be feeling under the 
weather and stressed out.

851
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:05,270
Under the weather?

852
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:07,570
Is it serious?

853
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:11,070
I heard he fainted and had 
a nosebleed yesterday.

854
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,770
I hope he didn't collapse somewhere.

855
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,960
Then why are you standing here?

856
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,420
-Get your team to look for him too!
-Yes.

857
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,290
Mr. Hwang, Mr. Jang?

858
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:09,290
What time is it?

859
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:17,910
Missed some calls?

860
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:22,630
Oh, Mr. Kim too.

861
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,610
Hi.

862
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,160
Mr. Oh!

863
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,090
Mr. Kim.

864
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,530
What's with you?

865
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:44,990
Why won't you get 
another health checkup?

866
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,810
Uh?

867
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,490
You know it's reflected 
in the performance.

868
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:52,810
Don't you know I have no choice 
if your form isn't filled in?

869
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:54,110
I'm sorry.

870
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:56,730
How old is your eldest?

871
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:00,110
He's in 6th grade now.

872
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:05,990
I've been to your kids' first birthdays.

873
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:10,010
With work here, I can't tell you 
to spend time with your family.

874
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:14,570
But a dad should 
take care of his health!

875
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,190
You need to include yourself 
in that, you know!

876
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:26,880
Get another checkup and find 
a big Middle East item next.

877
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,010
I'll support you this time.

878
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,870
Thank you, sir.

879
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:33,050
Wait.

880
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:35,990
Take this.

881
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:39,650
I bought dried eels for buyers.

882
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,890
Take it.

883
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,310
It's ok.

884
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,490
Come on.

885
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,100
Take it.

886
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,690
Take it!

887
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,550
It's heavy.

888
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:52,470
Thank you, sir.

889
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:56,210
Hello.

890
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,070
Yes.

891
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,670
Huh?

892
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:04,870
Mr. Oh!

893
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,190
It's ok, I'm sorry.

894
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:08,090
You were so dark.

895
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,170
Did Mr. Kim give you that?

896
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,060
It's dried eel.

897
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,270
You want some?

898
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:19,310
It?s ok, you have all of it.

899
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:20,790
Eat it for your health.

900
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:23,630
Don't let the stamina 
give you another kid.

901
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:26,570
Hey, Mr. Oh!

902
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,830
What on earth did you do?

903
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:43,970
Yes, Mr. Oh!

904
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:47,410
You said you didn't want to do it.

905
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,390
You sold your soul, didn't you?

906
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:52,870
How come he wants 
a double contract?

907
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:56,390
Card?

908
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,090
-Card?
-You haven't returned it, right?

909
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:00,770
Go treat yourselves with beef.

910
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:01,940
Ok?

911
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:06,410
Wow.

912
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:08,570
-Yes, Mr. Oh!
-What's going on?

913
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:12,610
So the wife entertainment worked?

914
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,290
Mr. Mun is that romantic?

915
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,790
I guess he is.

916
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:25,330
Let's call it a day.

917
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,330
What about beef?

918
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:29,330
No, I need to eat eel.

919
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,630
Geu Rae.

920
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:35,090
Clear the documents about 
Mr. Mun on my desk.

921
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:39,670
What about beef?

922
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,630
No.

923
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,380
Give us the card at least!

924
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:00,660
[Kang Mi Ra, Mun's Wife: 
Crucial person in charge!]

925
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,260
Come on.

926
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:11,910
[For the wife, wedding anniversary]

927
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:09,210
So Mun's wife is the person

928
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:12,510
in charge of the company.

929
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:17,180
So you chose your principle 
instead of the contract.

930
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,050
So you actually?

931
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:26,390
hit two birds with one stone.

932
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,810
It's a liberal foreign company.

933
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,870
There's not a lot of overtime work.

934
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:52,910
You can control the amount of your work.

935
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:56,550
They like your various experiences,

936
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:58,550
so just tell them.

937
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,750
Can I choose the dept. I want?

938
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,150
Probably.

939
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,450
Oh, he's too hasty.

940
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:19,670
When will we get more people?

941
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:23,130
I heard Mr. Kim would get 
us a pro on the Middle East.

942
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,410
He will, soon.

943
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:30,250
Who's coming?

944
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,530
I don't know.

945
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,010
Who's coming?

946
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,450
I don't know.

947
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:45,910
You need experience to be quick.

948
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,630
-Who do you wish would come?
-Young Yi.

949
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:51,430
She should've come to begin with.

950
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:52,800
-I'll?
-Go!

951
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:54,530
Go!

952
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:30,490
Mr. Oh.

953
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,040
Hello.

954
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,410
We're on the same team.

955
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,010
[Misaeng]

956
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:12,030
Target the crises in front of you.

957
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:13,280
Yes!

958
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,270
-What?
-Is the interview date set?

959
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,970
He's the legend of the 
Jordan export contract.

960
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,850
Shouldn't be so arrogant?

961
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:22,290
He's a part of Sales Team 3 now.

962
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:25,290
We didn't learn how to express 
our feelings in school.

963
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,150
They're not dating, are they?
What do you think?

964
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:29,860
-I don't know.
-Oh!

965
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,870
You're the pretty face of our place.

966
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:35,850
What did you do to spread 
those dirty rumors?

967
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:37,410
I'm going to quit.
