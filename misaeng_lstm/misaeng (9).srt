00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Not Yet Alive

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,490
Mr. Oh.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,730
Hello.

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,300
We're on the same team.

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,270
Mr. Kim.

6
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,280
You always seem like
 the perfect worker.

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,010
I'm Jang Geu Rae.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,320
Oh, the contract worker 
with connections?

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,890
I heard you only have a GED.

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,260
You're lucky.

11
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,130
How did he make it?

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,230
I heard he's not even competent.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,900
My seat?

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,500
Where is it?

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,980
It's here, right?

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,140
Whose is this?

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,150
Let's make a good team.

18
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,360
What are you saying?

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,530
Send another man, please.

20
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,670
If you can't, you don't 
need to send anyone over.

21
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,400
Hey.

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,770
Why are you acting like a kid?

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,410
I'm saying, I need someone 
to help the team.

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,810
That's Mr. Park.

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,950
You can't find anyone better nowadays.

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,950
Even when I was with Resource,

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,420
he brought in all the profits.

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,690
No one is a perfect fit.

29
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,460
You need to get used to each other.

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,590
Work is the priority.

31
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,970
Hey.

32
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,940
I heard you recommended Mr. Park.

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,280
Yes, isn't he talented?

34
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,910
What's with you?

35
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,180
You want me to clean up a mess?

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,450
-Mess?
-I have ears too.

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,520
I hear the rumors also.

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,590
Do you think I don't know you suffered 
when you worked with him?

39
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,760
I just thought he was good,

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,930
but he didn't suit our team.

41
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,900
I think he was like that due

42
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,500
to my lack of leadership.

43
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,270
Sounds like you would even sacrifice

44
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,740
yourself to send him away.

45
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,770
GED.

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,780
Yes.

47
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,910
Come here.

48
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,090
I heard you never went to college.

49
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,560
A rags-to-riches story, isn't it?

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,960
Interesting.

51
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,730
How did you pull off the 
entrance presentation?

52
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,930
Mr. Kim, did you give out

53
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,700
the tasks in advance?

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,140
You won't know how to do anything.

55
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,580
You're pretty, so you can 
be the face of our place.

56
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,020
Looks are key to sales positions.

57
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,120
So keep your chin up.

58
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,920
You have a girlfriend, don't you?
Show me her picture.

59
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,060
Come on.

60
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,730
You can get familiar later, 
get organized first.

61
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,160
Mr. Oh.

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,400
Pay me some respect in

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
front of the subordinates.

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,600
Save me some face here.

65
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,510
What did they call you before?

66
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,880
Of course?

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,910
How did you address Mr. Park 
when he was in your team?

68
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,680
Ok.

69
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,850
I don?t think I was out of line.

70
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,350
Sure, sure.

71
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,790
You didn't have to check that.

72
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,460
Why are you standing there?

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,390
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,540
Why were you just standing there?

75
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Huh?

76
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,580
Yeah, how could you 
possibly put up with him?

77
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,880
Why did they send Mr. 
Park of all people?

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,090
We're in big trouble.

79
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,030
[Misaeng]

80
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,530
Geu Rae.

81
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,270
[Episode 9]

82
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,370
Get the meeting files ready.

83
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,540
These are the meeting files.

84
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,610
Those are the Middle East items.

85
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,940
See if there's anything good.

86
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,080
What's the rush?

87
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,750
I've only been here for three days.

88
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,120
I haven't gotten myself oriented yet.

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,190
When will I read all these papers?

90
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,570
This will just be super tight.

91
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,110
This one won't be worth the effort.

92
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,710
GED.

93
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,380
You did this?

94
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,880
Mr. Oh.

95
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,490
This is no good.

96
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,960
You need more than ambition 
for the Middle East.

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,290
Then think of some plausible items.

98
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,930
You didn't hear me, did you?

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,700
I haven't gotten myself oriented yet.

100
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,540
Even with poker, when you join 
mid-game,

101
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,780
you take your time for that.

102
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,880
Gosh.

103
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,120
You're talented.

104
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,470
I'll come tomorrow.

105
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,470
Call me if anything comes up.

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,900
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,830
Hello, this is Jang Baek Ki.

108
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,430
Has the interview date been set?

109
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,300
Yes.

110
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,400
It's a weekday.

111
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,000
No.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,570
I can take a day off.

113
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,910
Bye.

114
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,350
Hey.

115
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,450
I never asked you for this.

116
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,860
Don't do what 
I didn't even ask you to.

117
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,430
Dang.

118
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,400
Here.

119
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,010
Dang.

120
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,620
Young Yi.

121
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,290
What are you doing?

122
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,220
Didn't you allow this?

123
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,060
As you said, I'll keep out of it.

124
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,500
I'll run your errands

125
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,170
while you're on that item.

126
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,100
Yeah?

127
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,240
Fine, go ahead.

128
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,380
Empty all the trash cans.

129
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Also, wash the bins.

130
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,620
What, you can't do it?

131
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,220
No, I'll do it.

132
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,020
Wash everyone else's 
too while you're at it.

133
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,230
Yes, sir.

134
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,140
Hey.

135
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,380
What's with her?

136
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,950
I gave her work since 
she was dying for some.

137
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,420
What's with you, man?

138
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,550
You shouldn't have made her do that.

139
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,920
I know.

140
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,860
Baek Ki.

141
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,030
Is this how you can be a team member?

142
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,980
Why throw that out there?

143
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,690
Baek Ki.

144
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,730
Dang.

145
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,830
I mean? dang!

146
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,530
Let's talk.

147
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,750
What's going on?

148
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,590
They? seem? weird.

149
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,620
They're not dating, are they?

150
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,490
Answer me, Geu Rae.

151
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,130
I don't know.

152
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,560
Ok.

153
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,810
You and I don't deserve 
this treatment here.

154
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,080
I don't think you need to stay

155
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,110
if the company doesn't want you.

156
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,580
-I think you should just leave too.
-Baek Ki.

157
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,790
Don?t ever butt in my 
business like this again.

158
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,890
I didn't mean "give in" like this.

159
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,160
Letting them have their 
way is your solution?

160
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,360
Yes.

161
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,530
I chose to do that.

162
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,760
That's not right.

163
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,660
Then what can I do?

164
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,600
What?

165
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Tell me if you know.

166
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,270
Working hard doesn't work,

167
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,370
and I can't just do nothing.

168
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,440
What else can I do?

169
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,480
We didn't learn in school 
how to approach to those

170
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,650
who shut you out.

171
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,480
Not in math or English class.

172
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
That's why.

173
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,180
That's why I'm just doing what I can.

174
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,290
I mean whatever I can.

175
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,590
This is my solution.

176
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,830
You said you found your solution.

177
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,830
So let's just

178
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,470
do our own thing on our own.

179
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,510
I'm going to quit.

180
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,930
Oh!

181
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,730
Suk Yool!

182
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,770
I sent the files to Tae Jin.

183
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,270
Good job.

184
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,610
I can trust you.

185
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,940
Good job.

186
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,010
-Shall we have some coffee?
-Yes.

187
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,850
Get the most expensive one.

188
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,650
-Two caramel macchiatos, please.
-Sure.

189
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,330
Sir, you've passed the limit.

190
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,630
Huh?

191
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,900
Try it one more time.

192
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,070
It doesn't work.

193
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,340
Here.

194
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,220
Here's the coffee.

195
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,950
Thank you.

196
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,850
Here's your card.

197
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,920
Thank you.

198
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,730
-You've passed the limit.
-Huh?

199
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,730
Oh, right.

200
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,760
How much was it?

201
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,130
Oh, $9.

202
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,500
I'm out of cash.

203
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,170
It's ok.

204
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,410
It's on me.

205
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,680
Yeah?

206
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,580
You're the man.

207
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,580
Thank you.

208
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,290
The Canadian buyer will call 
for the polyester item.

209
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,890
Get the list ready before then.

210
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,930
Canada?

211
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,300
He said he'd call at 11 AM their time.

212
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,570
That would be about midnight here.

213
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,800
Midnight?

214
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,830
Mm-hmm.

215
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,110
Also, get tomorrow's executives' 
breakfast meeting ready too.

216
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,270
Breakfast?

217
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,040
5:30 at Kings Hotel.

218
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,440
5:30?

219
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,480
In the morning?

220
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,580
Mm-hmm.

221
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,020
Oh.

222
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,920
Also, I can't go due to a business trip.

223
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,360
It's weird.

224
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,300
It's weird.

225
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,170
My boss just loves me.

226
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,340
Take care of that.

227
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,510
Yes.

228
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,240
It feels like

229
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,680
not receiving my pay 
after a part-time job.

230
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,750
Not a good feeling.

231
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,730
Hi, Suk Yool.

232
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,370
Geu Rae, can I see you 
in the lounge for a sec?

233
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,340
What?

234
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,680
What is it?

235
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,150
Here me out.

236
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,820
Tell me what you think.

237
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,820
As you know,

238
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,930
Mr. Sung 
has a great personality.

239
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,930
-I don't know.
-Huh?

240
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,030
Anyway?

241
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,160
It's weird.

242
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,770
-I think?
-Is he giving you his work?

243
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,070
Yeah.

244
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,270
You think so too?

245
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,010
It seems so to you too?

246
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,310
Hello?

247
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,210
-It's me.
-Who is this?

248
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,950
-Don't you know your boss's voice?
-Oh, Mr. Park.

249
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,180

Where's Geu Rae?

255
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,960
I don't know.
He was here a minute ago.

256
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,970
Use your power.

257
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,340
Power, power.

258
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,410
Ok.

259

It didn't work.

260
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,850
It didn't.

261
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,880
Your phone's been ringing.

262
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,380
Shouldn't you pick up?

263

It's ok, dude.

-Geez.
-$10 each.

269
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,670
That's absurd.
You hit it like that!

$10 each.

271
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,270

Thank you, Mr. Park.

Sure, make a lot of money.

277
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,380
Are you going to the sauna?

278
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,380
Yeah.

279

Hey, I'm a hotel VIP member.

281
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,260
I don't go to shabby bathhouses.

282
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,600
You're going to a hotel 
in those slippers?

283

Are you crazy?

Put them down.

287
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,990
You should have brought a shoe horn.

288
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,690
Get it together.

289
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,330
I'll go meet an old client.

290
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,130
Take these back.

291
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,690
What are those?

292
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,600
Nothing.

293

Where's Mr. Park?

294
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,170
He's meeting a client.

295
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,970
He just came to our team, which client?

296
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,610
He said it's a client from Resource.

297

What did they call you before?

300
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,200
How did you address Mr. Park 
when he was in your team?

301
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,930
I don?t think I was out of line.

302
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,610
Those are the Middle East items.

303
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,410
See if there's anything good.

304
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,420
We're all working for a salary.

305
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,520
Why act like a hot shot?

306
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,270
Where is he?
He's off for the day?

307
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,500
He went to Pohang for business.

313
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,160
Bye.

314
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,330

Mr. Kang's report has been reviewed,

317
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,740
so Steel can approve it first.

318
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,580

319
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,750
our approval too, so it's top priority.

I hope you don't have

326
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,970
your mind on other things.

327
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,500

328
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,970

Time to take off already.

332
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,800
Where were you, Mr. Park?

333

Geez, GED!

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,110
You didn?t tell him?

336
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,840
I told you I'd see a client.

337
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,250
-I?
-You meet clients at a sauna?

338
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,220
I can smell the mugwort.

What are you saying?

377
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,510
Who's higher here, 
Mr. Oh or Mr. Park?

378
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,240
Listen to yourself talking.

379
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,440
Dong Sik.

380
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,580
Come on, don't make 
this an issue, dude.

381
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,750
"Dude?"

382
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,280
Don't call me "dude," sir.

383
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,320
-What?
-Stop.

384
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,260

Hello, Mr. Kim.

390
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,340
Hi.
How do you like your team?

391
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,540
I look forward to fantastic teamwork.

392
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,350
This team is important.

393
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,810
Work hard.

394
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,880
I did my best to send you here.

395
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,220
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

396
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,790
-Ok.
-Sir.

397
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,520
Where do you go to 
shoot pool nowadays?

398
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,960
-I sprained my wrist last time.
-Oh.

399
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
So I'm taking a break now.

400
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,760
Are you ok?

401
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,160
I'm ok.

402
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,870
Anyway I have high hopes.

403
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,630
See you later.

404
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,610
See you, sir.

405
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,410
You shouldn't screw me over like this.

406
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,300
He used to be a good worker.

407
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,270
He'll help our team as 
a Middle Eastern expert.

408
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,800
I know.

409
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,810
He was the legend in the Steel team

410
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,710
with $120,000 Jordan export contract.

411
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,150
That was Steel's best achievement.

412
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,080
Mr. Park was amazing then.

413
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,420
Yeah?

414
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,890
He was an assistant manager

415
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,490
and in charge of communication 
with the site workers.

416
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,060
He was hands down the contract pro.

417
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,830
That's when things started to get risky.

418
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,870
Let's take him.

419
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,480
He's a part of Sales Team 3 now.

420
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,510
We should accept our 
members no matter what.

421
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,450
It's your frigging luck.

422
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,290

Halal item starting tomorrow.

Be patient.

425
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,360
You're good at that.

427
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,030

428
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,700
Mr. Oh, I don't like that either.

429
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,010
Geu Rae.
What's with you?

430
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,380
Of course you can be told off
for lacking skills at work,

431
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,710
but personal insults 
are a different issue.

432
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,280
You should say no if you don't like it.

433
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,580

[Inspiration of attacks]

445
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,090
Jumping down a bridge doesn't 
mean you're courageous.

446
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,490
I heard you only have a GED.

447
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,490
Ignoring a path which makes 
you want to jump down a bridge,

448
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,960
and going your own path 
requires courage too.

449
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,100
It's not smart to respond 
immediately when there's trouble.

450
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,970
When you keep your cool while 
your opponent doesn?t,

451
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,840
ultimately gives them trouble.

452
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,210
If you allow it, I'll support Mr. Park.

453
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,750
So keeping my cool is the best way

454
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,150

Uh?

464
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,410
You were an intern with Resource, right?

Yes.

466

What was Mr. Park like?

467
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,250
You must know since 
he was in Resource?

468
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,780
You want me to badmouth my boss?

469
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,380
No.

470
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,020
I'm sorry if that's how you took it.

471
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,870
He'll be a bit

hard for you to handle.

473
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,740
I can imagine how he treats you,

474
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,870

Wow.

You're really unqualified, 
but a competent newbie.

481
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,750
How did you find it?

482
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,490
I got the contacts from another 
team who did a Halal item.

483
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,820
I called the Arab-related companies 
and asked if they could do it.

A discount on large freight.

495
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,900
It's a cheap rate you apply 
on the transport charges

496

the parts and it's economical

so it's profitable for the importer.

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,860
Mr. Park.

557
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,760
I've completed the butchery 
and certification research

558
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,360
according to type and nation.

559
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,600
Leave it there.

560
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,870
Hey.

561
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,100
Could you massage my shoulders?

562
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,640
It hurts so much, so 
massage them, will you?

563
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,680
I wonder why they ache so much.

564
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,220
What?

565
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,250
You can't do it?

566
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,550
It's fine.

567
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,320
It's so soothing.

568
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,590
Hey.

569
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,760
Did you get professional training?

570
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,430
Why are you so good?

571
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,100
Wow, you can make 
a living after you quit.

572
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,510
Mr. Oh.

573
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,210
He's so good.

574
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,880
That's enough.

575
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,980
Geu Rae has a lot of work to do.

576
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,220
It won't take long.

577
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,750
That's enough.

578
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,190
That's enough.

579
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,690
I feel good now.

580
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,030
Geu Rae.

581
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,030
Did you learn how to 
massage feet too?

582
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,070
Massage them just a bit.

583
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,200
Geu Rae.

584
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,640
It hurts so much every 
time I go like this.

585
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,140
Come on.

586
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,280
It hurts.

587
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,280
Wait, stop.

588
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,220
Mr. Kim, yes.

589
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,560
I'm doing good.

590
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,930
Yes.
Things are going well, right?

591
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,230
Yes.

592
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,260
I changed my team.

593
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,700
Geu Rae.

594
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,410
Let's talk.

595
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,890
Is it because of your name?

596
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,860
Huh?

597
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,090
You just keep saying "yes" to

598
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,930
everything because that's 
what "Geu Rae" means?

599
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,670
If you can't do it, say 
"no" since it's ok.

600
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm not just talking about Mr. Park.

601
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,070
Once you start working, your 
true colors are bound to show

602
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,070
when you face frustrations.

603
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,380
But not in your case.

604
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,350
You always obey without 
a single complaint.

605
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:56,790
It seems like you're 
ready to accept anything.

606
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,990
Like a long-term prisoner 
who was released.

607
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,860
Like you're struggling 
to adjust to society?

608
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,630
That was too much.

609
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,930
I'm sorry,

610
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,730
but you're really like that.

611
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,940
I don't know your past.

612
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,040
I just know you have a GED and 
haven't done anything so far.

613
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,980
What kind of past can make you this

614
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,710
cooperative and self-sacrificing?

615
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,220
You know?

616
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,390
I want to get to know you

617
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,260
better in the near future.

618
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,730
See you soon.

619
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,050
Get some sleep.

620
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,960
You worked all night and 
coordinated the breakfast.

621
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,560
Did you get any sleep?

622
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,890
I'm ok, sir.

623
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,460
Assistant managers usually 
take care of the breakfast.

624
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,830
Good job.

625
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,200
Mr. Sung must have it hard too.

626
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,670
Working all night and 
the business trip too.

627
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,800
Working all night?

628
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,740
Why did he volunteer to go on 
the unnecessary business trip?

629
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,140
Unnecessary business trip?

630
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,450
I wonder how far the Canada 
polyester items are coming along.

631
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,650
You don't know about his item, right?

632
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,090
Oh, I know?

633
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,120
Hello, sir.

634
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,920
I'm back.

635
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,020
Are things ok, Suk Yool?

636
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,160
Good job.

637
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,960
Bring the Polyester item.

638
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,760
-I'll make a report now.
-Sure.

639
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,650
Suk Yool.

640
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,750
You haven't emailed the 
polyester items yet.

641
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,990
You should have CC'ed it 
to me if you're done.

642
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,190
You forgot?

643
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,790
You were doing fine.

644
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,700
Here you go.

645
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,300
I revised the whole list yesterday.

646
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,940
-Let's hurry with it.
-Yes, sir.

647
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,310
You heard him.
Let's hurry.

648
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,080
Mr. Sung.

649
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,280
Yeah.

650
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I'd like to talk with you.

651
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,420
I can't do it.

652
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,590
What?

653
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,960
You can't do it?

654
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,890
I'm too busy to do it.

655
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,990
Can you please do it?

656
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,430
-What?
-It's your job.

657
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,700
The polyester case and 
the breakfast too.

658
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,870
Suk Yool.

659
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm really busy with the 
next quarter's work.

660
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,740
I can't do your work on top of it.

661
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,940
What?

662
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,680
You can't do my work?

663
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,780
Listen to yourself talking.

664
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,250
You're saying I gave my work to you?

665
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,290
-In some ways?
-Hey!

666
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,630
New generation newbies are no good.

667
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,600
Can't you help your senior?

668
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,400
Also, I'm training you, 
I didn't give you my work.

669
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,140
Watch what you say!

670
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,240
Baek Ki.

671
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,010
We got a reply for the 
report to Finance.

672
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,440
Alright.

673
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,850
[Rejection: Kim Sun Joo]

674
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,850
What?

675
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,850
No reason for Finance to hold off on it?

676
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,420
Kim Sun Joo?

677
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,830
"No reason for Finance to hold off

678
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,600
on it" is the way she words it.

679
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,600
It means you should find 
the reason yourself.

680
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,330
It means the basics are 
missing or it's good,

681
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,440
but something key is missing.

682
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,600
That's the usual case.

683
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,900
I see.

684
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,570
I'm sure you have the basics.

685
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,140
Double-check what's missing.

686
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,450
Yes, sir.

687
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,980
Thank you.

688
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,790
It means the basics are 
missing or it's good,

689
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,960
but something key is missing.

690
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,460
Dang basics.

691
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,770
Here.

692
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,440
Young Yi.

693
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,640
Yes.

694
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,310
Wipe my desk too.

695
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,610
Yes, sir.

696
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,020
-Young Yi.
-Yes.

697
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,890
Wipe my desk too.

698
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,090
Yes.

699
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,460
-Mine too.
-Yes, sir.

700
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,230
You're still not ready?

701
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,260
Hurry, it's time for the meeting.

702
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,830
I'm ready.

703
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,940
Geez, clean that up.

704
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,040
Yes.

705
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,170
Hey.

706
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,610
Are the files ok?

707
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,140
Huh?
Yes.

708
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,950
I'm glad, be careful.

709
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,780
Young Yi, clean that up.

710
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,080
Yes.

711
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,160
Stay.

712
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,490
I'll bring it.

713
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,820
What's with us newbies?

714
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:22,060
A big pushover.

715
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,060
A tormented maid.

716
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,060
A stressed out guy.

717
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,160
As well as me.

718
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,970
Gosh.

719
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,240
Dang, Young Yi.

720
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,740
Attack them.

721
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,810
What did I say?

722
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,610
You have to be strong.

723
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,510
You know what they say?

724
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:48,680
It's not smart to respond 
immediately when there's trou?

725
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,890
When you keep your cool while 
your opponent doesn?t,

726
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,560
ultimately gives them trouble.

727
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,940
What's he saying?

728
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:15,810
Hello?

729
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,280
I'm Lee Ji Hyun at headhunting 
firm, Search & Brains.

730
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,250
I called to confirm your 
interview for tomorrow.

731
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,480
It was tomorrow, wasn't it?

732
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,490
I can make it.

733
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:28,260
No, I'll take a day off.

734
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:29,960
Bye.

735
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,800
Sit down.

736
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,210
I heard you got rejected by Finance.

737
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,680
Yes.

738
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,750
Also, you don't know why.

739
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,950
Right.

740
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,780
I just went there.

741
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,020
Is this it?

742
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,190
Yes.

743
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,330
You shouldn't write out 
the schedule like this.

744
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,760
Make a chart for the approval format.

745
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,670
You should have calculated 
the man month.

746
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,030
[Man month: Number of people needed 
for each month in a project]

747
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,000
You only have the cost, and you 
don't know how many people.

748
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,870
You need to calculate it.

749
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:26,440
This new format is mighty refreshing.

750
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,680
What's this new format?

751
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,650
Didn't you learn our 
format during training?

752
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,390
Submit a revised version.

753
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,820
Finance keeps mentioning it.

754
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,160
I guess the smiling masked 
witch is nagging them.

755
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,830
-Keep it up.
-Thank you.

756
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,830
-Refreshing.
-Thank you.

757
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,400
Even Geu Rae doesn't do that.

758
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,410
Mr. Oh.

759
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,380
I'll see you tomorrow.

760
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,110
-See you.
-Bye.

761
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,520
Geu Rae.

762
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,790
You should go home too.

763
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,820
Ok, Mr. Oh.

764
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:25,700
Geu Rae.

765
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,410
-Young Yi.
-Getting off work?

766
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,010
Yes.

767
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,550
What a long day.

768
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,650
Yes.

769
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,980
I'll see you tomorrow.

770
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,250
Sure.

771
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,320
GED!

772
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,390
Getting off work?

773
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,520
Yes.

774
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,030
Times have changed.

775
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,760
You're leaving at 6 sharp.

776
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,660
Mr. Park, see you tomorrow.

777
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,500
Look at you.

778
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:05,510
Hey.

779
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,540
If she gets married, 
she'll be like Ms. Sun.

780
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:14,020
If she doesn't, she'll be 
like Ms. Kim Sun Joo, right?

781
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,990
See you tomorrow.

782
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,720
I'll see you tomorrow.

783
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,730
It seems like you're

784
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,030
ready to accept anything.

785
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,200
Like a long-term prisoner 
who was released.

786
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,040
Like you're struggling 
to adjust to society?

787
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,840
A long-term prisoner 
who was released.

788
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,480
What's wrong with that?

789
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,220
I'm showing everything now.

790
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,590
Why is the past necessary?

791
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,600
What?

792
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,710
Where are you, Mr. Kim?

793
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,040
The subway station.

794
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,910
Could you wait for me?

795
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,740
Why?

796
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,650
I have something to show you.

797
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,350
Oh.

798
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,820
This way.

799
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,290
Great view.

800
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,330
Tiring, isn't it?

801
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,730
It's ok.

802
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,160
My house.

803
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,670
-Here?
-Yes

804
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,110
Hi, Mom.

805
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,880
You're early.

806
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,480
Have dinner.

807
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,180
I cooked mackerel.

808
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,350
I made a mistake and 
the tail smells fishy.

809
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,420
It's always smelly.

810
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,320
So let's decide who 
will eat the tail now.

811
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,430
Don't think the mom 
should always eat it.

812
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:20,860
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

813
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,200
This is my team's Mr. Kim.

814
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,530
Hello, ma'am.

815
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,730
Oh.

816
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,400
Your boss is here.

817
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:30,910
Did you have dinner?

818
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,610
I'm fine, I'll leave soon.

819
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,210
He wanted to show me something.

820
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,050
Show him what?

821
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,280
Maybe a hidden bride or something?

822
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:43,990
Maybe not.

823
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,160
Why, you!

824
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,390
What are you up to?

825
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,290
What are you up to to have

826
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,660
such dirty rumors spreading?

827
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,430
Ma'am!

828
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,400
That was a joke!

829
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,570
-Joke?
-Yes.

830
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,770
That was a joke.

831
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,840
-I know.
-Yes.

832
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,510
-Huh?
-I was joking too.

833
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,310
This is what I call a real joke.

834
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,050
You should work on your jokes.

835
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,820
It's neither funny or touching.

836
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,680
Let's go in, Mr. Kim.

837
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,790
Let's eat, Mom.

838
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,090
I'm sorry?

839
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,230
Excuse me.

840
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,030
I'm so full.

841
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,200
I hope you liked it.

842
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,600
Oh, it was so good!

843
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,200
I'm glad to hear that.

844
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,500
Yes.

845
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,710
Oh?

846
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:44,410
It smells too fishy.

847
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,280
Yeah?

848
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,150
Then I'll just eat it.

849
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,020
I'll?

850
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,160
I thought your taste 
could be different.

851
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,420
But why?

852
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,700
-Then enjoy your time.
-Bye.

853
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:21,380
The tail, I should've eaten that.

854
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,280
That's her type of joke.

855
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,450
She thinks it's funny, 
but it's not at all.

856
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,790
Joke?

857
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,390
Yes, don't worry about it.

858
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,190
Joke.

859
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,130
Right.

860
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,070
-I have a question.
-Yes.

861
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,700
Why is your place so vacant?

862
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,040
I threw everything out.

863
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,610
A released long-term prisoner 
doesn't need a lot.

864
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,450
I was out of line.

865
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,610
I'm sorry.

866
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,920
Remember I said sorry.

867
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,290
I threw out a lot, but 
there's still a lot left.

868
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,120
What's with this Go board?

869
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,060
I used to play Go.

870
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,390
Go?

871
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,730
Yes.

872
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,630
My uncle taught me as a kid for fun.

873
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,700
I must have seemed to have talent.

874
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,940
I entered the real world.

875
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:26,940
The real world means 
a world just for Go.

876
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:36,350
I only had friends in 
the Go contest world.

877
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,520
I played Go for over 10 hours a day.

878
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,190
That was my teenage life.

879
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,660
I wanted to be a professional player.

880
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,360
Of course, I failed and met you.

881
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,840
I threw out almost all

882
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,870
I had except one thing.

883
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:06,810
These are the basics of 
all the games I played.

884
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,250
Can I see?

885
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,490
Yes.

886
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,830
I wrote down reasons for 
each success or failure.

887
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:24,030
Then my master would write this.

888
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,940
I started this since I was 11.

889
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,840
It reminds me of 
everything at that time.

890
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,770
You're amazing.

891
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:35,510
Amazing.

892
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,550
What's this?

893
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,180
The circumstances of the company.

894
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,850
-Circumstances?
-Yes.

895
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,090
It's like a diary and

896
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:49,290
each day is a game of Go.

897
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,660
Why are there so many 
pages for this day?

898
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:56,030
It's like a one-to-multiple-players 
game.

899
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,670
Usually, you play against one player.

900
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:03,140
Sometimes a pro will play

901
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,540
against a bunch of amateurs.

902
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,350
The pro usually wins them all.

903
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,980
I learned one-to-multiple-player 
games exist in society.

904
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,550
The difference is,

905
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,250
the amateurs have to 
play against many too.

906
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,420
I play with you.

907
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,890
I play with Mr. Oh.

908
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,260
I play with other depts.

909
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,530
I also play with competitors.

910
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:34,970
One day,

911
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,870
I'll have to play against the company.

912
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,210
I'll show you a trick

913
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,410
when you play Go.

914
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:50,410
When amateurs play with pros,

915
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,550
they start off with 4 or 8 extra points.

916
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,660
In reality, the pros start off with

917
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,160
extra points instead of the amateurs.

918
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:05,530
The pros begin with 4, 8 or

919
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:09,430
a countless number of points.

920
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,140
What's scarier is that the

921
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,140
amateurs' rules don?t change.

922
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,140
Amateurs' rules?

923
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,010
You need to put in extra.

924
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,320
In my case especially, I can't beat?

925
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,150
make it maintaining the status quo.

926
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,650
New employees?

927
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,790
They have to create results although

928
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,130
they don't have experience.

929
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,640
How did you come to our company?

930
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,340
I have a sponsor.

931
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,180
It's a small firm called Seong Won.

932
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,610
He's the president there.

933
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:57,150
He's acquaintances with Mr. Choi.

934
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:00,250
So the executive director 
pulled some strings.

935
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,080
That's why Mr. Oh?

936
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,390
Get out.

937
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,020
Get out, man!

938
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,860
You have great connections.

939
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,660
He probably doesn't even remember.

940
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,060
I never saw him personally
 after I came.

941
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,470
Why couldn't that sponsor

942
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,470
help you earlier?

943
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,940
He did.

944
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:26,570
I worked for him right 
after I got my GED.

945
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,040
Why did you quit?

946
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,950
At that time?

947
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,250
At that time, I didn't hide 
my past as a Go player.

948
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:42,360
They were interested in it at first.

949
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,990
Then they became suspicious.

950
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:50,160
It led to uncomfortable conviction.

951
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,500
"He's inflexible because he played Go."

952
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,040
"That Go player always 
goes by the book."

953
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:58,940
I barely worked for a year 
and served in the army.

954
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,440
That's why you hid your past?

955
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,410
Because you might seem like a failure?

956
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,510
You're not a failure.

957
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:11,620
As a community college graduate, 
it was hard for me to get a job.

958
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,020
After I passed and came to work,

959
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:21,290
it felt like I had simply 
opened a door, not a success.

960
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:32,540
I think we keep opening doors our whole

961
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:37,040
lives instead of succeeding or failing.

962
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,580
Then what's success?

963
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,680
Wouldn't it depend on what

964
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,280
meaning you give to that moment?

965
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,850
Sometimes contracts you couldn't

966
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:52,520
seal make you feel fulfilled.

967
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,490
Would that mean a failure?

968
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:00,530
Sometimes you fail in Go 
matches, but you feel good.

969
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,630
Would it be something like that?

970
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,500
I'm not sure but

971
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,900
I guess so?

972
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,080
Let's start anew starting tomorrow.

973
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,650
Thank you.

974
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,850
I actually have a Twitter ID.

975
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:22,090
I was never really active.

976
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:23,850
You want to join too?

977
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,060
Follow me.

978
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:28,430
I read somewhere not 
to use SNS with bosses.

979
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,360
Bye.

980
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,830
Face?

981
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,070
Never mind.

982
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:36,500
Good night.

983
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,600
Just go back home, Geu Rae.

984
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,070
See you tomorrow.

985
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:22,180
Haven't you learned 
anything in our team?

986
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,880
I think it's time for me 
to apply what I've learned.

987
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,320
I've learned the basics in school,

988
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,920
as an intern, and work training.

989
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,620
If the basic skills are so important,

990
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:36,090
why didn't you tell me from the start?

991
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,030
I gave you many chances 
to see your own mistakes.

992
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:43,860
Teaching me the basics 
is just an excuse.

993
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,770
I think you just don?t like me.

994
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,640
Just attack them.

995
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,880
Regardless of hierarchy.

996
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:40,520
Hello?

997
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,060
Baek Ki.

998
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:54,200
Didn't you call regarding
 the budget plan?

999
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:58,500
Yes.

1000
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,470
Which part?

1001
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:04,540
It was rejected because 
I lacked the basics.

1002
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,440
You didn't add 
the man months, did you?

1003
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:09,510
Right.

1004
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,990
How do I add them?

1005
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,120
It's $8,000 for the 4-month project.

1006
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,330
Categorize it as four mid-level people.

1007
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,800
It's usually calculated 
as $4,500 per person.

1008
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,130
Calculate it as manpower.

1009
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:31,300
You forgot the piping map, 
didn't you?

1010
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,810
Piping map?

1011
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,440
We made one before, but the 
agency sent a revision.

1012
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,780
We need to reflect that.

1013
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:45,720
There's an attachment 
which you can ask Ms. Shin about.

1014
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,990
Yes, so that needs to be reflected 
in the timetable and budget too?

1015
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:52,160
Right.

1016
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,720
Use the company's format including

1017
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,230
margins like I told you before.

1018
01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:00,300
Let them know the percentage 
difference from last time.

1019
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,170
Baek Ki.

1020
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,240
Yes.

1021
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,310
See you tomorrow.

1022
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:24,990
Yes.

1026
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,560
I don't know what is shown,

1027
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,430
but the world is full of 
those who want to be seen.

1028
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:44,700
I wonder why people 
confess about themselves.

1029
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:51,270
In the game of Go, the parts
are determined by the whole.

1030
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:54,810
The rules in the world 
of Go are already set.

1031
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,220
If the Go board's 
possibilities are infinite,

1032
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,930
if the world's possibilities 
are infinite,

1033
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,660
is it possible to win or lose?

1034
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,430
Really?

1035
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,670
I'm determined by this whole land.

1036
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,800

1037
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,210

1038
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:52,800

01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,470
