188
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,740
I don't want to announce 
 I wanted out.

189
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,220
I'm regretting telling you big time.

190
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,530
Come here, Suk Yool.

191
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,400

192
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,300
I can put up with incompetence,

193
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,080
but I can't put up with 
rude subordinates.

194
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,050
You didn't greet me once today.

195

196
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,390

You really don't know 
why I'm like this?

200
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,500
How should I know your 
personal affairs?

201
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,960
This isn't right.
You're at work now.

202

You don't take work back home.

203
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,420
You shouldn't bring personal 
stuff to work either!

I'll take a half-day off today.

I can't sit down because 
of my headache.

211

Hey, did you have a meeting?

212
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,520
You should clean up if you're done.

213
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,920
Where's Young Yi?

214
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,490
Young Yi, clean this.

215
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,560
Yes.

216

Young Yi.

218
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,960
Go get my shoes from 
the repair center.

219
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,410
Also, get me liquid digestive 
medication on the way back.

Yes.

224
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,830
-I'll be right back.
-Ok.

225
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,800
Mr. Yoo, what are you doing?

226
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,320
She said she'd run my errands, 
not clean up after you.

227
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,270
I just?

228
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,980
Don't you think it was too much?

Hey.

232
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,020
I'm suspicious of his intentions 
regarding Young Yi.

233
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,320
What?

234
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,020
Intentions?

235
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,600
He really?

236
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,070
I think he thinks of 
her as a personal maid.

237

We're trying to train her officially.

238
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,700
He just slaves her 
around personally.

239
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,710
That's not right.

240
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,840
He shouldn?t do that.

241
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,850
Sir.

242
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,190

Make sure the fertilizer in the 
Seobu Chemicals storage room is sent

247
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
to the container yard in Incheon 
Port by tomorrow morning.

248

That is set to take off in five days.

249
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,070
Just do what I say.

250
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,270
We should move them when there's time.

251
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,460

period, so take care of it.

How big should I expand it?

381
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,720

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,060
The subcontractor seems

00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,960
It's all because I'm lacking!
Ok?

733
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,250
In order to understand 
why this move was made,

734
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,400
you must look at the previous move.

735
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,150
This could happen 
during business?

736
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,670
In order to understand why 
the opponent is resisting,

737
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,970
you must review the previous moves.

738
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,030
We always do business?

739
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:43,710
What might have looked like a small

740
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,110
problem, might not be at all.

741
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,530
Give-and-take, we need to give first?

742
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,080
That's what was going on.

743
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,270
Then they'll give to us too.

744
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,670
I'll write a statement to explain this.

745
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,470
Then that will solve the problem.

746
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,950
Mr. Park was revealing it all.

747
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,430
Let's go to the company.

748
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,930
James.

749
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,950
The man named James
 at ICV company?

750
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,930
?is Mr. Park.

751
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,210
James Park.

752
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:22,580
Mr. Park Sang Joon in 
Jordan is your cousin?

753
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,850
What's going on?

754
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,350
What happened?

755
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,410
It's his son.

756
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,570
Every crack is completed 
by the internal conditions.

757
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,970
Right?

758
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,970
Mr. Park.

759
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,310
Geu Rae.

760
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,230
You jerk...

761
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,140
He would've thought 
of it as compensation.

762
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,500
Park Jong Sik!

763
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:46,160
In 2008, a $0.12 mil. export 
contract was sealed.

764
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,680
Steel accomplished the 
biggest deal by itself.

765
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,440
Mr. Park was in charge of 
communication with the locals.

766
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,720
He solved every single problem and

767
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,460
helped the contract to be signed.

768
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,300
Ok, ok, what is this?

769
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,240
It's the general manager's 
company card!

770
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,240
Let's party tonight!

771
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,600
Oh, thank you.

772
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,420
Come on.

773
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,320
You should be enjoying the night.

774
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,320
What's with you?

775
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,840
You should go to the end.

776
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,300
Right.

777
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,520
Go until I die.

778
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,180
Please sir.

779
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,750
I'll treat you to a drink.

780
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,480
This is no fun.

781
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,690
They get all the money.

782
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,460
I just get a salary?

783
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:53,040
This won't work, sir.

784
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,680
Excuse me?

785
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,200
Mr. Park.

786
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,640
What are you doing?

787
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,120
You can't do this.

788
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,300
It must have started like that.

789
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:20,860
He must have thought, "This 
is how you get compensated".

790
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,350
You can send 20% here.

791
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,350
[Dongyang Bank]

792
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,220
He would come to ask for returns.

793
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,220
You should work on a big scale.

794
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,940
Just take over an old local company.

795
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,040
Get some reliable men in there

796
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,160
and you'll rake in money regularly.

797
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,080
Whatever sales profits 
come in are yours.

798
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,320
You should get paid for your sweat.

799
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,800
Don't you think?

800
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,760
He must have opened his eyes

801
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,940
and started to see the world.

802
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,040
Mr. Park.

803
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,440
Where's the boss?

804
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,800
I don't know.

805
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,800
Why act busy like that?

806
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,660
Right?

807
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,820
Everything must have 
seemed silly to him.

808
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,820
This apartment is much cheaper 
than the market price.

809
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,600
Nice location.

810
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,960
He must have started to think

811
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,430
life was easy and natural.

812
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,140
Then everything became nothing.

813
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,270
How will it turn out?

814
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,680
I don't know.

815
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:29,360
From an outsider's point of view, 
the good triumphed over the evil.

816
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,720
Company rules work differently though.

817
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,020
Company rules?

818
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,860
Let's just be satisfied 
that we did what we could.

819
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,980
How did you think of finding 
out Mr. Park's English name?

820
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,200
Yeah.

821
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,280
When I checked the fax, there were

822
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,940
many Parks among the executives' list.

823
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:50,400
When I asked what his business 
card said, it was James Park.

824
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,880
Auditing team?

825
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,810
When Baek Ki asked the 
Audit team about Mr. Park,

826
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:02,000
the names of Mr. Park's father and 
this company's CEO were similar.

827
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,200
How did you know he was 
Park Sang Joon's cousin?

828
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,720
Mr. Park only has one older sister.

829
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,220
His father has only one brother.

830
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,280
So I assumed it must be his cousin.

831
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,660
Gosh, I can't believe it.

832
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,100
I think it's his cousin.

833
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,330
Wow.

834
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,380
Make sure no other 
companies suffer damages.

835
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,900
Yes, sir.

836
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,440
[12:22AM]

837
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,100
I'm tired.

838
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,760
You clearly told her to come back?

839
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,500
Yes.

840
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,760
I made it clear a female

841
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,080
can't do anything there.

842
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,680
Yes.

843
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,900
Where are you?

844
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,870
[Ha Sung Joon]

845
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,980
Mr. Ha.

846
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,120
Are you home?

847
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,940
No, I'm driving now.

848
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,660
I heard it didn't work out.

849
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,000
How could you just go 
home when things changed?

850
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,880
I told you to go straight home as?

851
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,550
What?

852
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,480
What?

853
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,500
What are you talking about?

854
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,460
So don't worry.

855
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:36,100
After I go to Incheon Port, 
I just need to make two more trips.

856
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,580
Everything can be 
completed by tomorrow.

857
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,000
You fool!

858
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,570
You idiot!

859
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:44,180
Are you trying to screw me over?

860
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:47,180
You crazy witch!

861
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,150
How could you do this to me?

862
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,780
You moron.

863
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,140
You don't have to do it by 
tomorrow, so come back now.

864
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,850
I'll get someone tomorrow, 
so come back now!

865
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,620
Mr. Ha is so mean?

866
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,830
How could he curse at you like that?

867
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,220
Young Yi.

868
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,000
You still want to work here?

869
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,300
Why must we get treated like 
this after working so hard?

870
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,300
Where is the justice?

871
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,980
We really worked hard.

872
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,070
Are you ok?

873
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:15,260
You frigging witch, do you want to die?

874
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,940
What would you have done if 
you got into an accident?

875
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,980
You know how bad an industrial 
accident is to the company's image?

876
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,400
I'm sorry.

877
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,400
Get out of my face!

878
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,440
I'll just park?

879
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,440
Beat it!

880
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,820
-Hello.
-What's this?

881
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,680
Sorry.

882
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:55,780
Bye.

883
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,320
The level of responsibility 
differs upon position.

884
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,540
The head of the dept. and general 
manager will have it tough.

885
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,010
Especially tougher if you're higher up.

886
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,910
Especially tougher?

887
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:43,160
You'll be relegated to a petty position.

888
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,420
If the police investigations prove 
the case to be bigger,

889
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,560
you'll have to leave.

890
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:58,880
People think we just wear neckties 
and work like a block in the wall.

891
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:04,370
We think our actions won't 
affect society or the company,

892
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,000
but work is our life.

893
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,140
It's still a game of Go.

894
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,180
Eventually.

895
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,400
That's what Cho Chi Kun said.

896
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,440
Succeeding at a game of Go

897
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,760
doesn't affect the world.

898
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,160
You're right.

899
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:42,240
It's still a game of Go.

900
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,940
Regardless of the world,

901
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,760
it's still my whole life.

902
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,600
What's wrong with you?

903
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,600
So pathetic.

904
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,420
Why is Sales Team 3 involved 
with Resource team's business?

905
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:59,360
It's such a pathetic game of Go.

906
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,620
I found out the reason today.

907
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,290
It's just a game of Go after all.

908
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,500
Because it's still Go.

909
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,060
My game of Go.

910
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,480
Because it's my work.

911
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:12,300
Because it's 
the world given to me.

912
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,080
[Misaeng]

913
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,110
Don't be suspicious.
Just focus.

914
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:39,160
You didn't come to our team 
for a different reason, right?

915
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,320
Giving rewards and 
punishments is my job.

916
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,020
Mr. Choi will be in trouble.

917
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,390
It will get uncomfortable.

918
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:50,860
You could become a conman 
underneath the boss.

919
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,130
If you play games at work,

920
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,200
it won't be good.
