There's a good market with potential.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,890
Few people will be convinced.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,970
To be honest, they'll think we're just

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,270
being greedy for
 performance results.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,770

Just focus on the work.

Mr. Ma is on a business trip,

00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,030

will think it's bad.

Honestly, half of the men 
under Mr. Choi are gone.

If you do this, they'll think 
you're screwing him over.

Aside from the politics, 
just look at the work.

Is it a reasonable business or not?

It's reasonable.

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,250
So Sales Team 3 is redoing it?

187
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,430
We'll try it.

188
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,160
What?

189
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,290
"We'll try it"?

190
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,580
How could you do it like thieves 
when even we're leaving it alone?

192
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,810
Thieves?

193
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,050
Then your team can go ahead and do it.

194
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,390
Hey!

195
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,470
I'm not saying we want to do it!
We know it's a good business.

196
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,410
Who doesn't know that here?

197
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,680
That's not why we're not doing it!

198
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,410
We set it up and we're not doing it.

199
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,830
Don't you know ethics 
or have a conscience?

200
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,230
What does ethics or a conscience 
have to do with work?

201
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,290
Mr. Kim, you shouldn't
 be like this too!

202
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,990
What can you expect?

203
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,300
He was trained under a guy 
without business ethics.

204
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,710
Who's the one without 
business ethics here?

205
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,870
Tell me.

206
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,710
You hid the B/L and 
blamed it on our team.

207
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,870
You're mentioning business ethics?

208
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,950
Are you crazy, you jerk?

209
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,650
Dong Sik.

210
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,520
You think this is right?

211
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,290
Mr. Oh will judge that.

212
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,450
Just ask yourselves if you can say 
that when you set aside corruption.

213
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,630
What, you jerk?

214
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,330
I can't believe this jerk!

215
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,300
Let go.

216
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Let go, man!

217
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,430
Hey!

218
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,930
You think Mr. Ma will give permission?

219
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,170
You really think so?

220
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,730
What will you do if he does?

221
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,930
You jerk?

222
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,170
What are you doing?

223
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,310
Geu Rae.

224
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,530
Lift your head up.

225
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,070
You didn't do anything wrong.

226
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,190
We're trying to work here.

227
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,020
There are no companies to work with

228
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,310
among the ones that failed before.

229
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,050
They all lack in size 
and other aspects.

230
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,930
Ok.

231
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,030
What are your thoughts, Mr. Chun?

232
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,410
I can't tell just by the files.

233
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,040
I'll have to visit them.

234
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,040
Ok.

235
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,510
How long will it take?

236
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,230
Five days.

237
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,080
Finish it within three days.

238
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,240
You go with him, Dong Sik.

239
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,770
Get rough drafts ready ASAP.

240
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,910
Yes.

241
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,650
Will it be better to divide

242
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,110
the districts with Mr. Chun?

243
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,310
One person has to drive 
to work on the road.

244
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,130
Yes, you should work together.

245
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,330
-Geu Rae.
-Yes.

246
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,990
Apply for a vehicle.

247
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,270
Yes.

248
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,190
Make suggestions that you can take on.

249
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,820
Are you capable of 
supporting this project?

250
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,050
Is Mr. Choi in?

251
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,160
Yes, please wait a minute.

252
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,820
Welcome.

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,320
You're looking good.

254
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,750
So, it's nice working with

255
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,490
Sales Team 3 again, right?

256
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,070
The team is redoing

257
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,690
Mr. Park's Jordan business.

258
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,600
So?

259
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,040
I don't know what to do.

260
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,850
What are you saying?

261
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,750
How can you say that 
when the team

262
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,690
has decided on a good business?

263
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,750
Why are you asking me, buddy?

264
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,850
You should work as a team member.

265
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,850
I remember that's why I sent you.

266
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,010
Gosh.

267
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,470
Life is tough.

268
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,390
So tough.

269
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,610
Mr. Chun, I'm heading off.

270
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,310
I'll pick you up at your 
place by 7AM tomorrow.

271
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,000
What are you doing?

272
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,970
You'll hurt your neck.

273
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,680
Uh,

274
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,930
I think I made a mistake.

275
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,790
I'm so embarrassed for 
making such a suggestion

276
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,650
without being able to 
take responsibility.

277
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,100
You're ridiculous.

278
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,590
You want to know what's 
really embarrassing?

279
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,300
Suggestion?

280
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,140
Responsibility?

281
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,670
Hey!

282
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,750
You said, let's do this!

283
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,550
Did I say, let's do it?

284
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,950
I think I was too easy on you.

285
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,770
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,830
Geu Rae!

287
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,990
You different-quantity-and
-quality-effort guy.

288
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,170
From now on, you'll read this

289
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,030
until you know it inside and out.

290
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,830
Just do whatever I ask of you.

291
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,790
That's what a newbie should do.

292
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,350
You don't think you could do 100%?

293
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,970
Then just do 80%.

294
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,820
A newbie trying to do 120% 
is the worst for the team.

295
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,720
Geez.

296
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,630
Where are you going?

297
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,770
To... get water.

298
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,090
Oh, Captain Jang, to get water?

299
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,670
Please give me 
a cup too, Captain Jang.

300
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,210
Run, man!

301
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,910
What?

302
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,870
Why make me repeat myself?

303
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,410
Our team will be involved in

304
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,490
the Mexico coal consortium

305
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,530
between Samjung and 
the Steel Team.

306
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,890
Your team, Steel and we 
will have a meeting soon.

307
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,270
Oh, there will be competition

308
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,210
with Samjung for export rights.

309
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,390
So be ready.

310
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,560
Mr. Shin is in charge there, right?

311
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,160
I heard he's meticulous.

312
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,510
Yes, he's excellent.

313
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,070
He was chosen as the Trading Man 
of the Year twice at that age.

314
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,070
Yes, he's amazing.

315
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,650
He joined Samjung as 
the youngest employee.

316
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,830
It was shocking when he was promoted 
as the youngest team leader.

317
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,490
He has won contracts over $0.15 
bil. for 5 consecutive years.

318
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,580
He's the youngest head of an overseas 
corporate, the best in the industry.

319
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,750
I heard he has a fan club.

320
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,490
I'm a member too.

321
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,130
You?

322
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,830
Aren't I better-looking?

323
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,970
She's speechless.

324
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,140
A consortium with the competing team

325
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,550
must be stressful for a newbie.

326
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,910
Yes, sir.

327
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,170
Hello.
I'm here for the upcoming case.

328
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,750
Long time no see, Baek Ki.

329
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,680
Hi.

330
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,230
Young Yi.

331
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,950
You shouldn't leave like this.

332
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,630
Bye.

333
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,830
Captain Jang.

334
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,610
What time is it in Jordan now?

335
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,830
Call Mr. Cho.

336
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,150
Mr. Oh.

337
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,370
Call him.

338
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,110
[Amman, Jordan]

339
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,210
Hello, Mr. Oh.

340
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,440
I heard you got promoted.
Congratulations.

341
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,530
Yes.

342
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,530
The rumors have spread here.

343
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,410
Just hanging in there now?

344
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,510
I need to find out the current status.

345
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,070
Can you send some data 
on related companies?

346
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,270
Yes, sir.

347
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,590
But Mr. Oh?

348
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,910
This is surely a good business

349
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,510
you don't want to waste.

350
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,930
I'm glad you thought of doing it again.

351
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,630
But the issue is that rumors of

352
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,490
the scandal can spread widely.

353
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,940
I know.

354
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,240
I'll have headquarters work 
on the Jordan government.

355
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,550
I appreciate it.

356
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,410
Thanks.

357
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,950
Did Mr. Kim's files come?

358
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,790
Yes, they'll come right 
after the company visit.

359
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,650
Get it updated right away so we 
can have a meeting when they come.

360
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,920
Yes.

361
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,630
Where did they go today?

362
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,430
They'll be in Gunsan.

363
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,410
Good-bye.

364
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,350
Bye.

365
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,630
Thank you.

366
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,650
It's not easy.

367
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,310
There's no supply complex, so 
there are many small companies.

368
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,350
When we need a bigger size.

369
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,840
A big company won't want to 
work with a conglomerate.

370
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,630
Not necessarily.

371
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,110
It's actually easier to procure parts,

372
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,830
so it's easier to package.

373
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,250
Let's go categorize companies 
with smuggling violations.

374
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,710
Yeah.

375
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,730
There were many.

376
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,250
Let's do that.

377
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,010
Where are we going next?

378
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,950
-It's ok.
-I'll drive.

379
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,640
Just do a rough draft 
and hand it over.

380
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,370
Geu Rae will finish it.

381
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,680
You think he'll do it properly?

382
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,350
We have to trust him.

383
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,780
Aren't you tired?

384
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,810
Shall I drive?

385
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,130
No, I'm ok for now.

386
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,650
We have enough companies now, sir.

387
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,650
-Yes.
-How's Jordan?

388
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,250
Yes, send it to my email.

389
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,650
You have my card?

390
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,770
That's great.

391
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,830
The costs and companies 
are accurate, right?

392
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,890
It will be a lot of work.

393
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,190
Yes.

394
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,710
Please send the files within this week,

395
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,270
We need to decide within a few days.

396
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,230
- No time really?
- I'll call you in Seoul.

397
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,370
Bye.

398
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,310
I'll have to do it as soon as I return.

399
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,470
Yes.

400
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,710
Bye.

401
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,750
We have two hours before checkout.

402
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,090
Shall we get some sleep?

403
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,250
Let's do that.

404
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,940
Mr. Chun.

405
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,210
Yeah?

406
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,220
You don?t like this business, do you?

407
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,450
You don't either.

408
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,610
But I don't think it will fail.

409
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,610
I know how you feel.

410
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,030
You want to support Mr. Oh

411
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,350
so he can do what he wants.

412
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,870
This company is the best in Jordan.

413
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,530
The financial statements look good.

414
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,220
Good performance.

415
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,090
Their resale performance is good too.

416
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,130
Solid market too.

417
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,830
- You know what it means?
- I can get a rough idea.

418
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,750
Except for the financial statements.

419
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,310
How can you exclude that when 
it's everything, Captain Jang?

420
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,830
Scan it for now.

421
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,890
Also, review it again from the start.

422
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,120
If the numbers pop,

423
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,550
check by category.

424
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,030
Yes.

425
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,430
The numbers have to pop.

426
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,490
The amount, unit, dollar 
conversion have to be quick.

427
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,370
Geez.

428
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,610
You can use all the help you can get.

429
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,130
How can you be teaching 
him like that now?

430
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,130
I know.

431
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,210
Young Yi should've come.

432
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,950
Geez, I wonder if Seok Ho is doing well.

433
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,530
Mr. Ma is coming the day 
after tomorrow, right?

434
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,310
Yeah.

435
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,720
Will it work?

436
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,190
We'll just do our best.

437
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,390
Ha!

438
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,750
You're an ambitious boss.

439
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,010
Yeah, you won't die for not

440
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,870
passing a business item.

441
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,210
The problem is something else.

442
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,110
With the concrete-like 
teamwork of your team,

443
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,490
you could get cracks.

444
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,820
Why aren't you saying anything?

445
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,450
I'm a daredevil who only 
looks for risky business.

446
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,310
Come like the wind?

447
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,200
What's with that bark?

448
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,010
Time for my medication.

449
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,190
See you.

450
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,870
[Audit report]

451
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,710
[Financial statement]

452
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,290
The numbers have to pop.

453
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,010
The amount, unit,

454
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,680
dollar conversion have to be quick.

455
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,950
It should visually pop first.

456
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,750
Next are the numbers.

457
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,590
Get yourself familiar with the form.

458
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,130
And continue researching the 
faults and flaws of that form.

459
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,100
Just like the game of Go,

460
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,870
I'll build a structure that
is easy to read visually.

461
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,570
But?

462
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,690
did I succeed in Go?

463
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,350
I don't know if I can bring the rules

464
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,030
of a failed game to 
succeed in this game.

465
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,630
Can I do that?

466
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,190
- Hello.
- Hi

467
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,250
Where's Mr. Oh?

468
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,870
He'll come back soon.

469
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,390
Oh, how was it?

470
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,590
Good.

471
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,630
Good job.

472
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,550
I'm sure you want to go home,

473
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,010
but I'll need a report first.

474
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,910
Sure.

475
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,770
There are many companies 
that are ambitious.

476
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,770
Let's go.

477
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,870
Bring it.

478
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,730
Took your medication?

479
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,190
Yeah, hi.

480
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:20,510
Geez, they'll stay up for three nights.

481
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,910
Gosh, I hope they're 
not wasting their time.

482
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,470
Geez.

483
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,790
Another meeting.

484
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,130
We're reviewing

485
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,230
Mr. Chun and Mr. Kim's list first.

486
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,800
Whether the companies are 
capable of provision,

487
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,810
whether they have a 
good financial status.

488
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,830
Coffee's here.

489
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,820
Mr. Chun.

490
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,020
Whether their vision matches 
ours and if it's realistic.

491
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,050
We're reviewing it thoroughly.

492
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,870
I'll go ahead with it.

493
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,310
Captain Jang.

494
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,330
Is there anything else besides coffee?

495
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,910
Mr. Jang.

496
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,810
So I didn't introduce him.

497
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,810
He's the team leader, Captain Jang.

498
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,350
A short break.

499
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,510
Everyone's laughing, but they 
have different thoughts.

500
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,690
The uncomfortable truth in the

501
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,210
uncomfortable atmosphere 
is being revealed

502
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,330
in the awkward laughter.

503
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,410
Hey, Sang Sik.

504
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,910
Are you crazy?

505
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,530
Are you insane?

506
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,690
This?

507
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,690
Yeah, about that?

508
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,730
It's like someone choked on 
a piece of steak and died,

509
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,010
and you were standing right 
there and you gobble it up.

510
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,970
Must you gobble it up?

511
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,910
It has to be revived 
even if it's not us.

512
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,930
Who are you to judge that?

513
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,710
You ruined others by digging 
into internal corruption

514
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,390
and made teams suspect each other.

515
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,850
Now you want to 
gobble up this business?

516
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,950
That?s why I hate 
you, you selfish jerk.

517
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,950
Forget it!

518
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,230
Please go through our files first.

519
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,590
Hey.

520
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,190
Do you think Mr. Choi will allow this?

521
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,290
Why stop him?

522
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,630
Excuse me?

523
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,460
It's a good profitable 
business, so why stop him?

524
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,630
You?re the head of a leading team,

525
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,850
you should have better judgment.

526
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,890
Mr. Choi.

527
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,540
Let's do it well.

528
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,810
You're lucky, Sang Sik.

529
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,030
You're under the company's 
spotlight as you wished.

530
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,320
What?

531
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,350
The company will be

532
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,090
briefing for your proposal.

533
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,470
Sir?

534
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,770
Mr. Choi and all the executives

535
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,130
will be at the presentation.

536
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,530
It's a good chance to 
be evaluated fairly.

537
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,770
It's not a presentation, but 
simply a business item?

538
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,970
Simply a business item?

539
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,970
You really think this is simple?

540
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,270
What?

541
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,990
Now that you started it and 
things are set, you're scared?

542
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,250
No way.

543
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,890
That's not you.

544
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,890
What?

545
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,350
You said you were so confident.

546
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,430
Get a detailed presentation 
ready by this week.

547
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,230
This is stressful for Mr. Choi too.

548
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,290
If he says no, you'll 
say he's being personal.

549
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,770
But he can't say yes 
when it's not possible.

550
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,930
So it should be a fair evaluation.

551
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,950
Mr. Oh.

552
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:19,290
It's on a bigger scale, so we 
should expand our size too.

553
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,370
Let's get our presentation 
Powerpoint files ready.

554
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,430
- Mr. Oh?
-Mr. Oh...

555
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,130
I know what you want to say.
There's no time, it's too much.

556
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,980
Above all? I know what 
Mr. Choi is thinking.

557
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,280
But?

558
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,190
So what?

559
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,190
You want to quit now?

560
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,130
No.

561
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,290
We can't do that.

562
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,650
We've come so far.

563
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,050
We should try at least.

564
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,530
Mr. Chun.

565
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,890
Let's do it.

566
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,900
Captain Jang.

567
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,730
We don?t need your opinion.

568
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,390
You need to summarize 
everything we've reviewed.

569
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,190
The info source should be accurate.

570
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,780
You need to estimate the rough 
prices from the companies.

571
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,850
Most importantly,

572
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,650
we need a strategy 
to persuade all those people.

573
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,710
It'll take a month.

574
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,690
- You take care of the Powerpoint.
- Sure

575
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,870
You'll do the first draft 
and presentation, right?

576
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,790
Right.

577
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,990
Mr. Chun.

578
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,930
Get ready and call Jordan.

579
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,010
Mr. Kim in charge of the Middle East

580
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,510
will be in a video meeting
 from Jordan.

581
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,170
Let's start.

582
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,610
Our team was experiencing 
a new sense of tension.

583
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,850
A new set-up, work has begun.

584
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,850
What?

585
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,850
The flight was delayed?

586
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,310
Geez, how much longer will it take?

587
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,830
Isn't the Samjung consortium 
meeting at 5:00?

588
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,520
Yes.
This is just crazy.

589
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,810
Ok, we'll take care of the meeting,

590
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,830
so come straight over after work.

591
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,830
Bye.

592
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,230
- Young Yi.
- Yes.

593
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,410
Mr. Ha can't make it to the meeting.

594
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,250
He already prepared files on Samjung

595
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,830
export rights, so you can go in, right?

596
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,390
I'm not?

597
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,610
We have no choice.

598
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,170
Think of this as a tee shot

599
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,390
and relax, just do your best.

600
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,990
-I'm Shin Woo Hyun.
- Nice to meet you.

601
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,420
I'm Jung Hee Suk of Resource Team 2.

602
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,010
You know Kang Hae Joon 
and Jang Baek Ki, right?

603
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,130
Hello.

604
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,310
Hello.

605
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,670
Please sit down.

606
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,720
This is our new employee, Ahn Young Yi.

607
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,710
Mr. Ha couldn?t make 
it due to circumstances.

608
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,210
Hello.

609
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,860
Oh, hi.

610
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,140
Ok, let's start the meeting.

611
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,570
This consortium is key in expanding

612
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,040
the business to resources.

613
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,110
Support will be given in various ways.

614
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,820
We got added to be involved 
and from our team's point of view,

615
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,750
I think some contract conditions 
need to be revised.

616
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,510
I'd like to discuss that 
before we start the meeting.

617
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,050
It will be? very 
sensitive in many ways.

618
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,900
I'd like to resolve things smoothly.

619
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,060
Young Yi.

620
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,330
Yes.

621
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,610
It's about export rights.

622
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,470
The share status changed after 
our team became involved.

623
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,930
I hope you can 
reconsider how we only have

624
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,230
the rights for the previous shares.

625
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,950
Samjung has an exclusive contract.

626
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,090
We performed explorations 
and geological surveys.

627
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,430
Yes, Samjung performed explorations 
and geological surveys,

628
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,190
but our Plant and Steel teams were

629
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,810
involved from early on 
and took the planning.

630
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,630
I don?t think 
our role was small.

631
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,650
The export rights were agreed upon 
during the original contract.

632
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,470
The agreement regarding export 
rights you're referring to

633
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,610
was before our 
Resource Team came in.

634
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,990
Please consider that our company 
is participating in the consortium

635
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,220
because of Samjung's 
lack of technology.

636
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,210
We would like to secure the

637
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,610
Southeast Asia and 
domestic markets.

638
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,750
Fine.

639
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,190
I'll consider that.

640
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,350
I'll tell you our Steel Team's opinion.

641
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,710
We'll approach this 
business in two ways.

642
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,150
One is procuring necessary steel parts

643
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,060
when establishing coal mining plants.

644
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,810
Next is after development?

645
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,900
Thank you.

646
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,200
Thank you.

647
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,770
The next meeting will be at Samjung.

648
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,530
I'll see you next time.

649
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,770
Yes.

650
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,190
Good job.

651
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,190
-Good job.
- Good job.

652
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,100
Let's talk.

653
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,590
Shin Woo Hyun.

654
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,790
Mr. Shin.

655
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,170
Sit down.

656
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,970
It won't take long, I have to 
go to a buyers' meeting soon.

657
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,150
I wouldn't have been so flustered 
if you'd told me in advance.

658
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,350
When I saw you in the One International

659
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,840
lobby, I thought you might work there.

660
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,590
But I didn't know you'd be in Resource.

661
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,910
I'm sorry.

662
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,290
How's work?

663
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,090
Things going ok?

664
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,450
Yes.

665
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:57,990
Is it fun?

666
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,590
Yes.

667
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,260
Ok, good.

668
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,970
It will be like today from now on also.

669
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,840
It's strictly business.

670
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,510
I don?t know.

671
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,390
I don?t feel comfortable 
around you yet.

672
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,410
Young Yi.

673
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:41,030
You did a good job today.

674
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,400
I don?t know who trained you

675
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,750
but he did a good job.

676
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,760
I don?t know who trained you

677
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,270
but he did a good job.

678
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,670
Good job.

679
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,250
Chinese or Arabian buyers 
don't expect a female buyer.

680
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:50,670
In any meeting with men, 
always sit in the middle.

681
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,960
Yes.

682
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,660
Mr. Shin.

683
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,990
Thank you.

684
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,950
Young Yi.

685
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,810
You're still working?

686
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,870
Yes.

687
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,960
Are you taking off?

688
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,860
Yes.

689
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,570
I'll get going.

690
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:39,550
Sure.

691
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,130
Baek Ki.

692
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,010
You want to go for a drink?

693
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,430
Why do you come home
 so late these days?

694
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,630
There's so much work.

695
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,250
I cleaned up your room.

696
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,290
I didn't throw out everything,

697
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,650
so you'll be able to find things.

698
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,550
I said I'd do it.

699
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,370
She put it upside-down.

700
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,230
It's Oppa.

701
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,230
[Oppa: Older male or older brother]

702
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,970
You want to go for a movie?

703
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,250
A close friend works for the movie.

704
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,350
No?

705
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,310
Ok, let's drink next time.

706
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,930
It's Oppa, hi.

707
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,010
I have tickets for a movie premiere.

708
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,670
7:00.

709
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,580
No?

710
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,740
9:00?
Hold on.

711
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,750
Hi, sir.

712
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,950
I called yesterday.

713
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,430
I won the event tickets.

714
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,660
Can I get 9:00 tickets instead?

715
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,970
No?

716
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,910
Why not?

717
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,970
I've started working in 
PR at a conglomerate.

718
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,970
You shouldn't do PR like that.

719
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,510
Yes.
Both of them, please.

720
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,380
Yes.

721
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,080
Yes.

722
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,590
A754? 8531.

723
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,870
7548531, thank you.

724
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,090
Bye.

725
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,710
Don't you have another one?

726
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,470
7548531?

727
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,830
Don't you have another one?

728
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,630
7548531?

729
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,680
Hey!

730
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,880
Now I know what's worst 
about company life.

731
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,000
Having to see someone 
you hate every day.

732
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,020
There are too many faults and lies.

733
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,600
He makes me so frigging mad!

734
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,900
But the fact that bosses 
like those guys better.

735
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,960
And the fact that he takes

736
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,520
credit for everything I do.

737
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,750
You want to fight?

738
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,820
How can a newbie fight?

739
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,520
Shouldn?t you wait for now?

740
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,460
What?

741
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,620
You should start with 
waiting for fights.

742
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,080
If the opponent is strong.

743
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,000
"Strong" my foot.

744
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,760
How strong could 
a deputy manager be?

745
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,540
You don?t know how to fight.

746
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,000
You have to hit them first.

747
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,760
You went for me first too.

748
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,510
You just have to be ready to quit.

749
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,540
This is just wrong!

750
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,440
Are you feeling ok?

751
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,540
What?

752
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,820
Yes.

753
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,080
You can really drink.

754
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,280
It seems your team keeps 
working all night.

755
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,960
Yes, we barely finished 
our Powerpoint work.

756
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,900
I guess only the draft 
and rehearsals are left.

757
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,080
Now it's going to get tough.

758
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,180
Yes.

759
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,330
Yes, now it's going to get tough.

760
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,940
How about giving some motion?

761
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,000
No, the conservative 
executives won't like it.

762
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,320
Sales Team 3, here we go.

763
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,340
Mr. Oh starts his rehearsal on the

764
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,100
Jordan business's outline 
and direction.

765
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,920
I will start our 
business report presentation.

766
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,740
Your voice.
A tone higher.

767
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,120
Ok.

768
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,390
We targeted?

769
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:57,450
The presentation pages Mr. Kim

770
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,670
prepared for the rehearsal were

771
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,200
revised, deleted, and put into order.

772
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,810
We checked expressions and

773
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,710
inappropriate breathing 
watching the screen.

774
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,220
We made a strategy to 
persuade everyone.

775
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,950
Wait, wait.

776
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,790
Surrounding Middle East countries

777
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:25,490
including Saudi Arabia, Iraq?

778
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,450
But I can't help feeling uneasy.

779
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,650
?to the big market.

780
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:42,890
What could be the problem?

781
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,430
Let's continue after eating.

782
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,530
The value, Middle East countries

783
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,030
including Iraq, domestic market?

784
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,590
Why's it so hard?

785
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,000
What?

786
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,910
You said you were so confident.

787
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:20,450
Am I really confident?

788
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,550
See?

789
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,550
I knew it.

790
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,130
Why aren't you eating, man?

791
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,050
Why are you here, Mr. Oh?

792
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,450
You said you had lunch plans.

793
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,570
You have something on your mind?

794
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,400
You didn't look happy.

795
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,910
I don't think we can 
persuade them with this.

796
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,310
You think it'll work?

797
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,530
You're not happy either?

798
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,550
No.

799
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:08,010
I'm not really happy either, 
but I think we'll be alright.

800
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,510
We've prepared thoroughly.

801
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,730
You must think it's not convincing

802
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,490
enough in other aspects.

803
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,590
Like stress or pressure.

804
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,290
Other psychological aspects.

805
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,480
I wonder if that's really it.

806
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,930
What's he doing?

807
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,590
He must be really stressed out.

808
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,710
I'm sorry.

809
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:12,750
This is the 15th floor 
of One International.

810
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,190
911?

811
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,290
We need an ambulance?

812
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,410
Come on.

813
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,310
What are you doing?
Is the season getting to you?

814
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,690
I'm getting coffee.

815
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,990
I have a new cologne, 
want to smell it?

816
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,410
What are you doing?
Get a grip.

817
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:55,590
Yes.

818
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,890
Mr. Kim.

819
00:53:58,890 --> 00:53:59,930
Yeah.

820
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,730
Last time, we were talking about work?

821
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,870
Yeah, you have something to tell me?

822
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,170
About the presentation?

823
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,070
What about it?

824
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,570
I feel uneasy about it 
for some reason.

825
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,470
Uneasy?

826
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,970
Who wouldn't feel 
so in this situation?

827
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:24,830
Yes, but I'm talking about 
the content as well.

828
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,410
What about it?

829
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,310
Well?

830
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:32,950
I think it shows how it could 
be bad for our business.

831
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,350
What do you mean?

832
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,070
Nothing, sir.

833
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,290
Go on.

834
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,590
He was just thinking out loud.

835
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,510
Go on!

836
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,170
Why do you think it shows 
how it could be bad?

837
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:06,020
That's?

838
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,030
?because our presentation is even

839
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,060
more like a manual than a manual.

840
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,070
It's perfect and that's a problem?

841
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:15,970
Yes.

842
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,270
You know?

843
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,910
A presentation starts with 
the business outline.

844
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,950
Since we're following that, we can't

845
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,580
help but sound like
 we're giving excuses.

846
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:42,770
So?

847
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:46,870
So instead of following
 the normal rules,

848
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:48,790
we should be radical?

849
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:51,510
Geu Rae.
That's not right.

850
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,610
Be radical?

851
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,070
Yes, so?

852
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,190
When you look at a map

853
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,030
I would say thinking

854
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,510
north goes up is a habit.

855
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,050
Wouldn't earth actually not

856
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,350
have an upside or down?

857
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,750
So?

858
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:26,400
Australia is down here.

859
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,530
If you go like this?

860
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,110
it can be in the middle.

861
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,310
You can see Australia well.

862
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,810
If you put it back to normal

863
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,490
you can't see it well.

864
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,550
Geu Rae.
That's?

865
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,150
Starting with the 
outline is a precedent.

866
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,590
If we focus too much 
on precedents,

867
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,390
what's important might 
not shine through.

868
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,270
Yes.

869
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:05,410
That might be it.

870
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,190
I kept feeling uneasy too.

871
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,410
Mr. Oh.

872
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,230
I don't know what he

873
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,510
means by being radical,

874
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:19,050
but if you're thinking 
of changing the content,

875
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,730
I'm against it.

876
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,110
You know, we really 
don't have time to revise it.

877
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,490
Mr. Oh, I agree with Mr. Kim.

878
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,530
I think we should choose and focus,

879
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,410
not be radical now.

880
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,870
I understand what Mr. Oh 
and Geu Rae are saying.

881
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,870
I do.

882
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:48,550
But I don't think it's problematic

883
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:51,470
to bring in a totally new alternative.

884
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,910
Geu Rae.

885
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,150
Go organize old reports.

886
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,160
Yes.

887
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:46,170
You agree you must be convinced 
to convince others, right?

888
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,340
I'm not convinced to begin with,

889
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,650
so it sounds like
 excuses as he said!

890
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:56,380
The audience will catch on.

891
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:04,090
Do you remember the folder 
structure made by Geu Rae?

892
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,620
We were trying to think 
within the structure,

893
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,830
but he didn't even think about it.

894
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,930
He just focused on the goal.

895
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,110
Instead of the team's existence,

896
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,270
cracks or saving face,

897
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:20,450
just focus on the goal 
of making this happen.

898
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,570
Whether we can take this road

899
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,870
or not.

900
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:43,690
Hi, Mr. Kim.

901
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:44,790
Geu Rae.

902
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:46,630
Come in.

903
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:03,430
Make the situation in your 
head into a Powerpoint file.

904
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,150
I'll give the presentation.

905
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,610
Show your picture.

906
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,330
Give it over by tomorrow morning.

907
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,710
We need time to revise it.

908
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,570
Mr. Kim, I?

909
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,110
Write out parts you think

910
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,790
will take time by computer.

911
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,600
This is absurd.

912
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:53,890
Sir.

913
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:56,390
What happened to Mr. Oh?

914
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,150
It's not the Mr. Oh Sang Sik I knew.

915
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,950
He didn't lack judgment like that.

916
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:08,330
He hasn't changed.

917
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,350
What about you, Dong Sik?

918
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:15,930
You have to leave this 
team to succeed.

919
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,180
- Sir.
- You know?

920
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,210
What are you talking about so seriously?

921
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,010
Your team must be so busy.

922
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,950
Is the presentation two days later?

923
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,230
Yes, sir.

924
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:35,730
I came to get some air 
and it's quiet out here.

925
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:41,390
When you're sitting at 
your desk all day,

926
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,870
you don't know when seasons change.

927
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:48,830
When you grow older, you feel

928
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,580
sad about losing the seasons.

929
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:57,220
See you later.

930
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,330
[Mail has been sent.]

931
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,120
Yes.

932
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:50,900
[Jang Geu Rae]

933
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,330
Geu Rae.

934
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:10,190
Hello.

935
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,590
- I finished this?
- I saw it.

936
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,870
You should go to a sauna.

937
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,930
I'll tell Mr. Oh when he comes.

938
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,360
Yes.

939
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,470
Mr. Kim.

940
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

941
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,190
I'm not so sure.

942
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,130
You're not wrong and

943
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:41,030
Mr. Oh had his concern too.

944
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:44,270
I understand the situation too.

945
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,630
If this doesn?t work out,

946
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,310
I think I'll be really 
mad at you, Geu Rae.

947
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:53,590
For a long time.

948
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,530
I'm sorry.

949
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,130
See you later.

950
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,870
Mr. Chun.

951
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:32,570
Mr. Oh.
Good morning.

952
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:35,570
Yes.

953
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,710
Good morning.

954
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:44,010
-Good morning.
-Hello.

955
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,530
Hi, are you revising it?

956
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:46,450
Yes.

957
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:49,070
Mr. Kim revised the presentation

958
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,780
file I worked on all night.

959
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:56,630
And rehearsals began.

960
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,390
[Amman, Jordan]

961
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,150
Check the satellite connection.

962
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:01,970
Mr. Cho, can you hear me?

963
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:04,090
Yes, I can.

964
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,810
Shall we start the screen test?

965
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:09,230
Yes, please sit in the vice 
president's seat for the test.

966
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:18,510
You're working so hard.

967
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:19,670
Vice president?

968
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,170
Hello, sir, how are you doing?

969
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,390
I'm good.

970
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,710
Since I drink less than in Korea.

971
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:27,490
That's nice.

972
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:31,330
What color clothes will 
you wear today?

973
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:34,670
I'll wear a light gray suit.

974
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,110
Will that be a problem?

975
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,650
That sounds good.

976
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:40,010
The company logo's location 
doesn?t look good.

977
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:41,830
Can you move a bit?

978
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:42,960
Is that ok?

979
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:47,490
It's good.

980
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,300
Mr. Oh.

981
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:52,530
It's a great business.

982
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:55,510
Thanks for not abandoning it.

983
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,630
Sure, we'll start the rehearsal.

984
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,030
We revised the presentation a bit.

985
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,310
Revise?

986
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:03,980
Yes, please look at the new file.

987
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:08,970
If you look at the second 
page, Indonesia?

988
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,860
Give me some water, I'm sorry.

989
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,670
I'm sorry.

990
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,740
After listening to Mr. Oh's 
final rehearsal, I kept quiet.

991
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,990
I've never seen rules I learned

992
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:40,180
in training shake in reality.

993
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:44,290
After seeing the radical change,

994
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:47,850
I realized I was a part 
of the change too.

995
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:50,730
And I became suspicious.

996
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:55,630
I returned to my trivial self.

997
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,810
-And?
-Mr. Oh.

998
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:01,690
Will that be ok?

999
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:04,440
Sir.

1000
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,450
I've never seen this 
kind of presentation.

1001
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:12,110
Am I wrong, Mr. Oh?

1002
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:15,650
Didn't you want to make 
this business happen?

1003
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:40,950
What have I done?

1004
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,790
What are you doing, Geu Rae?

1005
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,330
Praying?

1006
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:50,570
No, sir.

1007
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:52,790
Go in.

1008
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:54,790
Yes.

1009
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,360
[Misaeng]

1010
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:40,930
I don't think our team's 
business will work out.

1011
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,390
Why not?

1012
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:46,330
I think Mr. Oh is overdoing it.

1013
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:50,010
Gosh.

1014
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:51,640
That's too sad.
