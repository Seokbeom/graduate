Not Yet Alive

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,780
I told him he can't make it.

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,780
Empty hope,

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,890
and irresponsible 
consolation are useless.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,080
There are so many who are

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,460
desperate for that 
empty hope at least.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,340
Still? he can't make it.

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,630
A road with a dead end.

9
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,410
It's not that.

10
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,810
I just want to continue working.

11
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,750
With everyone I've worked with.

12
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,970
Us,

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,530
together,

14
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,870
always.

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,130
There's still a whole year left

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,070
that we can walk together.

[Episode 15]

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,190
Hello!

20
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,750
Hello!

21
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,260
You scared me.

22
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,260
What's with you?

23
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,130
I'll start working!

24
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,030
You look so energized 
these days, Geu Rae.

25
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,930
Brew some coffee from the 15th floor.

26
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,490
Or you could get them from a café.

27
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,070
Suk Yool.

28
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,410
Keep your chin up.

29
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,660
I told you to wait.

30
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,930
That's all we can do.

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,450
I've been there.

32
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,710
- Sang Hyun.
- If we just wait?

33
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,410
Baek Ki.
How are you?

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,890
Good, long time no see.

35
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,430
Let's have a drink if 
you're not busy today.

36
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,380
I'll be nearby.

37
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,210
- Uh, call me later.
- Bye.

38
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,990
- If we just wait?
- Give me the files.

39
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,530
I'll take a look before I go.

40
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,270
Oh, here.

41
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,930
Baek Ki.

42
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,610
"Shall" would be better 
than "must" here.

43
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,890
It adds a polite nuance to 
the sense of obligation.

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,330
But I thought we needed 
a stronger "must."

45
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,650
Alright then.

46
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,940
[must (x), shall (o)]

47
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,210
You have a hard life too.

48
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,410
- If we just wait?
- There's trouble, sir.

49
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,510
There's a hole in the ship.

50
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,970
What?

51
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,210
I don't think it's that bad.

52
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,590
Yes.

53
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,000
We'll find out and call you back.
Bye.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,460
What happened?

55
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,990
- Let's have a meeting in 20 minutes.
- Yes.

56
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,650
- Come with me.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,170
I don't know the details of the 
urgent call, but it won't sink.

58
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,590
- Where did it happen?
- Near Vietnam.

59
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,280
Call the company and you ask 
for updates in real time.

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,820
- Check my meeting schedule.
- Yes.

61
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,030
And Baek Ki, call the buyers.

62
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,270
- Never mind, I'll do it, just book a meeting room.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,730
This is Jang Baek Ki at
 One International.

64
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,950
There's a problem with our ship.

65
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,510
Yes.

66
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, can you check 
for any similar cases?

67
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,710
Thank you.
Bye.

68
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,810
Right around here.

69
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,470
These are the list of companies

70
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,180
- we could contact for worst case scenarios.
- Ok.

71
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,050
We can't send another ship there?

72
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,710
It's impossible due 
to the product's cost.

73
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,650
What about using a crane?

74
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,430
Vietnam's sea makes conditions tough,

75
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,860
so let's not think about that.

76
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,910
What about a tugboat?

77
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,600
You think tugboats just 
fall from the sky?

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,390
Everything will sink by 
the time we send them!

79
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,250
What's going on?

80
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,850
Steel is in trouble.

81
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,030
There's a hole in the 
ship they sent to Aquaba.

82
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,490
What's going on?

83
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,190
- Hello.
- Hi.

84
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,710
There's a hole in the ship?

85
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,910
Yes.

86
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,770
Mr. Kim.

87
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,740
There was ship trouble last year with 
Sales, how was it taken care of it?

88
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,430
They didn't depart long ago, so the 
products were loaded on a different ship.

89
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,910
Yeah?

90
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,110
Gosh, this is bad.

91
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,550
Let's go.

92
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,750
Can't you fill in the hole?

93
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,050
Geu Rae.

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,550
- Are you kidding?
- Yes.

95
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,770
You can fill it in.

96
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,650
Why take him so seriously?

97
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,330
No, I think it's good advice.

98
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,760
Yeah?

99
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,650
Let's go, come on.

100
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,790
You could be blamed.

101
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,970
Sir.

102
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,240
Ok.

103
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,150
What about filling in the hole?

104
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,410
What?
Is that possible?

105
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,110
If it's just a small 
crack, it'll be possible.

106
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,230
Well?

107
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,710
Let's send divers and 
check if it's a crack.

108
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,350
We can have welders stand 
by at nearby ports.

109
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,820
- Ok, let's do it.
- Yes.

110
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,250
Call a nearby branch and 
ask them to get welders.

111
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,260
Yes.

112
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,460
Kang Hae Joon, speaking.

113
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,170
Sir, this is Jang Baek 
Ki at One International.

114
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,440
We'll need welders and divers for?

115
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,690
Geu Rae.

116
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,810
Yes.

117
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,180
- Did you finish the weekly report?
- Yes.

118
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,050
Yes.

119
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,190
Did you check the Mongolia contract?

120
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,250
Yes.

121
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,010
The Japan rice wine B/L draft?

122
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,310
The rice wine B/L draft.

123
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,240
Why are you working so hard 
when you finished everything?

124
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,810
You told us to get the 
next business item ready.

125
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,070
I'm working on one too.

126
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,510
- You'll do it alone?
- Yes.

127
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,290
You've never done an item alone.

128
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,170
Then maybe I shouldn't?

129
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,550
No, go ahead.

130
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,920
Yes.
Thank you.

131
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,510
Mr. Yoo.

132
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,340
I've uploaded the Norway mineral 
case in the shared folder.

133
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,340
Ok.
Print out a copy for me too.

134
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,380
Yes, sir.

135
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,280
[Mom]

136
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,490
I'll call you back soon.

137
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,750
What?

138
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,470
What can we do?

139
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,010
I couldn't dissuade your dad again.

140
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,070
Young Yi.

141
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,270
What do you mean what we should do?

142
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,770
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,670
What does dad's business and taking the

144
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,630
early rent deposit have to do with me?

145
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,510
Mom.

146
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm barely sane now.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,510
You know how I've lived for the past

148
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,970
half-year after he borrowed money.

149
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,610
You told me to live my life.

150
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,050
The landlord said we can pay monthly.

151
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,430
I just ask you for 
the security deposit.

152
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,190
- I can?
- Mom!

153
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,930
We don't have anywhere to go now.

154
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,630
I don't have money.

155
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,020
I barely paid off the debt.

156
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,290
I can barely breathe now!

157
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,130
It's barely over now!

158
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,530
I can't do it.

159
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,030
Mr. Oh.

160
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,770
Did you want something from me?

161
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,070
Nope.

162
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,230
Oh, OK.

163
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,050
Steel team.

164
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,210
Hello.

165
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,160
I heard there was 
trouble, are things ok?

166
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,450
Yes, thanks to Geu Rae.

167
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,450
What did he do?

168
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,410
Fortunately it's a small crack 
and we can fill it in as he said.

169
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,530
So we're resolving the issue now.

170
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,430
That's not thanks to Geu 
Rae, but all the workers.

171
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,730
He just happened to think of an idea.

172
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,690
So that means he's really competent.

173
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,250
Some people know how to 
resolve issues like him.

174
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,230
Come on, that's ridiculous.

175
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,290
- See you later.
- See you later, sir.

176
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,030
One International, Jang Baek?

177
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,510
Yes, sir.

178
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,570
I'm glad to hear that.

179
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,050
We will receive a call as 
soon as the ship is repaired.

180
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,080
- That's the status and additional costs.
- Thank you.

181
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,570
Mr. Han said the first 
filling is complete.

182
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,310
And the divers are on 
stand by as you asked for.

183
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,290
I think if there's another crack, we 
can repeat welding with it anchored.

184
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,290
I'll secure an area just in case.

185
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,490
Ok.

186
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,630
That was so stressful.

187
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,000
What would we have 
done without Geu Rae?

188
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,170
Geez.

189
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,190
Hello.

190
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,610
Hi, Geu Rae.

191
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,970
- Mr. Song asked me to give this to you.
- Thanks.

192
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,950
- Thanks for before.
- What?

193
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,190
Welding.

194
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,520
I crossed my line.

195
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,310
Keep up the good work.

197
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,550
Pardon?

198
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,280
Some people know how to 
resolve issues like him.

199
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,490
Keep up the good work.

200
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,170
Is this yours?

201
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,880
If you

202
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,530
have time to worry about others,

203
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,760
you should work on your own flaws.

204
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,590
You shouldn't butt in 
others' business too much.

205
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,230
Okay.

206
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,370
Thank you for the advice.

207
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,460
If you

208
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,600
have time to worry about others,

209
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,630
you should work on your own flaws.

210
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,160
Please, Baek Ki.

211
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,520
Alright.

212
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,580
I'll ask Auditing for you.

213
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,450
Thank you.

214
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,080
I don't deserve that.

215
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Look!

216
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,660
Gone insane now?

217
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,080
Oh, new item, you're 
clearly something else?

218
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,600
Gosh.

219
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,340
You shouldn't look at 
others' stuff like that.

220
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,740
I should go to the field.

221
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,140
What?

222
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,240
Why?

223
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,700
Here,

224
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,980
I mean at this company, 
there's nothing I can change.

225
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,480
Changing your boss's irrationality 
isn't accepted either.

226
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,090
You need to wait to fight 
with a stronger opponent?

227
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,860
Until when?

228
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm most scared

229
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,830
about waiting until 
I become a jerk like him.

230
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,640
I'm sure he wasn?t like 
that in the beginning.

231
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,780
If you're not insane, why are 
you smiling by yourself?

232
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,190
There's a distance you can't do 
anything about no matter what you do.

233
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,360
Baek Ki?

234
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,920
If you get a step closer, you're

235
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,360
two steps further the next day.

236
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,260
He's always like that.

237
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,800
Right.

238
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,900
[Oh Bong Ja Salon]

239
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,900
What?
That Geu Rae?

240
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,040
He was a disaster.

241
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,740
Life is so unfair.

242
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,260
He got in, passed tests, 
and fired people

243
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,140
he didn?t like all through 
connections.

244
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,520
He got an item through connections too?

245
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,250
That's not really true, Sang Hyun.

246
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,780
My gosh?

247
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,430
Slow down.

248
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,900
People like me is disadvantaged
 because of ditchers like him!

249
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Why do you think I failed?

250
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,620
Ok, let's say it might 
not have been me.

251
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,040
Still,

252
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,960
one of us were sacrificed for his spot.

253
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,260
He did a good job with the presentation.

254
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,400
Yeah, right.

255
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,300
Stammering and selling those 
absurd dirty slippers?

256
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,460
Gosh, he made it with that.

257
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,500
It all proves how 
strong his connections are.

258
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,100
I can say Suk Yool is competent, 
but not that jerk.

259
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,110
You should be honest too.

260
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,050
You think Geu Rae is one of us?

261
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,210
I hope you don't.

262
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,420
He's not in our league.

263
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,840
"Fair opportunity" my foot.

264
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,090
How can we share fair 
opportunities with him?

265
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,540
My mom spent so much on 
tutors and cram schools!

266
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,430
She worked so hard!

267
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,070
This is reverse discrimination.

268
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,900
I should've enjoyed my life too.

269
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,320
I never slept before midnight 
all throughout school.

270
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,260
Elementary school?

271
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,860
I went to so many cram 
schools and in college?!

272
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,180
I studied abroad too.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,160
But

274
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,580
what's this?

275
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,720
Huh?

276
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,260
How's your company?

277
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,140
It's just temporary.

278
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,780
I'll go to a conglomerate.

279
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,960
Baek Ki.

280
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,960
You know what?

281
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,840
In order to keep our position,

282
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,960
we need to work for a conglomerate.

283
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,670
So how's Geu Rae doing now?

284
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,380
This proposal has to be as 
professional as possible.

285
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,450
I created a proposal according 
to the company's manual

286
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,960
with professional terms suiting

287
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,680
the business direction and 
the reasonable vision.

288
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,040
Well, I don't know.

289
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm not sure, but it feels 
different this time.

290
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,070
Mr. Oh said only my conviction

291
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,070
 is important in persuading others.

292
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,120
I have conviction this time.

293
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,360
Geu Rae.

294
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
You must be confident.

295
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
No, sir.

296
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,440
You worked hard past office hours.

297
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,990
I'm sure you did well.

298
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,160
Well,

299
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,700
I just did my best.

300
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,780
Your best only works in school.

301
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,400
At work, only the results count.

302
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,340
Geu Rae has distinct ideas.

303
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
He sure does.

304
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,940
Once in a while.

305
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,750
What's up with him again?

306
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,320
Stop putting him up on a pedestal.

307
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,300
I'll see you later.

308
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,480
- I'll see you later, Geu Rae.
- Yes.

309
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,960
Let's see your distinct idea,

310
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,020
though I don't have any expectations.

311
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,860
As you see, the contamination 
of famous tourist sites is

312
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,800
increasing each year.

313
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,520
And the future of the world's 
automobile business is

314
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,940
also heading towards 
low-emission vehicles.

315
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,970
We can expect environment conservation

316
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,240
acts in popular tourist sites including

317
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,380
the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Grand Canyon

318
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,720
in the US, and Australia's Opera House.

319
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,890
So the electric car rental 
and sales business which will

320
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,960
lead to growth for the next generation 
will clearly be lucrative.

321
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,030
That's all for my presentation.

322
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,120
You're not really smart at all.

323
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,140
What?

324
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,580
You said you'd bring up 
a business item.

325
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,210
What's with all this?

326
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,480
You don?t even know these terms.

327
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,160
Why'd you use English when 
you're not good at it?

328
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,300
What are you trying to sell?

329
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,860
To whom?

330
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,560
I have no idea what you're saying.

331
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,960
But it doesn't sound like an amateur.

332
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,220
Talk doesn't come first.

333
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,080
If you

334
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,940
have time to worry about others,

335
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,920
you should work on your own flaws.

336
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,080
Young Yi.

337
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,180
Did you give me the printouts?

338
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,340
Did you?

339
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,560
Young Yi!

340
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,660
Printouts.

341
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,500
What printouts?

342
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,800
The Norway case!

343
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,700
Yes, I'll request it.

344
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,560
What?

345
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,200
You said you requested 
it and it came yesterday.

346
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,440
What?

347
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,760
When did I say that?

348
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,980
What's wrong with you?

349
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,450
Oh, the Norway case, sorry.

350
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,280
Gosh, look at that mess.

351
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,600
Print it out for him first.

352
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,680
Yes.

353
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,400
She's going out to print it out?

354
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,680
To the copier.

355
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,800
Why'd she become Geu Rae
 all of a sudden?

356
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,300
You wanted printouts, right?

357
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,380
Yeah.

358
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,690
Young Yi.

359
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,220
Is something wrong?

360
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,220
No.

361
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,060
It seems something's wrong.

362
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,260
No, everything's fine.

363
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,640
Geu Rae must've really 
wanted to do well.

364
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,400
He overdid it, didn't he?

365
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,140
Shall we just end it like that?

366
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,080
Shouldn't we tell him what's wrong?

367
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,840
Tell him what?

368
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,420
You've been treating 
Geu Rae differently this year.

369
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
How so?

370
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,840
No way.

371
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,100
He's a good employee.

372
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,760
It's a shame.

373
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,870
It'll be hard, won't it?

374
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,370
Him working full-time?

375
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,370
It'll be hard.

376
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,210
Then he'll have to start preparing.

377
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,800
There will be a position for him where

378
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,780
he can use what he learned here.

379
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,380
The landlord said we can pay monthly.

380
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,980
I just ask you for 
the security deposit.

381
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,620
I can?

382
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,500
We don't have anywhere to go now.

383
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,640
No way.

384
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,080
I won't do it this time.

385
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,140
Yes, sir.

386
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,930
Yes.

387
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,930
Young Yi.

388
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,180
Read the third point 
in the Norway contract.

389
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,370
Yes.

390
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,970
Now.

391
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,100
Yes.

392
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,370
Please wait a minute.

393
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,980
The number?

394
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,820
- What are you doing?
- Yes.

395
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,490
Hurry up.

396
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,870
Why's it taking all day?

397
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,060
What are you doing?

398
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,920
- Sorry, I can't remember it.
- 2875.

399
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,080
Why, you guys?

400
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,540
What are you doing?

401
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,060
Give it to me!

402
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,730
I'm so sorry.

403
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,080
Dang!

404
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,670
It'll be hard, won't it?

405
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,280
Him working full-time?

406
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,280
It'll be hard.

407
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,780
Then he'll have to start preparing.

408
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,180
There will be a position for him where

409
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,460
he can use what he learned here.

410
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,980
All throughout my life!

411
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,390
You know how I've lived 
because of you, Dad.

412
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,700
How?

413
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,960
How could you ask for money again?

414
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,420
What did I do wrong to you?

415
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,620
I said I'm sorry.

416
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,000
I'd be so grateful for the

417
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,370
money during these hard times.

418
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,240
This is really the last time.

419
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,780
I always wanted a son, but 
have I ever treated you badly?

420
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,900
Daughters are children too.

421
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,950
Dad!

422
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,050
Come on, help me out one last time.

423
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,040
Don't ever call me again.

424
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,260
Young Yi, I was just?

425
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,400
I wonder what's wrong with her today.

426
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,970
It's strange.

427
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,970
Maybe something bad has happened.

428
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,000
Why worry about her?

429
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,580
I don?t want to, but?

430
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,780
You can't help it since we 
work together every day.

431
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,040
Young Yi.

432
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,300
What's wrong?

433
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,960
Nothing, sir.

434
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,640
Young Yi.
Is something wrong at home?

435
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,360
- You've been?
- No.

436
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,080
Don?t worry.

437
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,670
Take care of your personal 
affairs before you come to work!

438
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,570
Don't make a mess at work 
so we don't have to work!

439
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,080
Come on.

440
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,210
Geez.

441
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,040
Don't you think you went too much?

442
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,890
Actually we can't even care for her.

443
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,100
She built a thick wall around herself.

444
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,260
Get away, I don't want to talk about it.

445
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,160
Geez.

446
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,740
You can't climb stairs 
without a foundation.

447
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,900
You can't ultimately climb stairs with

448
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,670
success where there's no foundation.

449
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,100
You end up on the ground again.

450
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,750
Shouldn't we tell him what's wrong?

451
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,540
Geu Rae.

452
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,580
Yes?

453
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,530
It's $100.

454
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,100
Go sell anything out there.

455
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,600
You want a cool business, right?

456
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,860
Business?

457
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,280
Don't be fancy, it's just selling stuff.

458
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,540
Making a profit after 
buying it cheap.

459
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,080
Buying good items and selling 
it to people who need it.

460
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,140
Go find out the basics 
of selling stuff.

461
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,260
Exclude your family.

462
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,720

463
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,840
What a long title.

464
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,350
How did he do to get rejected?

465
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,040
He deserved it.

466
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,560
Hello?

467
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
How are you?

468
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,340
I checked the email.

469
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,060
But the price won't work, 
so I'll tell Mr. Oh.

470
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,860
But I think it'll be tough.

471
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,860
I'll let you know after checking.

474
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,110
Bye.

475
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,080
What's with me?

476
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,480
You want to smell my new cologne?

477
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,240
- It's no fun.
- Ok.

478
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,360
Baek Ki.

479
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,980
You shouldn't look at that.

480
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,520
I'm sorry.

481
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,120
I just happened to?

482
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,680
It's not confidential.

483
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,930
Geu Rae just got in trouble 
for it, so it's embarrassing.

484
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,720
But

485
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,000
it's not that bad.

486
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
Why??

487
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,340
You tell him since you've read it.

488
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
What?

489
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,060
Yeah, tell me your opinion.

490
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,680
Yes.

491
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,380
I think?

492

Automobile inventory handling and

495
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,400
depreciation strategies aren't either.

496
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,080
And

497
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,060
the part on profits is quite abstract.

498
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,200
Since simulation should be redone,

499
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,210
this proposal has to be rewritten.

500
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,720

501
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,880
Probably.

502
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Tell him to take Baek Ki too.

503
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,640
What?

504
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,580
Why should I??

505
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,340
Where shall we go?

506
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,410
Baek Ki.

507
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,260
Shouldn't we decide what to buy first?

508
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,860
Then what should we buy?

509
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,540
How should I know?

510
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
Anyway let's go where we can buy items.

511
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,120
Yes, where?

512
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,590
That's what we're trying to decide.

513
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,260
You buy anything you want.

514
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,430
It's your homework, not mine.

515
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,430
I'll sell anything for you?

516
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,330
Come to that café over there.

517
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,620
Hello.

518
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,140
How are you?

519
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,220
Hi, Baek Ki.
It's been a while.

520
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,980
How's work?

521
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,660
Good.

522
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,520
How's your business going?

523
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,130
Come on, leasing service 
is no business.

524
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,760
It's nothing fancy.

525
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,800
I just took over from my family.

526
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,300
We should go for a drink.

527
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,170
Yes.

528
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,360
So can I visit you today?

529
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Why ask?

530
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,180
You're welcome to come anytime.

531
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,780
Yes.

532
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,510
See you later.

533
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,190
I wonder how Geu Rae's doing now.

534
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,440
I hope he learns something.

535
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,100
As he gets in trouble out there,

536
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,900
he'll learn why his report failed.

537
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,180
I wonder what he'll sell.

538
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,220
I had a hard time deciding what 
to sell with this mission too.

539
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,840
I went to this store 
and that like crazy.

540
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,500
$10, it's practically free!

541
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,050
So I thought I'd buy something

542
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,100
cheap that everyone will use.

543
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,120
[8 pairs of socks or 5
 underwear for $10]

544
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,840
Buying something cheap and 
selling a lot of them.

545
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,620
Yeah, that's the trap.

546
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,020
That's cheap.

547
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,240
You'd think buying something cheap

548
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,460
and selling a lot of them would work.

549
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,140
That's the trap of this mission.

550
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,180
Choose a nice one.

551
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,340
Sir, do these socks sell well?

552
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,300
Of course, they're less than half-price 
of what you buy at markets.

553
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:40,360
And you can see how durable it is.

554
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,320
Look.

555
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,380
8 pairs of socks or

556
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,340
5 underwear for $10!

557
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,700
Sir, I'll get $100 worth.

558
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,760
- $100?
- Yes.

559
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,300
Just socks?

560
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,400
Just underwear?

561
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,100
Half half, please.

562
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,700
- Hi, Mr. Kim.
- Geu Rae.

563
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,140
How's it going?

564
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,880
I've just started.

565
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,950
Break the record for highest profit.

566
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,180
Buy it cheap and earn big money.

567
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,320
Yes.

568
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,760
Then will we be able to 
party with that profit?

569
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,030
Yes.

570
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,030
Good luck.

571
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,120
He keeps saying "yes."

572
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,520
I hope he didn't buy 
those cheap cart socks.

573
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,060
The full package with underwear.

574
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,520
I can't even drink 
water in front of you.

575
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,300
So scary.

576
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,980
Did you reflect yourself well?

577
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,600
Will you drop it, guys?

578
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,490
All the newbies attack their 
bosses like this at first.

579
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,100
I'll train him well.

580
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,520
Do a good job please.

581
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,240
Gosh, I'm sorry.

582
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,760
Bring it.

583
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,200
It's the inventory status file.

584
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,450
Do it over.

585
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,460
What part wasn't done properly?

586
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,940
You study it or ask the noticeboard.

587
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,940
Answer that.

588
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,950
Yes, Fabric?

589
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,950
I'll put him on.

590
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,880
It's Chungsol Fabric.

591
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,420
Mr. Lee.

592
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,240
My cell was turned off.

593
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,900
Where?

594
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,780
I'll call you back now.

595
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,450
You're a new employee.

596
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,760
You can get company
 loans after a year.

597
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,640
New employees aren't allowed yet.

598
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,900
Here you go.

599
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,000
You can withdraw up to $10,000.

600
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,500
Where is she all day 
when we have to do this?

601
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,220
Norway budget?

602
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,400
Give it to me.

603
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,560
I'll do it.

604
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,230
Where have you been?

605
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,960
I'm sorry.

606
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Mr. Yoo is doing your job!

607
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,300
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,200
I'm sorry.

609
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,380
Young Yi.

610
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,880
Can't you hear the phone?

611
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
Resource?

612
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,480
Resource Team 2
 Yoo Hyung Gi speaking.

613
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,220
Total budget for the Norway business?

614
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,060
Yes, it'll be ready by today.

615
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,440
Don?t worry.

616
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,240
Yes.
Bye.

617
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,730
You said everything's fine.

618
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,670
This is fine?

619
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,300
Your mind's not on work 
and making a mess?

620
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,770
What, don?t worry about it?

621
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,780
Young Yi.
Go have some coffee.

622
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Hey!
You didn't hear her?

623
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,360
She said don?t worry about it!

624
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,960
Hey, Mr. Ha!

625
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,360
I'm sorry.

626
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,610
What's this?

627
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,780
Socks and underwear.

628
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,820
You said you'd sell anything I buy.

629
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,920
Let's go.

630
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,560
Where are we going?

631
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,900
Hello.

632
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,280
Hi, Baek Ki.

633
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,880
Long time no see.

634
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,540
- How are you?
- Good.

635
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,900
- Bring us some tea.
- Sure.

636
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,100
Thanks.

637
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,900
Baek Ki.

638
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,900
You're looking good.

639
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,100
I'm Jang Geu Rae of 
One International.

640
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,880
Nice to meet you.

641
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,180
Take good care of Baek Ki.

642
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,560
Sit down.

643
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,860
I'm still sorry about

644
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
the treat for getting my job.

645
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,980
It was over $1,000.

646
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,280
Come on.

647
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,200
I love feeding my juniors.

648
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,760
What is the favor you
 want to ask of me?

649
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,580
My company wants me 
to sell something.

650
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,440
- It's like practical training.
- What is it?

651
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,360
Uh?

652
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,020
You know?

653
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,500
This.

654
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
It'd be nice if you buy them high.

655
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,440
Thank you.

656
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,790
Thank you.

657
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,630
Is this your company's product?

658
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,000
Oh, no.

659
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,360
We bought it on the way here.

660
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,140
Where is it made by?

661
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,470
China OEM?

662
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,420
Probably so.

663
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,960
How much will you sell it for?

664
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,060
I'll give you a good deal?

665
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,410
Why a good deal?

666
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,400
Since you know me?

667
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,600
Or since the quality is low?

668
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Uh?

669
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,780
I won't buy them.

670
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,960
I can buy you drinks and more.

671
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,660
But I won't buy these.

672
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,280
You know why?

673
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,660
Since I don't need it.

674
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,000
Baek Ki.

675
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,440
Are you sure you bought 
this to sell it to me?

676
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,280
Then I'm disappointed.

677
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,980
How could you buy 
something like this?

678
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,230
You told me to buy anything.

679
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,000
We'll be able to sell it 
where there are many people.

680
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,560
Baek Ki.

681
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,420
Just go back if you can't do it.

682
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,740
As you said, it's my homework and

683
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,450
as you said, I have a lot of flaws.

684
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,080
So I have many more
 desperate moments.

685
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,160
I have to sell this within 
Mr. Oh's deadline today.

686
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,300
How's it going?

687
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:36,340
You can't sell 
products in the subway?

688
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,380
Let's go, this won't work.

689
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,660
No.

690
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,360
Let's sell it here.

691
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,790
Geu Rae.

692
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,780
I said before we'll go where 
there are many people.

693
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,090
Look.

694
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,760
You said we couldn't sell 
it out on the streets.

695
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,820
We have to sell it here.

696
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,820
I can't sell it here.

697
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,440
Why not?

698
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,970
All the people are staring.

699
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,460
Let's go somewhere else, please.

700
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,500
There's no time.

701
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,260
The subway is the best.

702
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,700
Many people come and go, 
so we'll go through?

703
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,380
If you're so confident,

704
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,960
you sell it on your own.

705
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,320
Hello.

706
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,880
Hello, everyone.

707
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,740
Don?t you... need socks?

708
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,320
Take a look.

709
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,000
Six pairs for $10.

710
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,290
They're very elastic and much 
cheaper than the markets.

711
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,890
Take a look.

712
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,200
Please take a look.

713
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,760
People of all genders 
and ages can wear them.

714
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,060
Both guys and girls can 
wear them, so take a look.

715
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,460
Please take a look.

716
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,660
How much is it?

717
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,720
$10, sir.

718
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,200
They're great quality.

719
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,200
- For how many?
- Six pairs for $10.

720
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,050
It's really cheap for six pairs.

721
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,450
You want to feel it?

722
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,760
Want to see another product?

723
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,060
Your family can wear them together.

724
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,390
I don't need it.

725
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,960
They'll like it.

726
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,120
I don't need it.

727
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,880
Ma'am, I'll show you some socks.

728
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,760
They're one size and?

729
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,480
I said I don't need it.

730
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,690
As you said, I have a lot of flaws.

731
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,420
So I have many more 
desperate moments.

732
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,670
I have to sell this within 
Mr. Oh's deadline today.

733
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,520
Six pairs for $10.

734
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,640
Ma'am, I'll show you some socks.

735
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,820
Aren't you being too greedy?

736
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,040
Are you jealous of someone who 
struggled from the bottom?

737
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,960
- Here.
- Yes, would you like them?

738
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,100
Sorry.

739
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,280
- Would you like some socks?
- I don't need it.

740
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,000
They're made in China and 
they're great quality.

741
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,220
Made in China?

742
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,140
They're made in China 
with Korean quality.

743
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,820
You can feel the difference.

744
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,640
Come on.

745
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,680
I'm selling this and you'll 
see they're different?

746
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,700
- How much is it?
- Oh, $10.

747
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,700
Six pairs for $10.

748
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,980
- Six pairs for $10?
- Yes.

749
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,700
The cute characters?

750
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,340
It's too expensive.

751
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,520
It's not expensive.

752
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
It's usually 10 pairs for $10.

753
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,720
You can't buy six pairs 
for $10 elsewhere.

754
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,060
- It's okay.
- I'll give you one more.

755
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,580
It's okay, one more is nothing.

756
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,100
- I'll give you one more, only you.
- I don't need it.

757
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,230
- Just you.
- I don't need it.

758
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,840
I said I don't need it!

759
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,220
Geez!

760
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:21,710
Who pays $10 for subway sales?

761
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,960
So why'd you work so hard 
without being smart?

762
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,340
I guess you'll have 
to work hard at least.

763
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,680
Keep working hard.

764
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,480
Please wait here.

765
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,620
Where will you go?

766
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,240
I'll sell it.

767
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,020
- Where?
- Stay here.

768
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,400
Geu?

769
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,600
Having a memory is wonderful.

770
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:25,230
[Korea Go Institute]

771
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,830
But they say forgetting 
is truly wonderful.

772
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,020
What you can forget

773
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,780
is no longer a wound.

774
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,740
I came in.

775
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,060
As with all games,

776
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,840
you realize you're not ready

777
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,860
the moment you start to play.

778
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,110
Strong resolutions and 
shouts before that

779
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,940
are intuition signs of anxiety.

780
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,800
When you want to run away,

781
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,820
it means it's too late

782
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,140
or you?ve already started playing.

783
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,420
Captain.

784
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,010
Geu Rae.

785
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,410
How are you?

786
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,810
Good.

787
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,250
Where is he?

788
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,950
Go?

789
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,730
Why'd he come here?

790
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,630
Does he know anyone here?

791
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:08,860
Go?

792
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,830
I couldn't do it right then.

793
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,150
Did you see?
Geu Rae's here.

794
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,600
-Really?
- Really?

795
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,490
Yeah.

796
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,970
He must got a job somewhere.

797
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,410
He's wearing a suit.

798
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,230
Geu Rae?

799
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,310
I never thought he'd 
set foot here again.

800
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,350
But he's here?

801
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:26,510
Yeah.

802
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,090
I heard you work for a trading company.

803
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:36,010
Sungwon's CEO helped me out.

804
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,350
Yeah.

805
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,610
He really liked you.

806
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,350
How's work?

807
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,550
- Good.
- That's great.

808
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:46,660
But what brings you here?

809
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,290
Uh?

810
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,850
My boss gave me a mission.

811
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,170
Mission?

812
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,350
Yes, I have to sell these.

813
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,890
I was wondering if 
I could sell them here.

814
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,510
According to the rule of games,

815
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,910
everything goes forward.

816
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,490
They're underwear and socks.

817
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,430
Even if hell is at the end.

818
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,430
Geu Rae.

819
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,580
Yes.

820
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,050
You shouldn't have come here.

821
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:25,970
Because

822
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,450
everyone here will buy it for you

823
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:35,370
out of sympathy or encouragement.

824
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,110
Then you couldn't say you 
pulled the mission off.

825
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:46,230
Exclude your family.

826
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,390
Your boss won't want

827
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,220
you to do this either.

828
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,950
Right.

829
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,030
Geu Rae was so good, it's a shame.

830
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:27,570
We thought he'd be 
the first to become a pro.

831
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,850
He's much better than Pro Kim.

832
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,420
It's a shame.

833
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,420
He started at seven, right?

834
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,910
That's too late to become a pro.

835
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,070
But he became a student in a year,

836
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:44,400
he beat Lee Se Chang
 in grade school and

837
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,970
he always excelled in 
competitions especially.

838
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:49,490
He was a good student too.

839
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,410
When he quit high school, I saw the

840
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,910
teacher come and 
dissuade our master.

841
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:58,470
He could've made it if it weren't 
for his financial situation.

842
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,670
I heard he even had 
part-time jobs at dawn too.

843
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,690
It seemed he came to ask a favor.

844
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:06,820
He must not have wanted to come.

845
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:10,170
How could you after giving up on Go?

846
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,630
-It must be hurt.
- It must be hurt.

847
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,250
Sir.

848
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,930
I'll get going.

849
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,380
Bye.

850
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,770
Geu Rae.

851
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:42,790
Yes.

852
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,790
What is it?

853
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,270
You couldn't sell a single pair?

854
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,130
I'm sorry.

855
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,450
If we go in, it'll be past 7PM.

856
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:09,410
Yes.

857
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:13,640
Let's go.

858
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:00,690
Suk Yool.

859
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,330
Working late?

860
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,890
Yes.

861
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,250
Bye.

862
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,590
Shall we have a cup of tea?

863
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:19,050
Hang in there.

864
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,870
Mr. Lee.

865
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:52,250
Can you check on previous cases

866
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,980
of Sales employees with GEDs?

867
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,190
Excuse me?

868
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,590
I haven't seen any so far.

869
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,690
Mr. Oh.

870
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,370
Sit down.

871
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,130
Your whole team seemed 
to be working late.

872
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,210
Why aren't you having dinner with them?

873
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:29,070
I thought you were getting along,

874
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,970
but you're an outcast again?

875
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:33,790
Shall I trip him again?

876
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,190
No.

877
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,450
I made a mistake.

878
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,710
Mistake?

879
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,870
What mistake did you make?

880
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,650
It's all their fault.

881
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,510
It's always their fault.

882
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:51,450
I was flustered earlier.

883
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,770
Earlier?

884
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:56,130
Earlier when?

885
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:09,750
Everything becomes a mess

886
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:12,750
when it involves my dad.

887
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:22,690
Aren't you going home?

888
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,630
This kid has to come home first.

889
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,270
It's almost 7PM.

890
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:31,630
I heard Geu Rae and Baek Ki
 went to sell items.

891
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:34,910
Yeah, hopefully they'll 
sell at least one.

892
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,970
I don't know what it is,

893
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,970
but I'm sure they will.

894
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,970
You know Geu Rae.

895
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,570
Right?

896
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,250
Yes.

897
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:13,130
Can you just go back like this?

898
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:15,310
Geu Rae.

899
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,850
I have no choice.

900
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,510
Hey!

901
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,570
Are you ok?

902
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,410
[Sauna]

903
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,950
I'm so tired.

904
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,470
I'll go rest at the sauna nearby.

905
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:58,520
[Go Room included]

906
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,470
Put me on if a buyer calls.

907
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:59,850
I'll be at the sauna.

908
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:03,210
I can't go home and come back.

909
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,750
I'll sleep at the sauna.

910
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:07,510
Geu Rae.

911
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,930
I have to wear this underwear again?

912
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:14,030
If I knew I'd go to the sauna, 
I would've brought a new pair from home.

913
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,010
Geu Rae.

914
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,510
- Here.
- What?

915
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,110
Where are you going?

916
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,050
Drink this.

917
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,210
What?
