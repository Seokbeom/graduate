You didn't like that nice suit

Your concerns are leading to results.

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,200
It's a good thing it didn't 
lead to disappointment.

20
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,350
Poshin joined the national 
solar energy business recently.

21
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,200
So the variable isn't reflected

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,540
in the solar panel business.

23
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,360

show what you've got.

Yes, sir.

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,060
Why me?

I'm asking you because 
you're Oh Sang Sik.

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,610

controlling the original costs

Mr. Oh.

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,580
I'd do anything you want to do.

56
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,920
But the fact that they might not get

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,360
the power plant business is what

58
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,900
you're concerned about too.

59
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,440
Yeah, as of now.

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,100
As of now?

61
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,030
There's a way to eliminate 
the risk factors.

62
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,800
The Chinese government wants quality 
solar panels and facilities.

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,160
They want a company that does much

64

business and can handle
 a big development.

65
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,980
From Poshin's position,

66
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,960
the more solar panels they have,

67
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,720
the higher their chances 
to get the business.

68
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,880
The more solar panels they have?

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,150
Hold on.

70
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,480
But why did the company before

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,940
have such a small scale?

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,460
Since it wasn't linked to 
the power plant business.

73
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,260
Things changed recently.

74
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,280
So it depends on how we do?

75
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,870
So we actually have the upper

76
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,740
hand regarding connections.

77
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,900

by "connections?"

It's better if you don't know it.

95
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,180

the business manual.

Geu Rae isn't like a 
pure, organic being.

They say in China, connections 
come first in business.

98
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,100
For the Chinese, personal relationships

99
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,120
are more important than the law.

100

No, I bought it on sale,

so don't worry.

167
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,480
But you hadn't worn it,

168
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,660
so I thought you didn't like it.

Mr. Sung contemplated on that.

184
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,200

185
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,940
of another delay by the contract.

But he added it in the contract.

189
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,200
Gosh, you're so meticulous.

190
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,030
Is that true?

191
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,470
Are you my superior or something?

192
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,120
Am I obligated to report 
such things to you?

193
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,980
Go check the contract.

194
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,220
What?

195
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,080
You can't believe it, right?

196
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,990
It upsets you to see me acknowledge

197
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,640
the delays and do that?

198
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,930
I have much more experience

199
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,720
than you, dude.

200
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,330
No matter how hard you try,

201
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,100
you can't beat me, you know.

202
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,870
What a joke.

203
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,730
I've seen you drink 
during lunch before.

204
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,600
Now you don't?

205
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,740
I don't think it'll be 
helpful for work later.

206
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,720
Just drink a little.

207
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,540
Yes, sir.

208
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,320
Partner management could

209
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,220
be the core to work.

210
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,760
They say it has changed, but China

211
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,790
is still all about connections.

212
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,960
It works despite the views on it.

213
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,470
I lived in China for five years.

214
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,900
All my Chinese partners 
are on their own now.

215
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,570
They're all doing well.

216
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,740
I think businesses should 
be based at facilities.

217
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,980
The fulfillment?

218
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,040
Those you leave at some point
after making profit

219
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,820
are no good anymore.

220
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,650
It should go for a lifetime.

221
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,190
You should make 
a lifelong friend too.

222
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,240
Sang Sik.

223
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,340
Let's

224
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
make this happen.

225
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,040
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,950
And?

227
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,530
I knew you wouldn't 
have saved my number.

228
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,460
Gosh.

229
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,900
No. eight, your number.

230
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,500
The number eight is 
a lucky number in China.

231
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,580
Let's talk on the phone
 like we used to.

232
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,260
Yeah.

233
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,100
Sales Team 3, Jang Geu Rae speaking.

234
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,500
Mr. Chun?

235
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,180
He's on the phone right now.

236
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,980
Yes.

237
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,430
Your number is?

238
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,140
I will contact you once 
we find the right one.

239
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,780
- I'll tell him to call you.
- Thanks.

240
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,700
Bye.

241
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,000
The products of Solar Team Korea 
meet Poshin's requirements,

242
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
so I got their number.

243
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,220
- Thanks.
- Sure.

244
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,100
Sales Team 3, Kim Dong Sik speaking.

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,280
Oh, thank you.

246
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,300
I'm sorry, I didn't know it 
was the CEO's phone number.

247
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,750
Oh, yes,

248
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,760
we'll try our best with the supply too.

249
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,260
Thank you.

250
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,900
China is proactive 
just like Mr. Oh said.

251
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,280
Yeah, since it's a breakthrough 
for Poshin too.

252
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,120
- Geu Rae.
- Yes.

253
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,940
Find the person in charge 
at the Trade Association

254
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,750
- and get detailed data on Poshin.
- Yes.

255
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,180
Have a good day, Geu Rae.

256
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,920
I see she keeps contacting you.

257
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,980
She tells me how she's doing at times.

258
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,940
I think she's interested in you.

259
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,600
No.

260
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,820
Be nice to her.

261
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,720
Maintain her pride for her.

262
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,180
Just reply to the text.

263
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,180
It's hard for me.

264
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,470
Ha? hard?

265
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,140
Wow.

266
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,010
It's just a nice simple reply,

267
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,240
don't over think it.

268
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,820
You know,

269
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,820
the day we drank together 
after your blind date?

270
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,980
Let's go for round two!

271
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
Where shall we go?
Round two.

272
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,590
Geu Rae!

273
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,860
Where shall we go?

274
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,000
Let's go next time.

275
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,090
Ok.

276
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,360
Bye.
Bye.

277
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,580
- Oh.
- See you next time.

278
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,660
See you

279
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,220
- if we see each other again.
- Yes.

280
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,580
But why are you following him?

281
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,480
I go in the same direction as him.

282
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,920
Bye!

283
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,760
Come on, you should go.

284
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,420
Where do you live?

285
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,740
Right over there.

286
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,700
Go now.

287
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,420
I'm almost home.

288
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,900
Ok, go home then,

289
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm on my way home too.

290
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,950
Where do you live?

291
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,750
You live here?

292
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,560
Yes, don?t send me 
any more useless texts.

293
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,740
Ok.

294
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,560
I'll send you useful texts from now on.

295
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,060
Bye-bye!

296
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,960
How'd you know my number?

297
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,520
I asked So Mi's mom.

298
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,440
It's pressuring.

299
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,870
Oh, it's pressuring for Captain Jang?

300
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,410
You don't know how lucky you are.

301
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,640
Mr. Kim.

302
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,110
Treat her well, she seemed nice.

303
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,900
It's not easy for 
a girl to be that aggressive.

304
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,920
[Jang Geu Rae: Contract employee]

305
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,730
It's not the time for 
me to be dating now.

306
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,830
What?

307
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,600
What?

308
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,760
It is, of course.

309
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,040
If you wait around, you'll become 
a crappy old bachelor like me.

310
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,540
Right, Mr. Chun?

311
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,080
Of course, there's 
a time for everything.

312
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,280
Then is it time for me to become crap?

313
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,150
[Jang Geu Rae: Contract employee]

314
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
Tell me no.

315
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,490
What did Poshin say?

316
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,090
They like it as expected.

317
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,460
They want as much supply as possible.

318
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,820
I'm looking into solar panel companies.

319
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,260
It'll take time to go over 
the US, Germany, and Korea.

320
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,360
Right.

321
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,680
But Mr. Oh?

322
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,720
What?

323
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,470
Poshin doesn?t have a middle manager.

324
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,710
What do you mean?

325
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,680
I called the number on the file,

326
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,260
and their CEO answered the phone.

327
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,550
Their CEO?

328
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,750
Yes.

329
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,160
Isn't it good if the CEO 
is on the same line?

330
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,560
He's taking care of it himself 
since it's important.

331
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,740
Just like Mr. Choi does it himself here.

332
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,930
Because it's our business.

333
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,880
If there are no middle 
managers like us,

334
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,380
who will take responsibility 
if there's an issue later?

335
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,070
What issue?

336
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,900
Mr. Oh.
What's wrong with you?

337
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,660
As soon as the solar panels are 
ready, approve and submit it.

338
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,760
I told you it's all set.

339
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,200
The approval is just a formality.

340
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,520
No olives, but onion?

341
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,220
A lot.

342
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,440
Ok.

343
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,960
I will be back.

344
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,430
- Where are you going?
- Out to buy sandwiches for snacks.

345
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,140
Are you ok?

346
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,930
Yeah.

347
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,040
Geu Rae.
- Yes.

348
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,440
Let's be prudent with work.

349
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,110
Excuse me?

350
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,160
Yes, sir.

351
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,860
Hello.

352
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,140
I'll take your order.

353
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,470
I'll have four sandwiches.

354
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,840
One without olives, lots of onion, 
and heat them all, please.

355
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,440
Yes.

356
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,460
Your team team the same taste as us.

357
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,570
Baek Ki.

358
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,480
New employees will have to come 
for us to leave these errands.

359
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,190
Your team seemed busy today.

360
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,120
We have urgent work to do.

361
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,590
- Mr. Choi?
- Yes.

362
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,160
Though it's weird why 
Mr. Oh accepted it.

363
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,120
Right, he doesn't like him.

364
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,040
But I think that decision was

365
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,260
possible since it'll help the team.

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,860
I was angry and I resented him,

367
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,700
but I realized I needed Suk Yool and

368
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,900
had to acknowledge him.

369
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,160
Since there's a difference 
you can't overcome

370
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,190
with just pride and stubbornness.

371
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,920
The leader has to think

372
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,460
of the team members.

373
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,080
For Mr. Chun, Mr. Kim, and?

374
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,460
Did Mr. Oh say anything else?

375
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,710
No.

376
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,980
I see.

377
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,560
Let's go.

378
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,280
- Baek Ki.
- Yes.

379
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,100
The schedule has changed, so 
you won't have to work late.

380
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,500
Is that right?

381
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,940
Mr. Kang.

382
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,080
I have a question.

383
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,370
What is it?

384
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,380
What changes when a team grows?

385
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,080
What?

386
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,700
So

387
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,720
when the team's position 
changes or size grows?

388
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,860
You'll need that much more manpower.

389
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,360
The dept. head can ask for more people.

390
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,540
Then

391
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,110
can you switch temps to full-timers?

392
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,060
That should be possible.

393
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,180
Why?

394
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,810
Nothing.

395
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,180
See you tomorrow.

396
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,440
Going home?

397
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,720
Yes, Mr. Oh.

398
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,500
I heard your team is working late.

399
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,700
Yeah, Geu Rae was complaining again?

400
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,360
No.

401
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,020
Mr. Oh.

402
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,240
Uh?

403
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,710
I heard you started a new business.

404
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,140
Yeah.

405
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,680
Uh?

406
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,180
I'm sure it won't happen,

407
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,280
but if, I mean if you need my help,

408
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,390
let me know.

409
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,630
Ok.

410
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,460
Hi, Dong Sik.

411
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,870
Yeah, it's on the desk.

412
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,580
It started coming off 
a few days ago.

413
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,940
Maybe it really costs a fortune.

414
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,300
But it's definitely not Mr. Oh's style.

415
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,340
Mr. Choi?

416
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,580
Yes.

417
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,550
Though it's weird why 
Mr. Oh accepted it.

418
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,840
But I think that decision was

419
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,580
possible since it'll help the team.

420
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,300
However, I still have this doubt

421
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,700
in my heart I can't get rid of.

422
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,220
Why?

423
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,010
Mr. Oh was insisting on 
it like never before.

424
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,140
Mr. Oh?

425
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,910
It seemed like he decided not
to make trouble about

426
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,980
Poshin not having 
a middle manager.

427
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,120
Yes.

428
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,580
Yes, the model?

429
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,660
We focused on securing 
solar panels instead.

430
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,300
Procuring the companies went smoothly

431
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,860
regarding the supply,
 costs, and quality too.

432
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,670
Poshin agreed that 
the conditions were great.

433
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,860
Is this right, Mr. Oh?

434
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,350
Mr. Oh sent a contract to Poshin.

435
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,640
Now, only approval is left.

436
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,620
Everything seemed to be going smoothly.

437
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:33,000
Then something unexpected happened.

438
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,550
Why, these?!

439
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,920
What's wrong?

440
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,520
Connect me to Poshin's CEO.

441
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,890
Why me?

442
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,400
Why Sales Team 3?

443
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm asking you because 
you're Oh Sang Sik.

444
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,980
Oh Sang Sik.

445
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,510
Would there be any other reason?

446
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,720
Was this why?

447
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,240
Mr. Choi?

448
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,560
We need to go through an agent?

449
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,500
And the commission is 2.5%?

450
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,590
The contract we sent 
didn?t say that, did it?

451
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,340
The CEO is saying it was 
agreed upon verbally.

452
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,440
What?

453
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,720
Verbally with whom?

454
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,070
Mr. Choi?

455
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,550
Uh?

456
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:03,120
So they'll take 2.5% out of 
our 3% margin?

457
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,260
Then our profit would
 decrease to 0.5%.

458
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,240
We decreased the 5% margin to

459
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,660
3% considering the connections.

460
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,170
But commission and 
an unnecessary agent?

461
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,620
The 3% was set reflecting the

462
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,700
connections in the original cost.

463
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,140
But the sudden agent and commission

464
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,320
from our margin could be a problem.

465
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,020
I have a different opinion.

466
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,780
It's not like the margin is zero,

467
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,220
and many of our businesses 
have 0.5% margin.

468
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,140
If we were to consider the potential 
growth of solar energy power plants,

469
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,320
I think this could be 
considered connections too.

470
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,140
I don't think there would be a problem.

471
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,770
Well,

472
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,800
I have to say something at least.

473
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,180
I don't know what's going on for sure,

474
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,280
but I could feel disharmony.

475
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,040
Just like trying to squeeze 
into unfitting clothes.

476
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,290
It felt unnatural.

477
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,030
I had so many questions.

478
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,820
What's going on?

479
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,880
Did you know about
 the tough conditions?

480
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,560
The adjusted costs were already 
reflected in the contract.

481
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,460
Now it says our margin is lower and

482
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,260
there will be an agent 
designated by Poshin.

483
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,180
This is just too much.

484
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,180
Mr. Oh.

485
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,860
Just approve and drop it.

486
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,230
Then

487
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,460
you knew all about it?

488
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,320
The profit may be small, but the

489
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,960
figures are fine within the company.

490
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,600
Alright.

491
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,580
Let's say we use an agent,

492
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,560
but don?t you think the 
2.5% commission is too much?

493
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,620
There's no problem!

494
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,900
Sir.

495
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,180
I don?t feel good about this business.

496
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,960
With the middle manager, this and all?

497
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
If something happens,

498
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,630
our team will die.

499
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,760
Come on, who's going to die?

500
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,020
You don't need to worry so much,

501
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,420
please have some faith.

502
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,840
You shouldn?t be on this case now.

503
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,820
Wrap it up and focus on the solar 
energy power plant business!

504
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,060
That's why you're doing this anyway!

505
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,420
Hold the China item for now.

506
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,610
Will that be ok?

507
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,460
Record all the calls

508
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,840
related to China for now.

509
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,180
What?

510
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,180
What?

511
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,390
- Geu Rae.
- Yes.

512
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,660
You had contacted the resident

513
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,300
employee in China before, right?

514
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
Yes, Mr. Suk.

515
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,860
Have you talked with 
him ever since then?

516
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,300
I thanked him before.

517
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,920
And what did he say?

518
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,920
Is he trustworthy?

519
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,310
I didn't think he was flaky.

520
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,780
Call him.

521
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,680
Ask him to find out what the agent
 Poshin designated is like.

522
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,590
And whether there were other cases

523
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,860
where an agent was suddenly introduced

524
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,860
among Poshin's items.

525
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,420
Tell him to call me directly.

526
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,760
Yes, sir.

527
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,360
It should be taken care of quietly,

528
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,560
ok?

529
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,160
Yes, sir.

530
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,640
We need to go through an agent?

531
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,380
And the commission is 2.5%?

532
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,350
The CEO is saying it was 
agreed upon verbally.

533
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,360
What?

534
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,060
Verbally with whom?

535
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,740
We decreased the 5% margin to

536
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,440
3% considering the connections.

537
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,640
But commission and 
an unnecessary agent?

538
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,080
The 3% was set reflecting the 
connections in the original cost.

539
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,340
But the sudden agent and commission

540
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,880
from our margin could be a problem.

541
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,620
Hold the China item for now.

542
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,560
Record all the calls 
related to China for now.

543
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,600
Something's weird.

544
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,900
But it's definitely not Mr. Oh's style.

545
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,440
Then why'd he accept this business?

546
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,200
And it's Mr. Choi?

547
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,660
Mr. Choi?

548
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,460
Yes.

549
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,900
Yes, sir, thank you.

550
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,460
- Sir.
- Yes.

551
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,460
About Chungsol?

552
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,060
Do you know they were 
sued for order delays?

553
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,760
Yeah, Mr. Sung gave me 
the report yesterday.

554
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,620
You knew about it?

555
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,760
But you still approved?

556
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,500
I told you a penalty condition 
for delays was added.

557
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,450
But a lawsuit is still not good,

558
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,640
so why should we work with them?

559
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,460
That's true.

560
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,060
But Mr. Sung guarantees it,

561
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,680
so I'm just trusting him.

562
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,660
What?

563
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,800
If a meticulous guy 
has such conviction,

564
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,900
there must be a reason for it.

565
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,240
Sir, I'm back.

566
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,540
Hi.

567
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,500
Sir.

568
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,280
I want to buy a car.

569
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,380
Pick one for me.

570
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,020
A car?

571
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,340
What, you're going to buy 
something this expensive?

572
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,660
I'll sign a contract with my bonus.

573
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,260
I haven't spent it yet.

574
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,480
You'll pay the rest in installments?

575
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,990
Did you have lunch?

576
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,820
Oh?

577
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,590
Hi.

578
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,160
Hi.

579
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,360
See you at the garden.

580
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,030
Baek Ki.

581
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,340
What is it?

582
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,640
What's going on?

583
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,980
So, uh?

584
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,150
I thought the shirt was so expensive.

585
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,650
What?

586
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,090
I already found out, so 
I had to do something.

587
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,080
It cost $50,000.

588
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,080
And I really bought it at an outlet,

589
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,580
so no worries at all.

590
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,750
Thank you.

591
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,860
Sure.

592
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,590
See if it's your size.

593
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,590
Shall I?

594
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,480
It fits perfectly.

595
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,550
Take care of the heels.

596
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,580
I normally don't wear heels.

597
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,260
What, you bought it for her?

598
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,930
Uh?

599
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,920
Good job?

600
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,120
I was going to buy you a pair.

601
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,120
Every time handsome Young Yi 
wears heels, I feel uneasy.

602
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Your right heel is shaky, right?

603
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,510
Why'd you observe my shoes?

604
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:51,200
I didn't observe them, your 
shoes caught my attention.

605
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,780
Your shoes did it, not me,

606
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,760
your shaky shoes.

607
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Ok, ok.

608
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,260
I'm glad you're here.

609
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,220
Let me hear your opinion.

610
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,420
Ok, let's say there's a company.

611
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,860
We buy it and sell it,
so we have the upper hand.

612
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,320
But we have to 
serve them, we have to.

613
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,630
We should be on the receiving end.

614
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:16,000
And they'd been sued for 
not meeting deadlines.

615
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,870
I'm talking about that company.

616
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,360
But they still go ahead 
with the contract

617
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,090
by adding articles to it.

618
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,020
What is this?

619
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,980
You don?t know?

620
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,120
I don?t know.

621
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,060
Bribery is going on.

622
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,990
Bribery.

623
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,760
I'm sure of it.

624
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,340
Bribery?

625
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,470
Mr. Seok has called, sir.

626
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,240
Hi, Mr. Seok.
This is Sang Sik.

627
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,040
Hello, Mr. Oh.

628
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,000
Work is tough, isn't it?

629
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
No, sir.

630
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,700
The agent you asked 
about is a corporation,

631
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,620
but there's not much 
info since they're new.

632
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,200
I looked into Poshin,

633
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,820
but they never used an agent before.

634
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,340
If necessary, they had 
one to begin with.

635
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,960
And the 2.5% commission is absurd.

636
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,480
You mean it's a lot?

637
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,880
Yes, it's usually 1%.

638
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,480
And our margin was 3%, right?

639
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,220
Right.

640
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,980
According to those in charge,

641
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,940
considering the quality 
solar panel conditions,

642
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,000
and the situation where
 we had helped them,

643
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,520
we could have highered our margin.

644
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,860
And it's an urgent item for Poshin too.

645
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,600
It's strange, right?

646
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,260
Ah, no.

647
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,720
They must have their reasons.

648
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,160
Thanks, I appreciate it.

649
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,940
New?

650
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,910
Our margin could've been higher than 5%

651
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,240
which is before reflecting connections?

652
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,780
So what do you think, Mr. Oh?

653
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,150
By any chance?

654
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,680
Sir, do you?

655
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,940
Do you think Mr. Choi 
is receiving a rebate?

656
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,780
Mr. Oh, you should drop this case.

657
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,620
I understand why you want to do it, but

658
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,040
the team could end up being eliminated.

659
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,410
Mr. Oh.

660
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,750
Why are you hesitating?

661
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,920
You have another plan?

662
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,430
Geu Rae is on the line.

663
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,600
What?

664
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,600
What?

665
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,200
Yeah.

666
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,380
How are things going?

667
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,640
What?

668
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,780
The new business?

669
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,740
What are you so worried about?

670
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,020
Oh, nothing.

671
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,460
Geu Rae.

672
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,040
I don't know what's on your mind,

673
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,440
but just do it.

674
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,200
Don't look back,

675
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,960
don?t ask any questions and?

676
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,600
Trust Mr. Oh

677
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,450
and do it.

678
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,920
Why should I?

679
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,860
You said so.

680
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,220
That this business is meant for 
Mr. Oh to build up the team.

681
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,880
If that happens and he becomes 
dept. head, you could

682
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,400
have the chance to 
become a full-timer.

683
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,520
Geu Rae.

684
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,140
I don't know what you're 
concerned about,

685
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,360
but I wish

686
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,850
you'd do it.

687
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,700
Switch to a full-timer?

688
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,040
Yes, this is a good opportunity.

689
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,880
That's why.

690
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,990
If I insist, the team 
could get in trouble,

691
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,390
but if I quit,

692
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,530
Geu Rae could be losing
 his last chance.

693
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,670
Mr. Oh.

694
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,260
There's no proof Mr. Choi 
is receiving a rebate.

695
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,580
Please give it some more thought.

696
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,040
Yes, Mr. Oh.

697
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,000
If Geu Rae's on the line,

698
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,020
I want to do the best I can too.

699
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,700
If that happens and he becomes 
dept. head, you could

700
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,500
have the chance to become a full-timer.

701
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,380
Hi.

702
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,900
Where are you now?

703
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,240
I'm on the way back.

704
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,080
I have something to tell you.

705
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,390
Go ahead.

706
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,060
Yes, sir.

707
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,220
Yes.

708
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,280
I'll get some air, I need 
to think things through too.

709
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,120
Yes, sir.

710
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,980
Do you think Mr. Choi 
is receiving a rebate?

711
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,450
Geu Rae is on the line.

712
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:07,150
If I insist, the team 
could get in trouble,

713
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,490
but if I quit,

714
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:16,220
Geu Rae could be
 losing his last chance.

715
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,040
What is it, why?

716
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,780
Is it because of me?

717
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,280
What?

718
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,920
All the strange circumstances 
with this case?

719
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,300
Things you wouldn't have 
ignored normally?

720
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,360
This time you're overlooking them.

721
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,600
Is it because of me?

722
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,500
You're so arrogant!

723
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,230
Please stop if it's for me.

724
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,980
I don?t understand what you mean!

725
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,920
And what do you mean, 
strange circumstances?

726
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,880
Stop the nonsense and go work.

727
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,100
I couldn't understand why an agent 
appeared out of nowhere on the contract,

728
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,540
and a commission was requested too.

729
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,600
I call the shots.

730
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,140
I'm saying this out of concern that

731
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,890
I might've affected your judgment.

732
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,160
Arrogant kid.

733
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,130
- Who are you to say my judgment?
- You're trying to save me.

734
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:35,980
You're

735
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,540
trying to make me a full-timer.

736
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,620
Isn't that why

737
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,660
you're working with people 
who you normally never would?

738
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,620
I don't want to put the team in danger.

739
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,240
Please.

740
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,430
Don't do it.

741
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,380
I don't know what you're thinking!

742
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,300
But if you want to criticize 
Mr. Choi, save your breath.

743
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,700
Yes, we don't get along.

744
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,940
But we can keep our 
personal lives and work separate!

745
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,340
He and I both!

746
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,270
You think work is a joke?

747
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,480
I think Mr. Choi has ulterior motives.

748
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,380
I think he's using us.

749
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,780
Don't be absurd!

750
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,850
He's produced much greater 
results than you!

751
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,760
Also, his contribution to this 
company is a lot greater than me!

752
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,720
He's worked for the company 
much longer than you or me!

753
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,040
He might hate me, but he wouldn't

754
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,660
hurt his team or company!

755
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,910
Don't worry, I'll make this work.

756
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,410
No one will have trouble.

757
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,880
I'll find a solution to 
get the best results.

758
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,880
Mr. Oh.

759
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,080
Right, it's a chance to save you.

760
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,350
So I'll do what I can, why you ask?

761
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:03,840
If I don't do it now,

762
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,320
even if the chance comes next time,

763
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,330
I don't know if I'll feel the same way.

764
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,370
I told him he won't make it.

765
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,600
It's tougher than Eun Ji's times.

766
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,370
What's the use of high hopes

767
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,340
and irresponsible consolation?

768
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,440
Many people are desperate for

769
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,080
those words or consolation.

770
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,020
Still, he won't make it.

771
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,860
Go down.

772
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,040
Your job is to work.

773
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,960
Don?t do anything besides that.

774
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,230
Don't have suspicions about anything.

775
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,020
I can tell that you love your shoes.

776
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,260
Don't be so overt.

777
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,180
You're embarrassing me.

778
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,280
Well, whenever I get new shoes,

779
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,190
I become more careful 
to walk ladylike.

780
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,420
Any problems with R&D?

781
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,460
You can ask Sang Hyun 
for help if necessary.

782
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,440
What?

783
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,060
He said he has a close 
friend who could help.

784
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:53,570
Young Yi.

785
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,440
Who is this?

786
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,650
I'm Young Yi's dad.

787
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,740
Oh, yes.

788
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,880
Hello.

789
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,100
I'm Jang Baek Ki and we 
started work together.

790
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,660
Go ahead.

791
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,720
See you tomorrow.

792
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,000
Ok.

793
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,600
I called Mr. Shin.

794
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,810
Let's go for some rice and soup.

795
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,960
I want to eat rice for a change.

796
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,580
Don't be like that.

797
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,020
You're choking me.

798
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,820
Your mom has a cold.

799
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,320
Her bones hurt too with 
arthritis or something.

800
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,340
You should see her.

801
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,140
You can hate me,

802
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,460
but don?t hate your mom.

803
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,720
How'd you know where I worked?

804
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,240
I called Mr. Shin.

805
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,680
I visited him recently.

806
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,220
Why'd you visit him?

807
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,880
Just to say hi, ok?

808
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,320
He said he met you there 
and you're doing well?

809
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,040
He was complimenting you.

810
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,340
I went to thank him.

811
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,520
I was late, but I owed him that.

812
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,380
I kept myself from going because 
you were dead against it.

813
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,380
Think about my position.

814
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,010
He lent me so much money, so I'd be

815
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,200
a guy with no manners or conscience.

816
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,460
So,

817
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,460
what brings you here?

818
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,060
I heard you got a new bank account.

819
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,760
You paid it all off?

820
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,200
I was going to help somehow,

821
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,040
but I'm sorry I couldn?t.

822
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,810
Don?t waste your money,

823
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:49,280
and save as much as you can.

824
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,980
That way, you can use 
it in an emergency.

825
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,060
Oh, yeah.

826
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,220
Uh?

827
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,540
Wire me $500 if you can.

828
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,960
What should I do?

829
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,070
What should I do to 
escape from you, Dad?

830
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,910
Wire it.

831
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,400
Shall we have a drink?

832
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,020
This is my dad.

833
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,300
Dot dot dot.

834
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,910
He really makes me speechless.

835
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,250
My dad was a soldier.

836
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,120
He was upset that I wasn?t born a boy.

837
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:40,770
He always said, "You 
should've been born a boy."

838
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:47,160
He always told my mom, "Don't put 
too much effort into the girl."

839
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,720
They never helped with tuition.

840
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,520
So here, it's "They went to school?"

841
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,930
I started working part-time 
from high school.

842
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:04,500
Here's your pizza.

843
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:10,040
My dad quit and started 
this and that business.

844
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,940
He got swindled and went bankrupt.

845
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,780
Then he took my paycheck too.

846
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,180
I went to college on a full scholarship.

847
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,520
I worked part-time and 
gave him money again.

848
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,920
But I couldn?t get free.

849
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:37,830
I got a job before I graduated.

850
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,700
Yes.

851
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,270
At Samjung.

852
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:02,240
You know Shin Woo Hyun?

853
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,240
Yes.

854
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,920
He was my boss.

855
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,600
But why?

856
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,980
How much is your yearly pay?

857
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,580
How are the benefits?

858
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,620
Since it's a big company, you 
can get a big loan, right?

859
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,020
I'm going to open a store.

860
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,780
I loaned money from

861
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:37,390
the bank to help him out.

862
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,160
But it didn't stop.

863
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,980
There was no way.

864
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,380
Then my dad

865
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,540
went to Mr. Shin

866
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,200
without telling me.

867
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:58,860
Mr. Shin

868
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,980
taught me how to live 
 as Ahn Young Yi.

869
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,750
Not a girl who's sorry 
for not being a boy.

870
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,080
Good job.

871
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:19,300
China or Arabian buyers don?t think 
the person in charge would be female.

872
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,180
Whenever you're in a meeting with 
guys, always sit in the middle.

873
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,300
Yes.

874
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:28,420
The fulfillment of labor and

875
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:31,910
myself,

876
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,040
my future?

877
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,050
I started to value them.

878
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:49,500
Until I learned my dad had 
borrowed money from him.

879
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,960
Why'd you do that?

880
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,290
Why didn't you ask me?

881
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,580
You thought I'd appreciate it?

882
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,300
You thought I'd thank you forever?

883
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,640
I didn't want such 
circumstances to shake you.

884
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,640
Shake me?

885
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,920
Who?

886
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,400
That's what he said?

887
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,900
That I'd have trouble 
without the money?

888
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,560
- Young Yi.
- Drop it!

889
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,690
You're a hypocrite.

890
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:24,200
You did it knowing how pitiful I'd feel.

891
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,120
I know you're enjoying this situation.

892
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,430
Young Yi!

893
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,370
I just yelled at him like I was crazy.

894
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,960
And

895
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,100
it was over.

896
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,240
After quitting Samjung,

897
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,850
I stayed home for about six months.

898
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,180
Like I was dead.

899
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,800
I wanted to die.

900
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,190
Then one day,

901
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:06,200
when I was watching 
a documentary on TV,

902
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:12,400
I realized I shouldn't die like that.

903
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,960
What documentary was it?

904
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,240
I don?t know.

905
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,540
It was about company workers

906
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,740
arguing over who'd pay for lunch.

907
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,650
They looked pathetic.

908
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,040
I thought I should be among them.

909
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,460
I wanted to

910
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,440
live my life.

911
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,700
Did you like

912
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,550
Mr. Shin?

913
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,800
Young Yi.

914
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,540
Yes.

915
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,450
Shall we go see 
a late-night horror movie?

916
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,450
What?

917
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,420
You can't watch horror.

918
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,300
Uh?

919
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:43,840
I suddenly felt

920
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,940
I could watch one.

921
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,240
Then let's have some red

922
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,140
blood soup afterwards.

923
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:59,260
That's too much for me as of yet.

924
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,000
Let's go.

925
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,820
Sure.

926
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:24,500
Don't worry, I'll make this work.

927
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,770
No one will have trouble.

928
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:34,970
I'll find a solution to 
get the best results.

929
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,400
Right, it's a chance to save you.

930
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,800
So I'll do what I can, why you ask?

931
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,100
If I don't do it now,

932
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,300
even if the chance comes next time,

933
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,920
I don't know if I'll feel 
the same way.

934
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:29,720
Please update the subsidiary 
material shipment status.

935
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,820
Yes.

936
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,040
Last time, the factory manager 
complained due to the delay.

937
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,720
The fabric is on time 
and under process,

938
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,860
so don?t worry.

939
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,100
Yes, as long as the materials are

940
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,260
on time and the sooner, the better.

941
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,940
Thank you.

942
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,180
Bye.

943
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,440
Bribery.

944
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,800
I'm sure that's involved.

945
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,790
I'm sure of it.

946
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:11,900
Gosh, what is he thinking about now?

947
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,740
Did he get yelled at gain?

948
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,310
I don?t think it's right time for him.

949
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,840
Hi.

950
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,840
What's going on with Geu Rae?

951
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,660
I don't know.
Is something wrong?

952
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,220
How come you don't care?

953
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,700
Is he an outcast?

954
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,000
- Is something wrong?
- Baek Ki.

955
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,360
Something must've happened to Geu Rae,
but you don?t know, right?

956
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,640
What?

957
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,080
I don't.

958
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,910
What could he be so worried about?

959
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,520
Ok, us newbies should get 
together for lunch later.

960
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,860
Did you hear anything about him?

961
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,540
No.

962
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,320
I think Mr. Choi has ulterior motives.

963
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,430
I think he's using us.

964
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,130
Don't be absurd!

965
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:23,200
He's produced much greater 
results than you!

966
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,300
And his contribution to this 
company is a lot greater than me!

967
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,110
He's worked for the company 
much longer than you or me!

968
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,920
He might hate me, but he wouldn't

969
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,680
hurt his team or company!

970
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,110
Geu Rae.

971
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,780
Yes.

972
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,520
What are you thinking about now?

973
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,840
Nothing.

974
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,180
Yeah right.

975
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,780
I told you not to be a philosopher.

976
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,390
- Mr. Oh?
- We finished our talk last night.

977
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,340
Mr. Oh.

978
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:21,930
Do your work.

979
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,740
Mr. Oh.

980
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:42,700
If you or the company has 
any trouble because of me,

981
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,050
it's all useless.

982
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,940
Your intentions

983
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,090
to save me are more than enough, sir.

984
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,660
Hi, Mom.

985
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:47,260
You must be busy, I'll make it quick.

986
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,400
Ok.

987
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,040
Which dry cleaners is your tie at?

988
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,480
I need to get it for you.

989
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,700
Kim's or Lee's?

990
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,560
Lee's closed down.

991
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,560
Oh, right.

992
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,560
Ok, bye.

993
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,960
Mom.

994
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,340
Yeah.

995
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,920
I'm busy, hurry up.

996
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,030
I'm busy, hurry up.

997
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,460
Mom.

998
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,500
Do you want to do public services?

999
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,740
What?

1000
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:23,940
When I took my intern test,

1001
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:29,840
you complained that you 
couldn't go if I passed.

1002
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,250
Of course, I want to!

1003
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,140
Bye.

1004
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:42,040
Come home early.

1005
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,160
Ok.

1006
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:41,420
Hello?

1007
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,900
Geu Rae.

1008
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,320
Mr. Seok.

1009
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,160
Hello.

1010
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,440
Hi, where's Mr. Oh?

1011
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,400
He's away at the moment.

1012
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,420
You can tell me if it's urgent.

1013
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,420
I'll give him this recording.

1014
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,460
I contacted Poshin, and rumor has it,

1015
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,760
if this solar panel order works out,

1016
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,000
the power plant business 
will practically take off.

1017
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,420
Then there's no reason
 for One International

1018
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,080
to take these conditions, right?

1019
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:16,120
Don't we have a supporting role so 
that Poshin can obtain the business,

1020
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,980
by securing supplies?

1021
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,190
Right.

1022
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:22,700
So I told Mr. Oh there won't be

1023
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:26,680
any problem with a much bigger margin.

1024
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,260
But Poshin is requesting the margin

1025
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:32,100
we deserve as the agent's commission?

1026
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,380
Under the name of connections.

1027
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:36,770
Right.

1028
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,860
Mr. Seok.

1029
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,860
I have a question.

1030
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:48,820
Then aren't the roles

1031
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,200
reversed right now?

1032
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,020
I don't know how Mr. Choi
 made that judgment,

1033
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,560
but our company actually 
has the upper hand, right?

1034
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,300
Mr. Seok.

1035
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,680
Geu Rae!

1036
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:48,210
[Misaeng]

1037
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,820
See it to the end even if 
you don't think it'll work.

1038
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,820
We have no choice but to run now.

1039
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:54,850
Did he just grab it?

1040
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,360
I'm disappointed in Mr. Oh.

1041
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,350
Don't say that when
 you don't even know!

1042
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:59,620
We're from the headquarters.

1043
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:02,390
We heard your team has a recording.

1044
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,540
What is this?

1045
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,030
In life, there are many things 
you start knowing how it'll end.
