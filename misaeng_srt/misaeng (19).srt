Geu Rae.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,720
What were you thinking?

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,990
What did I…

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,500
Connect me to Mr. Seok.

[Episode 19]

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,140
Our youngest one made a mistake.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,480
No way.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,200
We don’t think so at all.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,860
I told you last time it's

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,100
to make things clear.

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,960
Don't worry.

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,290
Recording?

22
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,520
Come on, I already deleted it.

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,160
Yeah.

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,440
I'll treat you to soju 
when you come to Korea.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,210
Have a good day.

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,090
Mr. Chun and Mr. Kim.

27
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,790
Leave the room.

28
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,100
You couldn't believe me till the end?

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,620
- Mr. Oh.
- I told you I'd take care of it.

30
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,750
Geu Rae.

31
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,620
Listen carefully.

32
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,780
What you did today could

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
actually put the team in danger.

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,280
Why did Geu Rae do 
something so foolish?

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,970
Even if he's not familiar…

36
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,200
Mr. Seok must be so nervous now.

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,100
It's like saying Mr. Choi is corrupt,

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,440
and Mr. Seok is in on it too.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,850
Mr. Seok is not in the position to 
take responsibility for his words,

40
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,720
so there's no telling what he'll do 
if he gets negative vibes about this.

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,060
And there's no proof for

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,790
your distrust in Mr. Choi.

43
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,160
If the case gets out of hand,

44
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,470
and Mr. Choi is proven to
 have no fault at all,

45
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,500
our team and you will have to

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,520
take responsibility since 
you started it.

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,680
Geu Rae found out?

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,350
Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,350
You're trying to save me.

50
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,400
You're

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,650
trying to make me a full-timer.

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,280
He thinks he's affecting 
Mr. Oh's judgment.

53
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,260
So I think he wanted to 
confirm his suspicions.

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,760
He must've wanted to save the team.

55
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,020
Though it was immature.

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,880
I'm sure he couldn't take it 
thinking it was his fault.

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,600
That fool.

58
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,380
He should've discussed it with me.

59
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,160
Uh, Mr. Oh.

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
I've put Mr. Seok at ease,

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,910
so things won't get out of hand.

62
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,910
In order to make sure of that,

63
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,950
we need to show him
 we're working again.

64
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,480
You're right.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,020
We have no choice but 
to keep dashing now.

66
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,960
Check each company's contract,

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,260
make sure it's checked 
thoroughly by others too.

68
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,900
Double check Poshin's contract,

69
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,020
and make sure the details
 are favorable to us.

70
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,200
What about the agent?

71
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,900
I'll go talk to Mr. Choi.

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,400
Yeah, the agent was confirmed.

73
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
The details didn't exist 
in the previous files.

74
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,330
Didn't I tell you the 
circumstances have changed?

75
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,360
I mean the solar energy 
power plant business.

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
I thought the connections 
would take care of that.

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,360
No, that's the norm.

78
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,520
We need something additional.

79
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,240
Categories were just divided 
with potential issues in mind.

80
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,260
Just think of it all as connections.

81
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,340
Then, our profit rate from the

82
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,530
solar panel business would be 0.5%.

83
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,300
That means it's nearly zero

84
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,140
considering the business' 
characteristics.

85
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,240
Mr. Oh, it's despite that.

86
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,340
Mr. Choi.

87
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,480
I've worked here for 28 years.

88
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,780
I grew with this company.

89
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,460
I always showed them results,

90
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,360
I mean always.

91
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,640
When the economy was bad, and 
other companies were in trouble,

92
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,160
you know how we were?

93
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,720
We found a market using 
all my lines in China.

94
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,200
I saved the company each time.

95
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,360
I helped it grow, 
and that's how it grew.

96
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,960
This was all possible because I had

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,400
made family-like business 
partners there.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
It's no different this time.

99
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,720
No matter how much 
we pay for the connections,

100
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,290
it's for the company.

101
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,410
I respect whatever way you 
had helped the company grow.

102
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,880
But please don't use that method

103
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,020
for this case.

104
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,300
We'll proceed with the original 
contract we had sent.

105
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,580
Mr. Oh.

106
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,360
That's what the company approved

107
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,020
and that I can accept.

108
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,680
So please help this 
business go smoothly.

109
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,100
Please delete the details 
on the agent, sir.

110
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,720
Or we won't be able to 
work on this business.

111
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,040
If that's deleted,

112
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,420
we'll definitely get 
the second business too.

113
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,940
I'll make sure there's no problem

114
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,200
with you becoming vice president.

115
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,140
Mr. Oh.

116
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,900
Proceed as the original 
without the agent.

117
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,500
Will that be ok?

118
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Yeah.

119
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,960
Geu Rae, did you get replies for the 
emails you sent to domestic companies?

120
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,270
Yes, they're on your desk.

121
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,800
Did you threaten Mr. Choi?

122
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,940
Will that be ok?

123
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,550
He'll accept it.

124
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,020
He has to become vice president.

125
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,440
Your team is good.

126
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,240
Securing that much supply within 
a short period of time…

127
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,860
Do you work well with them?

128
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,610
Yes.

129
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,160
Why are you so nervous?

130
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,750
You still get nervous around me?

131
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,540
Oh, what do you think?

132
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,380
Do you think it'll be impressive enough

133
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,040
even without the agent details?

134
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,500
Enough for Poshin to want to 
give us the next business?

135
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,880
I,

136
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,370
my opinion is

137
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,340
I don't know.

138
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,640
But

139
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,740
but Mr. Oh will make it succeed.

140
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,240
So please trust him.

141
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,130
He didn't tell you about Geu Rae?

142
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,730
Mr. Park, I asked Chungsol so many 
times for the parts statement.

143
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,320
It was delayed, then replaced to

144
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,500
cheap items, not once but many times.

145
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,470
I said no.

146
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,580
You don't care?

147
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,940
Mr. Lee said it was ok…?

148
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,560
No, please call me after 
you find a solution.

149
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,150
Yes.

150
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,820
How much will the frigging Mr. Sung get?

151
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,030
Chungsol has to replace parts again.

152
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,260
Yeah?

153
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,960
They must've done so since they 
couldn't get the original ones.

154
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,200
They must've done so?

155
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,000
You know it's not that 
simple, the quality will…

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,920
Will be fine, just be quiet.

157
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,400
They can't change it, 
I'll have them come now.

158
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Hey.

159
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,140
Have them come?

160
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,950
If you need them, you go.

161
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,340
Don't you know what 
the times are like?

162
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,860
Hello?

163
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,130
Yes, sir, I heard about it.

164
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,240
No, just proceed with it, 
I'll get permission for it.

165
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,600
Meeting the deadline is more important.

166
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,600
No, you don't need to come.

167
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,580
I'll call you back in a minute.

168
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,840
Jerk, you made the factory
 come to a stall.

169
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,280
Till when should I clean 
up after your mess?

170
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,830
No, sir.

171
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,880
Come on, think of our relationship.

172
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,840
Geez.

173
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,800
Yes.

174
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,160
I received it.

175
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,680
I know I've received a lot.

176
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,440
So, I'll pay you back,

177
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,950
I'll keep paying you back!

178
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,660
Geez!

179
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,660
Ok.

180
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,420
I'll pay back all of it.

181
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,940
See you tomorrow evening.

182
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,100
I'll talk to you in person, bye.

183
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,120
Dang.

184
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,760
What is this?

185
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,320
I was hoping my suspicions 
weren't true.

186
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,040
Oh, my gosh.

187
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,730
He's really doing something fishy?

188
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,500
Geez.

189
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,740
Hi, have you seen Geu Rae?

190
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,660
We couldn't have lunch together.

191
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,380
He won't answer your calls either?

192
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,160
No, the office is vacant and 
his team must be super busy.

193
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,880
Yeah.

194
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,960
Maybe it's because of that.

195
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,100
What?

196
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,370
There's a China-related business.

197
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,340
Mr. Ma and Resource Team 3 
were on it originally,

198
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,780
but Mr. Choi seemed to have 
given it over to Sales Team 3.

199
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,200
The scale is quite large.

200
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,120
About $0.5 billion?

201
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,440
$0.5 billion?

202
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,900
Yes.

203
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,540
If it's a success, the 
team could expand.

204
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,720
I'm a bit disappointed in Mr. Oh.

205
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,140
I thought he was against 
all of Mr. Choi's intention.

206
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,670
I felt the same way.

207
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,400
But work is work.

208
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,440
But I'm still disappointed.

209
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,260
Maybe he just grabbed 
the rope given to him.

210
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,660
What are you talking about?

211
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,390
Oh, Geu Rae.

212
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,840
Don't say whatever you want when you 
don't know what you're talking about!

213
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,290
Don't…!

214
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,820
Don't say whatever you want.

215
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,240
Geu Rae, we…

216
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,900
Geu Rae…

217
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,160
<i>Right, it's a chance to save you.</i>

218
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,490
<i>So I'll do what I can, why you ask?</i>

219
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,620
If I don't do it now,

220
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,790
even if the chance comes next time,

221
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,460
I don't know if I'll feel the same way.

222
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,880
<i>I think Mr. Oh accepted
 Mr. Choi's case</i>

223
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,720
<i>since he can make 
Geu Rae a full-timer.</i>

224
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,320
Make him a full-timer?

225
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,200
Since he can ask for more people

226
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,040
if he becomes head of the dept.

227
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,460
Then how can that succeed?

228
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,620
I mean, what can I do here?

229
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,790
What can we do?

230
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,520
Probably nothing.

231
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,200
No, I'm sure there's

232
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,340
something like Ms. Sun's…

233
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,680
No.

234
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,870
No, Suk Yool.

235
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,040
This is different from that time.

236
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,460
I asked you to come play 
<i>Go</i>, why won't you come?

237
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,230
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,140
Ok, come when you have time.

239
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,200
See you.

240
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,560
Hello?

241
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,100
Sales Team 3, Oh Sang Sik speaking.

242
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,620
<i>This is Mr. Choi's secretary speaking.</i>

243
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,720
Yes.

244
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,960
<i>He'd like to have dinner with you.</i>

245
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,420
Come on in.

246
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,650
I invited him.

247
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,280
I thought I was being too careless

248
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,320
after giving responsibilities.

249
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,130
He's done a lot for the company,

250
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,020
and I felt I ought to treat him

251
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,910
since I had chosen him
 as you said.

252
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,160
I don't know if he's 
serious for his age,

253
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,040
or shy.

254
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,740
I asked him to come for a game 
of <i>Go</i>, but he won't come.

255
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,420
Oh, you heard of this, 
right, Geu Rae?

256
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
"A good move for me could be

257
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,640
good for the opponent too."

258
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,600
Let's eat, the bass looks good.

259
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,210
Geu Rae has a lot of work today, sir.

260
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Is that so?

261
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,690
Yes.

262
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,860
I guess we have no choice.

263
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,900
Let's eat together next time.

264
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,260
Yes, sir.

265
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,050
Come to think of it,

266
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,920
isn't there a reason you 
need this business too?

267
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,900
I had you come since you 
seemed to have forgotten it.

268
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,260
Some people only think of winning

269
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,740
and having the opponent lose.

270
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,380
They're bound to lose in the long run.

271
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,220
I like to lose and 
have the opponent win.

272
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,800
I don't like either winning or losing.

273
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,720
Let's have a win-win situation.

274
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,300
You win and I win.

275
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,180
<i>Isn't there a reason you 
need this business too?</i>

276
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,620
<i>Let's have a win-win situation.</i>

277
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,360
<i>You win and I win.</i>

278
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,760
<i>I'll do it.</i>

279
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,040
However you'd like.

280
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,760
But I can't just trust you

281
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,440
like I did with Lee Eun Ji.

282
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,950
So?

283
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,480
I'll make this case work 
no matter what.

284
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,980
So,

285
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,860
please give me a definite answer.

286
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,560
Promise me that you won't ask 
our team to be responsible

287
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,560
for anything related to connections.

288
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,940
Promise?

289
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,180
Should I sign a contract?

290
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,300
It'll be an arbitrary decision.

291
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,700
I'll take responsibility 
if there are any issues.

292
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,660
Is that definite enough 
of an answer for you?

293
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,900
That's not enough?

294
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
I don't know what Mr. Choi's thinking.

295
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,670
I was sure he chose our team 
as the bullets and the shield.

296
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,740
But he answers me so easily.

297
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,410
Circumstances always change.

298
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,280
You made progress up until the 
point of signing the deal.

299
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,420
You've been a much bigger 
success than Mr. Choi expected.

300
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,720
Your team is bullets for him now.

301
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,760
Effective and fast bullets at that.

302
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,560
Plus, he's purpose-driven.

303
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,960
You should just focus 
on your purpose too.

304
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,210
Yes, Mr. Lee.

305
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,240
Yes.

306
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,280
I'll see you there at 6:30.

307
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,950
Don't give this month's accounts 
over to General Affairs yet.

308
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,180
Why not?

309
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,160
Must I sacrifice myself when 
I'm cleaning up for your mess?

310
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,280
Yes, sir.

311
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,680
What about headquarters' work 
environment improvement survey?

312
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,230
Just check and submit it.

313
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,700
Since the spent expenses for the 
final report should be perfect,

314
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,200
I revised this to this.

315
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,840
Ok, looks good.

316
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,150
Hello.

317
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,440
You should wrap up work in the office.

318
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,140
Don't give kids stress.

319
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,550
You should quit smoking yourself.

320
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,740
Hasn't Young Yi said 
you smell gross?

321
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,360
No, she hasn't.

322
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,480
Headquarters will do environment 
improvement survey, right?

323
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,860
Oh, yes.

324
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,140
It's such a hassle.

325
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,770
Nothing changes even if you tell them.

326
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,880
Sir, you said you needed 
to go to Finance.

327
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,760
Hello.

328
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,620
We're from headquarters for a work 
environment improvement survey.

329
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,560
I'm Kang Min Gyung and this is

330
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,000
our new employee Lee Yun Suh.

331
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,060
Hello.

332
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,480
You can give out the surveys now.

333
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,710
You can give it back to 
me after you fill it out.

334
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,550
They must've fallen for her.

335
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,830
No way.

336
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,790
Yun Suh!

337
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,920
Don't put your pen in 
your mouth, that's rude.

338
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,300
I'm sorry.

339
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,580
- I'm sorry.
- Give it to us, we'll do it.

340
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,360
Don't give the whole thing to him!

341
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,650
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.

342
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,520
I'm sorry.

343
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,900
I'm sorry.

344
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,280
I'm sorry.

345
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,090
They say the enemy of 
women are women.

346
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,520
She's being mean because 
she's younger and prettier.

347
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,840
What's wrong with putting 
the pen in her mouth?

348
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,200
Personal habits in public 
settings aren't good.

349
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,030
She should've been told off.

350
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,300
She was just cute.

351
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,700
Hello.

352
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,960
Cute?

353
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,240
She lacked the basics.

354
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,280
Her boss lacked the basics.

355
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,540
She embarrassed her.

356
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,940
Embarrassed?

357
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,750
I'd like to ask Young Yi 
how she's felt till now.

358
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,560
Mr. Kang.

359
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,760
I always thought your 
taste in girls was unique.

360
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,790
What do you mean?

361
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,940
You like stick-skinny girls like her.

362
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,520
Stiff girls that are cold-blooded.

363
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,120
Watch what you say.

364
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,640
I like girls who are proper.

365
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,220
You like giggly pushovers, 
don't you?

366
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,580
Come on, get your words straight.

367
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,180
I like warm girls who

368
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,750
can make others smile.

369
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,440
I think you like thin or curvy girls.

370
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,130
Anyway the new employee is my type.

371
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,300
She's cute.

372
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,540
Who do you like better, Baek Ki?

373
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,110
What?

374
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,390
I think Ms. Kang would be fussy.

375
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,630
See?

376
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,390
Your taste is weird.

377
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,730
Yeah.

378
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,340
You're loyal, man.

379
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,760
Uh, Mr. Kang.

380
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,360
I'm disappointed in your
 taste in women.

381
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,460
What's going on?

382
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,760
You've been working here for over 
a year, and you still don't get it?

383
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,880
The boss' taste is the Bible.

384
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,360
To corny jokes, you go…
Laugh hysterically.

385
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,660
To his taste in food…
"That's yummy."

386
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,140
When he wants to smoke, 
"I'll go with you."

387
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,800
You need to adjust to his taste in 
music, art, politics, and society.

388
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,840
But you know what's way 
on top of all that?

389
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,600
Taste in girls.
Taste in girls.

390
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,400
You should always say his is the best.

391
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,240
Only if you like that boss.

392
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,620
Hello.

393
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,960
Hello.

394
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,290
Mr. Kang still doesn't 
acknowledge it, right?

395
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,680
What?

396
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,640
Oh, yeah.

397
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,730
His taste in girls is weird.

398
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,630
- It's ready.
- Thanks.

399
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,180
Young Yi, you saw them, who 
was prettier among the two?

400
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,440
I thought the new employee 
was much more charming.

401
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
Right?

402
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,940
See, girls have accurate judgment.

403
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,560
So I want to learn to act cute

404
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,660
since I lack that.

405
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,720
She's the best learner.

406
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,320
Clearly different from 
book-smart Baek Ki.

407
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
Different in every way.

408
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,520
Oh, I better go.

409
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,600
"Learn to act cute…"

410
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,320
We should be able to say that 
as company employees.

411
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,520
Where did Suk Yool go?

412
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,380
I'm glad I renewed my driver's license.

413
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,420
Meeting at the waterfront 
of the Han River…

414
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,850
Someone's watched a lot of movies.

415
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Nice.

416
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,540
Gosh, it's Mr. Lee, alright.

417
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,940
Mr. Sung is so nervous.

418
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,500
Now give him money, money,

419
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,480
money for bribery.

420
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,200
What's that?

421
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,320
Suk Yool.

422
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,550
What?

423
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,520
Hi, Geu Rae.

424
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,590
- Getting off work?
- Yes.

425
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,790
Ok.

426
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,400
Is something wrong?

427
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,800
No.

428
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,740
Ok, see you tomorrow.

429
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,100
Geu Rae.

430
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,500
Is work going smoothly?

431
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,630
What?

432
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,940
It should go smoothly, it has to.

433
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,820
See you tomorrow.

434
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,740
<i>Right, life throws tough quizzes</i>

435
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,420
<i>at you to make you helpless.</i>

436
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,520
<i>But it leaves you hints 
in funny places at times.</i>

437
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,040
<i>But of course, there's no guarantee</i>

438
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,830
<i>the answers you get are correct.</i>

439
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,020
Hi.

440
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,880
Don't get up.

441
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,380
Mr. Choi.

442
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,610
Sit down.

443
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,300
You're working hard.

444
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,050
Let me know if you need anything.

445
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,220
Yeah, Mr. Kim will be 
losing some weight.

446
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,760
Have a good day.

447
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,730
<i>After that day between 
Mr. Oh and Mr. Choi,</i>

448
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,520
<i>our team seemed like they wanted 
to succeed no matter what.</i>

449
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,440
<i>We only focused on work,</i>

450
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,320
<i>we didn't think about anything else.</i>

451
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,680
- Mr. Oh.
- Yes.

452
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,660
About this, what will you 
do for after measures?

453
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,860
The sample test results…

454
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,490
<i>Then one day…</i>

455
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,980
Oh Sang Sik speaking.

456
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,490
Headquarters?

457
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,260
Mr. Oh Sang Sik?

458
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,480
Yes.

459
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,650
We're from headquarters.

460
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,150
We were checking on each affiliate's

461
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,360
belt-tightening policies 
and got a tip-off.

462
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,520
Tip-off?

463
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,100
<i>In the headquarters' 
monthly earnings statement,</i>

464
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,040
<i>there was a document 
regarding the issue</i>

465
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,220
<i>of Mr. Choi's business with China.</i>

466
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,500
I heard your team has a recording.

467
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,150
Recording, what's that about?

468
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,900
<i>The tip-off was from China.</i>

469
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,730
<i>It must've seemed smart to 
stay out of the strange game.</i>

470
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,320
<i>Though Mr. Oh's consolation 
came right after,</i>

471
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,560
<i>words were recorded and when a</i>

472
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,080
<i>contract employee 
pricked his conscience,</i>

473
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,080
<i>Mr. Seok indirectly agreed 
without overt denial.</i>

474
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,550
<i>He must've reported it 
to his boss with anxiety.</i>

475
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,040
<i>After receiving his report, the 
manager in China had a hot potato.</i>

476
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,020
<i>He got it over to 
headquarters right away.</i>

477
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,590
How many times are you asking me?

478
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,860
This is totally normal.

479
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,460
They're saying it's not right.

480
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,980
You've always worked like this, right?

481
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,770
I mean for a long time.

482
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:00,140
<i>Mr. Choi explained how he had worked
 for over many decades.</i>

483
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,540
But the scale has gone overboard.

484
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,180
<i>He thought he 
could persuade them.</i>

485
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,940
<i>But the reality was…</i>

486
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,620
We have all the data, sir.

487
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,100
Look here.

488
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,660
So didn't Mr. Choi proceed with this

489
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,460
business with strong conviction

490
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,400
without consideration of 
the company's profits?

491
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,260
Did any of the executives 
not have conviction?

492
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,660
Then I'll rephrase that.

493
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,070
You said connections are 
a custom in that society.

494
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,180
Then do you think this 
big scale is the norm?

495
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,260
It can be out of the norm 
depending on your viewpoint.

496
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,420
Did you say "viewpoint?"

497
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,580
Are you saying it could 
be viewed as the norm?

498
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,620
The trading business has many risks.

499
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,380
The connections, uncertainty,

500
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,880
and losses are all analyzed.

501
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,640
And for potential relations 
as a business partner…

502
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,310
Partner management could 
be the core to work.

503
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,960
They say it has changed,

504
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,900
but China is still all 
about connections.

505
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,850
It works despite the 
negative views on it.

506
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,480
<i>Those you leave at some point
are no good.</i>

507
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,040
Mr. Oh Sang Sik?

508
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,140
And for potential relations 
as a business partner,

509
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,880
connections have been 
made by investments.

510
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,660
I think the scale can be determined by

511
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,820
the potential profit we can acquire.

512
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,520
Then how come there 
are no connections

513
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,980
to be found in your past work?

514
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,240
Didn't you judge connections 
aren't justifiable?

515
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,840
And it seems the request to the China

516
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,920
resident employee for investigation

517
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,320
after Mr. Choi's order 
was made, is similar.

518
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,500
The president is here, sir.

519
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,500
Sir.

520
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,060
What brings you here?

521
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,700
You should've called me.

522
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,520
I met with Auditing team
 at headquarters.

523
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,040
Mr. Choi, it'll go with 
the proper procedure.

524
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,620
Sir, this is normal.

525
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,350
What's the problem with custom?

526
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,450
You're well aware of that.

527
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,160
And you said you trust me…

528
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,220
I was aware of it, but I don't

529
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,660
know if headquarters was too.

530
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,520

Mr. Jung, good job.

534
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,560
You should get promoted.

535
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,300
Ok.

536
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,640
Go back and work.

537
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
Go now.

538
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,020
No, sir.

539
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,410

00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,320
[Approval request]

542
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,820
[Oh Sang Sik, Choi Young Hoo]

543
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,820
Mr. Choi!

544
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,720
- I did it!
- What?

545
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,280
I got the deal for the 
offshore plant EPC case!

546
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,760
It's the first offshore 
plant case in Korea!

547
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,300
We did it!

548
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,830
Yes!

549
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,380
This is great!

550
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,730
We did it!

551
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,340
Come here!

552
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,160
<i>No, Sang Sik, you did it.</i>

553
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,420
<i>Mr. Choi was appointed to 
unlisted affiliate, One Global.</i>

554
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,600
<i>By raising issues regarding connections</i>

555
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,400
<i>and effort to improve
 the circumstances,</i>

556
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,140
<i>Mr. Oh and Sales Team 3</i>

557
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,780
<i>weren't punished.</i>

558
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,460
<i>Poshin stopped the solar</i>

559
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,700
<i>heat power plant business.</i>

560
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,260
<i>It was in protest to issues about</i>

561
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,570
<i>connections and 
Mr. Choi's punishment.</i>

562
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,740
Geu Rae.

563
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,260
Go shred this.

564
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,180
<i>Things were unsettled in the office.</i>

565
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,390
<i>Rumors about connections spread in 
Chinese firms we had relations with,</i>

566
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,480
<i>so some teams suffered direct losses.</i>

567
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,720
<i>The reason could be found in Mr. Oh's</i>

568
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,510
<i>inflexible work style and side effects.</i>

569
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,010
<i>As the days went by,</i>

570
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,820
<i>he was blamed for everything.</i>

571
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,200
<i>That strong Mr. Oh seemed to waver too.</i>

572
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,720
<i>And I knew.</i>

573
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,780
<i>That it all started with the careless</i>

574
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,720
<i>words of a certain contract employee.</i>

575
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,240
It's not your fault.

576
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,530
It's my fault.

577
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,080
I'm the one who got Mr. Seok

578
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,080
to find out all the details.

579
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,340
I'm the one who made the
whole company nervous

580
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,510
as well as you who knew nothing.

581
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,380
So I started it and ended it.

582
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,340
Geez, what's with you?

583
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,420
I told you not to be like this!

584
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,080
The one who should be responsible

585
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,980
and take responsibility is

586
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,380
the share and prerogative 
of those in that position.

587
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,620
I hate when you do this,

588
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,580
not knowing your place!

589
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,040
I just can't believe it,

590
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,140
it's just "OMG, OMG" as kids say!

591
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,180
It'll be tough.

592
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,500
The scale is different 
from Mr. Park's case.

593
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,550
You have one thing 
you're good at!

594
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,650
Patience!

595
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,440
Let's hang in there!

596
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,090
We're the tough Sales Team 3!

597
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,100
Look up.

598
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,930
Stand tall.

599
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,040
The bituminous coal contract 
went according to your request.

600
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,480
We reviewed other companies…

601
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,710
How can you ask to recheck the shipping 
contract right before production?

602
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,020
Don’t you know verbal contracts 
have legal validity too?

603
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,880
Isn't the contract regarding the

604
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,800
Chinese firm that even 
visited us many times?

605
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,200
That's right, ABD Shipping.

606
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,200
Right, ABD Shipping among 
all those companies.

607
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,820
They want to review the whole contract.

608
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,370
This is all because of Sales Team 3.

609
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:24,040
Mr. Oh asked about the agent regarding 
connections through Poshin,

610
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,680
and rumors must've spread to 
all the Chinese companies.

611
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,680
Why, that…

612
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,460
Mr. Choi leaving is making 
me anxious as it is.

613
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,200
Let's look for another shipping company.

614
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,100
I'll look into it now.

615
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,330
Negotiations are hard when it's urgent,

616
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,560
we can only choose 
from Japanese firms.

617
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,220
Their costs are so high.

618
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,360
Man, I'm going to write on the 
noticeboard, "Leave, Mr. Oh!"

619
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,880
I'll select a good company.

620
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,100
Young Yi.

621
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,940
I know you're worried about Mr. Oh,

622
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,980
but we're not the only issue here.

623
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,080
All the teams related to 
China will be influenced.

624
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,600
We could've continued business with

625
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,060
Poshin since our relations were good.

626
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,340
Don’t you know our team had no choice

627
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,290
with headquarters' auditing and all?

628
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,140
While we're on the subject,

629
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,440
did they have to find out that way?

630
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,760
It was wrapped up with righteous 
results and Mr. Choi's punishment,

631
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,740
but was it worth it?

632
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,680
Poshin stopped it as the 
issue got out of hand.

633
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,040
Exactly.

634
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,580
A trading man set up the whole

635
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,140
infrastructure and couldn't
 persuade the buyer.

636
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,220
Think of the potential loss of $0.5 bil.

637
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,880
How can you influence all 
businesses related to China?

638
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,590
<i>Please check the noticeboard.</i>

639
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:50,020
<i>If you have a conscience, 
you'll feel bad.</i>

640
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,320
Are you telling me to 
take responsibility?

641
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
That's not it.

642
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,620
I'm checking who's at fault 
from the company's viewpoint.

643
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,900
I'm telling you its position 
regarding customs.

644
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,750
Mr. Oh.

645
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,920
It's not your fault.

646
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,900
Time will solve everything, 
stop drinking.

647
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,400
No, keep drinking today. Here.

648
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,940
Mr. Choi fell into his own trap.

649
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,700
No one's at fault.

650
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,380
Times have changed, 
so how can he not?

651
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,680
Right?

652
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,620
He hasn't changed,

653
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,700
neither have I.

654
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,760
Shall I make you a boilermaker?

655
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,480
I'll make it for you.

656
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,280
When boilermakers and

657
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,720
Sales Team 3 get together,

658
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,200
that's it, a success.

659
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:22,580
Mr. Oh said it's a must for sales.

660
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,520
Here.

661
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,760
I'll feed you, Suk Yool.

662
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,320
Drink it, my arms hurt.

663
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,180
There you go.

664
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,100
It's ok.

665
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,580
Here.

666
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,180
Tissue, tissue.

667
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,380
It wasn't intentional, it's good.

668
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,200
It's ok.

669
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,940
Let go, I have to wipe this off.

670
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,380
You don't have to.

671
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,860
Oh, gosh.

672
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,720
I'm home.

673
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,560
Why are you so late?

674
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,080
You drank again?

675
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,760
You know about drinking?

676
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,120
I know better than you.

677
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,920
You need a snack?

678
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,920
You must need one after 
drinking so much.

679
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,540
Yeah, ramen!

680
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,900
With some green onion, yeah!

681
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,430
Ramen at midnight?

682
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,140
That's all we have.

683
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,420
Get up and eat this.

684
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,770
Your dad used to cook his

685
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,540
own ramen after drinking.

686
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,060
I'm cooking it for you when

687
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,280
I never cooked it for my honey.

688
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,160
Bon appetit.

689
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,940
Mr. Choi.

690
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,520
Hi there.

691
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,300
It's really cold, isn't it?

692
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,390
Yes.

693
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,530
How are you?

694
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,960
Good.

695
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,320
How about you?

696
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,820
I'm doing better than expected.

697
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,980
I worked for that company for 
28 years, and I was shocked when

698
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,200
they had an issue with my ways.

699
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,940
They say an executive is someone

700
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,720
who can see the stars on clouds

701
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,920
when everyone is 
looking at the ground.

702
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,320
I thought it was ok to jump above

703
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,270
the ground to get on the clouds.

704
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,600
How many people 
could possibly see the

705
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,940
stars with their feet on the ground?

706
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:22,350
But I learned my lesson.

707
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,450
Nevertheless,

708
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,090
the type of executive the company wants

709
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,840
is a giant who can see the stars

710
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,480
with their feet

711
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,360
on the ground.

712
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,640
When I first met you, Mr. Choi,

713
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,860
I was sure you'd be like that.

714
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,510
- Yeah?
- Yes,

715
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,900
I thought you were amazing.

716
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,500
I wanted to become like you.

717
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,640
Thanks for not bringing up other

718
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:16,260
issues during the auditing process.

719
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,200
I wanted to tell you that.

720
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,180
Are you talking about the 
doubts regarding the rebate?

721
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,700
They weren't doubts.

722
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,260
They're your groundless suspicions.

723
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,440
Yes,

724
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,560
that's why I couldn't bring it up.

725
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,760
It wasn't for your sake.

726
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:43,710
I just didn't have hard evidence 
though I had suspicions.

727
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,680
Just like with Lee Eun Ji.

728
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,850
I'm glad you're still working.

729
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:03,640
It's hard to see results in 
the global service business,

730
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,390
but performance is key.

731
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,680
But things will be tougher for you.

732
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:15,200
Since you affected China that way,

733
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,060
it won't be easy for you to

734
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,080
work in One International.

735
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,460
Is that so?

736
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,460
I don’t understand.

737
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,730
That's right.

738
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,700
<i>Mr. Choi was right.</i>

739
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,270
<i>We tried to work as usual,</i>

740
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:44,110
<i>but the company's atmosphere 
was still disturbed.</i>

741
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,920
Hi.
Where's Mr. Kim?

742
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,200
He's in a meeting.

743
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:56,390
Can I see the items' chart for Sudan?

744
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:00,160
Mr. Kim said he needs to give 
approval for everything.

745
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,160
What?

746
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,400
He told us not to show our 
data to anyone when he's away.

747
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,640
Give me the data.

748
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,240
Hey, buddy!

749
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,060
Our team worked on it too!

750
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,820
Why can't I see it?

751
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,880
I'm sorry, I'll take care 
of it after I tell Mr. Kim.

752
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,310
Let me see the data.

753
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:27,320
Mr. Kim, it's so hard 
to see a simple chart.

754
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,540
What?

755
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,400
You want me to go up there again?

756
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,380
Send it by messenger.

757
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,540
What are you trying to do now?

758
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,120
I get it.

759
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,000
Oh!

760
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,290
Is something wrong?

761
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,320
It's weird.

762
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,220
What's wrong?

763
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,200
About the import from Laos.

764
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,430
The finance manager 
has approved it too,

765
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:19,500
but the chief of the 
headquarters hasn't yet.

766
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,500
It was turned down.

767
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,760
This is too much.

768
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,540
Totally.

769
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,680
Dang.

770
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,100
Your team isn't even working 
on any businesses now.

771
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,950
Sales Team 3, Oh Sang Sik speaking.

772
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,600
Apparently there has never been so

773
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,560
many complaints from China before.

774
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:52,440
The Business Team doesn't know

775
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,740
how to take care of it now.

776
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,520
I'm sorry to say this,

777
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:08,540
but all the businesses you 
were involved with before,

778
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:12,600
and all those related to Sales Team 3

779
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,480
are being rejected.

780
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,990
The losses for other 
teams are increasing.

781
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,840
Are you saying we should

782
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,460
take responsibility?

783
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,140
Not necessarily.

784
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:43,920
Still personal responsibility…

785
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,600
Anyway Chinese companies are saying

786
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,120
they can't work with One International

787
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,140
since connections can be an issue.

788
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,560
So each team had to persuade them

789
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:03,280
<i>it wasn't the company's position,</i>

790
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,260
<i>but an arbitrary individual opinion.</i>

791
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,040
<i>But things aren't looking good.</i>

792
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,380
<i>So I think we need to make</i>

793
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,980
<i>a gesture that we fired you.</i>

794
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,590
<i>But we couldn’t fire an employee</i>

795
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,020
<i>that wasn’t even punished.</i>

796
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,460
So the company is saying I have

797
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,500
to leave for China to calm down.

798
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,100
That's not true.

799
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,360
No,

800
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,940
you know how they're 
treating our team.

801
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,100
I'll have to leave

802
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,780
for our team to survive.

803
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:54,300
The company will obviously 
want the fastest, easiest way.

804
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,460
But that's not the best way.

805
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,960
We can find the right way.

806
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,860
So wait till…

807
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,920
Then what?

808
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,460
What if all dies while waiting?

809
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,920
Mr. Oh.

810
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,700
So you'll hand in your 
resignation or something?

811
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,670
Resignation…

812
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,980
Yeah, resignation.

813
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,000
Mr. Oh.

814
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,180
It's ok.

815
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:31,080
It's not like they can't run without me.

816
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,490
All of us employees are 
ready to submit it.

817
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,820
We always dream of 
submitting it every night,

818
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,500
and go to work with it in our pockets.

819
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,680
I've been preparing myself mentally.

820
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,850
But…

821
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,200
But…

822
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,820
<i>I'm just worried about that kid.</i>

823
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,780
Go to bed, it's late.

824
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,100
You won't get much sleep 
before work tomorrow.

825
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,280
Can I

826
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,660
quit work?

827
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,380
No, you can't.

828
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,680
Right?

829
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,420
Are you quitting or getting fired?

830
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:08,680
I'm quitting

831
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,510
myself.

832
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,060
Ok.

833
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:41,660
But you remember
 we have three kids, right?

834
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,070
What?

835
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,740
Receive your bonus before you quit.

836
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,740
What?

837
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,650
Fridge.

838
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,930
TV.

839
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,820
Two computers.

840
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,820
What are you doing?

841
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,160
Things to buy before you quit.

842
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,240
You get an employees' discount.

843
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,510
I hate you.

844
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,480
Oh, hi Young Yi!

845
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,440
Mr. Oh.
You're early today.

846
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,430
Yeah, for a change.

847
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,230
You're looking good.

848
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,480
Your team must be treating you well.

849
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,840
Yes, there are no problems.

850
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,900
Yeah, the one who enjoys it wins!

851
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,810
Hello, Mr. Oh.

852
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,480
Good morning.

853
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,140
I was so focused on a bad boss that 
I couldn't think about your team.

854
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,820
I'll serve you better, Mr. Oh!

855
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:03,520
- You…
- Yes.

856
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,380
You should grow out your hair.

857
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,800
- I want to see your bob.
- Yes.

858
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,000
- I miss it.
- Yes.

859
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,260
Baek Ki's hair has no solution.

860
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,580
Let's go.

861
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,160
Let's go.

862
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,400
[Resignation]

863
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,580
I'm not dying.

864
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,840
I'm just leaving the company.

865
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,360
Geu Rae with extra quality

866
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,700
and quantity of effort.

867
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,750
Yes.

868
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,020
Hang in there.

869
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:29,620
What about you?

870
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,320
I've hung in there enough.

871
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,130
I want to take a break now.

872
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,220
My legs are shaking.

873
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,910
Make sure you win.

874
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,560
Even if you think you won't
 make it, fight to the end.

875
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,960
In life,

876
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,890
there are many things you start
 even if you know the end.

877
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,440
Geu Rae.

878
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,640
Yes.

879
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,760
I couldn't take

880
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,480
responsibility for you till the end.

881
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,430
I'm sorry.

882
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,040
Thanks for everything.

883
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,020
Mr. Oh.

884
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,220
I thought it through.

885
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,250
I told you we're ready to 
submit resignations every day.

886
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,320
Don't do this.

887
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,820
This too will pass.

888
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,440
Take care of Geu Rae.

889
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,920
I'm glad you're still working here.

890
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,200
Hurry up and get promoted.

891
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,240
That way, you can get Geu Rae

892
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,000
and Dong Sik promoted,

893
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,580
and help my team out.

894
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,340
Dang.

895
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,590
I'm just asking you 
for a bunch of favors.

896
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,360
Make sure to

897
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,920
get promoted next year.

898
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,480
Take care.

899
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,660
Hi.

900
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,840
What are you doing here?

901
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,400
Thank you.

902
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,190
Don't eat sandwiches alone.

903
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,320
You take these.

904
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,750
You know, Geu Rae?

905
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:03,860
When Mr. Chun first came, his 
hair was more rustic than yours.

906
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,900
You know how his hair was?

907
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,430
It was the same.

908
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,000
Maybe it was shorter, 
more like a mom.

909
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,480
But weren't I slimmer before?

910
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,580
"Slimmer" my foot.

911
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,070
I was slimmer.

912
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,080
Oh, Mr. Oh.

913
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,280
I heard Mr. Byun was laid off.

914
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,760
Really?

915
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,400
Just kidding.

916
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,420
You want to smell my new cologne?

917
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,260
No, no!

918
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:49,220
That's why you're still not married.

919
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:53,600
I wanted to quit after 
seeing him get married.

920
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,040
It'll happen someday, I'll hurry up.

921
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,440
My biggest regret

922
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,040
working here

923
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,420
is having this kid on our team.

924
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,560
This kid?

925
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,790
Who?

926
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:14,920
Not me, right?

927
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,160
What about me?

928
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,400
Let's say it's me.

929
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,770
It's me!

930
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,470
It's me!

931
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:29,400
It's me!

932
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,610
It's me!

933
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,480
Come here!

934
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,480
I'm going to pee.

935
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,340
- Mr. Chun.
- Yes.

936
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,500
You know how they're like?

937
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,040
I went to the hospital for IV therapy.

938
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,680
The company was in chaos.

939
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:51,290
It was a mess 
for every single guy.

940
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,400
What are you doing?

941
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,370
I didn't have a light for a smoke.

942
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,200
You quit.

943
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,200
Don’t smoke.

944
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,880
It's hard to quit.

945
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:50,120
I'm not drunk.

946
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:54,220
I'm fine, so don't follow me!

947
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,580
Yes.

948
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,000
Go!

949
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,240
Yes.

950
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,260
I said go.

951
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,270
Then I'll get going.

952
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,240
Ok.

953
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,520
Go.

954
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,540
Don't come visiting me just 
because you know my address.

955
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:25,740
Answer.

956
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,890
Yes.

957
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,920
Geu Rae.

958
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,630
Yes.

959
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,560
What did I say?

960
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,930
Hang in there.

961
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:45,930
What else?

962
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,640
Win.

963
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,080
Remember that.

964
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,540
Go now.

965
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,280
<i>Geu Rae with extra quality </i>

966
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,880
<i>and quantity of effort.</i>

967
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,120
I'm sorry.

968
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,560
<i>In life,</i>

969
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,520
<i>there are many things you start</i>

970
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,300
I'm sorry.

971
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,600
<i>even if you know the end.</i>

972
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,160
I'm sorry.

973
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,560
<i>Hang in there.</i>

974
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,640
I'm sorry.

975
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,920
Captivate me.

976
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,080
What?

977
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,080
Persuade me by captivating me.

978
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,780
What can you sell?

979
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,240
You could teach me

980
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,960
since I don't know.

981
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,300
You could give me an opportunity.

982
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,720
You need to be qualified 
to get the opportunity.

983
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,260
Get out, jerk!

984
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,530
Our kid got in trouble because

985
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:29,930
yours dropped a file!

986
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,260
Mailbox or message box…

987
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,680
What's the definition?

988
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,000
Hello, I'm new employee, 
Jang Geu Rae.

989
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,740
I'm here, Mr. Oh.

990
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,300
So

991
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,240
why you again?

992
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,060
I thought you had asked for me.

993
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:51,240
Contracts and approval requests, 
it's for the Resource Team!

994
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,280
Don't make them contact us again!

995
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,650
Yes.

996
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:02,280
Geu Rae.

997
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,280
What are you doing here?

998
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,230
Hello, Mr. Oh.

999
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,820
First Merry Christmas.

1000
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,680
- Who are you to say my judgment…!
- You're trying to save me.

1001
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,760
You're

1002
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,580
trying to make me a full-timer.

1003
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,920
<i>Isn't that why</i>

1004
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,190
<i>you're working with people 
who you normally never would?</i>

1005
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:36,240
Mr. Oh.

1006
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:42,980
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1007
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,220
Sorry...

1008
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,320
I'm so sorry.

1009
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:16,760
[Misaeng]

1010
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,240
Just because you can't see the road,
 doesn't mean it's not a road.

1011
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,340
Anything should be done.

1012
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:24,110
I'm just asking you for a fair 
evaluation, not special treatment.

1013
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:26,040
But it's not a solution.

1014
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,480
Let's do it.

1015
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,580
Geu Rae.

1016
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:31,360
Can I be ambitious again?
