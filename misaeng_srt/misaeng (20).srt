00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:46,710
After Mr. Oh left, our team 
became stable as he had wished.

3
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,850
Hi.

4
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,970
You're early.

5
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,630
Hello.

6
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,790
What did Legal team say about 
the Malaysia complaint?

7
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,590
They're reviewing it, and fortunately, 
it'll be smooth since our fault isn't big.

8
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,230
There will be a meeting 
at 3:00 tomorrow.

9
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,830
Ok, good job.

10
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,960
I wonder why Japan isn't replying yet.

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,070
- Mr. Hwang, here.
- What?

12
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,060
Do this today.

13
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,350
- Yes, sir.
- Ok.

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,070
The remaining people were 
making efforts for me.

15
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,670
The more they did, the more
 reasons there were for me to leave.

16
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,110
The reason I stay despite that?

17
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,420
Geu Rae.

18
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,990
What did I say?

19
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,760
Hang in there.

20
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,260
Hang in there.

21
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,090
What else?

22
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,470
Make sure you

23
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,300
win.

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,170
Win.

25
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,270
Remember that.

26
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,100
That's why.

27
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,340
Even if you think you won't 
make it, fight to the end.

In life,

29
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,110
there are many things 
you start knowing the end.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,370
That's

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,080
why.

32
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,210
The day which is the end 
is approaching.

33
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,830
Would you all like some coffee?

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,360
Alright.

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,100
Sounds good.

36
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,030
Ok.

[Episode 20 (Final Episode)]

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,190
April is the cruelest month, breeding

40
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,250
lilacs out of the dead land, mixing

41
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,300
memory and desire, stirring

42
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,300
dull roots with spring rain.

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,150
You feel me, don't you, Geu Rae?

44
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,930
Don't you feel ticklish down 
to your bones, Geu Rae?

45
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,930
If you're itchy, go to a sauna.

46
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,340
You're dirty.

47
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,880
Dirty love?

48
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,860
Which teams are going for 
the transition meeting?

49
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,230
Wasn't it us, Sales Team 1, 
Resource, Steel, and Fabric?

50
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,970
We can stay, right?

51
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,310
Yes.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,630
Transition meetings give 
me a sense of d??vu.

53
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,890
D??vu?

54
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,840
Oh, Mr. Ma and Mr. Oh's conflict?

55
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,780
I'll get going.

56
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,970
I need to finish organizing the receipts.

57
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,180
- Go ahead.
- Ok.

The contract due date is approaching 
and there's no solution.

59
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,090
Mr. Kim and Mr. Chun are doing their 
best, but they can only do so much.

60
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,260
And they can't do anything about it.

61
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,830
But Ms. Sun is doing her best.

62
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,370
I want to do anything I can to help.

63
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,930
Is the Myanmar case bidding complete?

64
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,210
No, sir.

65
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,220
Myanmar is special, so I went 
with the original company.

66
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,710
You guys just proceed without approval?

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,790
Sir,

68
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,770
this is how we worked up till now.

69
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,130
This is how "we" worked?

70
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,800
And how is that?

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,770
You guys have your own way,

72
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,790
so just shut up and go with it?

73
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,310
No, sir, I mean?

74
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,610
Just go with what I say.

75
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,580
Must I explain and 
convince you each time?

76
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,680
- Coffee, please.
- Yes.

77
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,490
I've been watching you guys,

78
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,590
so you want to argue
 about everything?

79
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,630
Are you taking this seriously?

80
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,600
You know?

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,310
Don't explain things to me.

82
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,870
Tell me through the papers.

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,310
What's there to repeat over and over

85
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,510

86
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,070
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

Aren't you tired of blabbering 
at the end of a day?

91
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,020
proper new employee next time.

92
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,970

93
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,150
so work hard until then.

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,460
Get to work.

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,970
I asked you for a lot of water.

96
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,510
I asked you for so much 
water, it seems too watery.

97
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,150
I'm sorry, I'll get you another cup.

98
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,350

Hey.

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,250
What happened to the Chungsol payment?

101
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,630
The items came over ages ago!

102
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,030
You want to be sued?

103
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,390
Many documents are missing 
including a quality guarantee.

104
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,710
They said they'd send it.

105
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,910
Then they will!

106
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,530
Even if I input payment in the ERP,

107
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,870
you think they'd take responsibility 
for the missing files after that?

108
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,180
If an issue arises because of that,

109
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,290
I'd have to take responsibility.

110
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,490
Responsibility?

111
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,910
You love responsibility, don?t you?

112
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,930
How on earth were you raised at home?

113
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,690
You trust no one and 
you're a selfish mess.

114
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,190
Why do you go crazy 
over the Chungsol case?

115
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,150
Raised at home, go crazy?

116
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,070
Take care of the payment ASAP, ok?

117
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,510

Since we're receiving the payment 
through mineral resources,

142
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,450
I'd like Resource to take care of it.

143
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,820
So why receive the payment 
through mineral resources?

144
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,220

for related businesses, sir.

Yes.

157

We'll research about the 
consumers and demands.

158
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,830
Why should your team do that?

159
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,830
We can do that, right, Mr. Jung?

160
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,940

161
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,870

Wrap up individually too.

167
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,370
Yes, it's true that there's a 
price drop in raw materials as

168

But the market of Canadian chromium, 
nickel, and platinum is still large.

a variety of synergy effects 
among this consortium.

172

schedule by email as soon as possible.

- Is it over?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,480
This is pitiful.

179

Ever since Mr. Jung attacked him, 
Mr. Ma doesn't care about us.

180
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,010
What if we end up sitting 
next to the restroom?

181
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,310
Be quiet, let's just hope we don't.

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,250
I hope our luck gets better.

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,160
When will that happen?

184
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,930
The day you retire?

185
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,590
Mr. Yoo, you still 
haven't gone to London?

186
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,270
I wish dept. heads were 
contract employees.

187
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,030
Young Yi.

188
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,450
Geu Rae is leaving soon, right?

189
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,350
Yes.

190
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,450
Mr. Kim will suffer the most 
after he does.

191
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,250
Yeah, you have to train 
interns and newbies.

192
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,790
That's if Geu Rae's successor comes.

193
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,560
Right, their team rarely had newbies.

194
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,810
But he really can't sign 
another contract, right?

195
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,650
Why would the company sign 
him on as a full-timer?

196
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,130
Ms. Sun and the team seemed 
to be making efforts.

197
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,490
But it won't produce any results.

198
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,090
I'm sure they know too.

199
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,040
I thought I'd just have to do my

200
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,130
share despite who became my partner,

201
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,990
but I preferred someone

202
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,630
I could communicate with.

203
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,630
I just wanted to tell you.

204
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,030
I didn't have the ulterior

205
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,810
motives you're thinking of.

206
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,970
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,980
No, apologize after getting the job.

208
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,850
Young Yi.

209
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,790
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,790
Congratulations.

211
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,030
Thank you.

212
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,130
It's sad, isn't it?

213
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,390
The four of you started work together.

214
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,370
Is there really no solution?

215
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,390
That's all I think about these days.

216
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,390
There isn't.

217
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,730
Maybe you can start a movement.

218
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,030
Movement?

219
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,090
The more the better, you know.

220
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,070
The company can reconsider

221
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,190
it if many people think about.

222
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,350
Though it's not a solution.

223
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,270
Start a movement?

224
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,250
Mr. Ha meant we should try to make

225
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,450
the company understand Geu Rae.

226
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,650
That he's worth keeping 
and he has to stay.

227
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,730
How?

228
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,230
Yeah, we can't have 
a presentation for him,

229
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,590
or put up posters like in college.

230
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,230
We can't go to upper management 
like in the dramas.

231
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,740
Why not?

232
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,530
We can go, talk, convince,
and cry out loud.

233
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,910
This is like the last resort.

234
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,490
They ruin someone's
 life instantaneously.

235
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,720
Why's it so hard 
to see the real of a person?

236
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,190
Where are you going?

237
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,930
I have to do something.

238
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,460
I'll try the method that 
made me fool once.

239
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,630
I'll get going.

240
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,950
I think there's something I can do.

241
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,250
What?

242
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,490
Hi, Young Yi.

243
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,690
Ms. Sun,

244
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,630
I have a favor.

245
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,420
I'm Fabric Team 1, Han Suk Yool.

246
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,540
It's been nearly two years since 
I've started working here.

247
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,500
I had contacted you before 
because of an unpleasant issue.

248
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,340
I'd like to apologize first.

249
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,740
The reason I'm apologizing first

250
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,440
is so people won't close the window

251
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,730
just by the mention of my name.

252
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,680
I'd like to ask an

253
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,740
important favor today.

254
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,220
Two year contract employee Jang Geu Rae
 has started work with me

255
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,380
and he's working in Sales Team 3.

256
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,710
I hope he can become a full-timer.

257
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,150
You can't ignore 
Jang Geu Rae's performance.

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,420
Well, I know.

259
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,480
The interns were always 
complaining he started through

260
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,820
connections and special treatment.

261
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,640
That's not necessarily true.

262
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,880
We'd like a fair evaluation,

263
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,100
not special treatment.

264
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,870
He passed the presentation 
interview with me two years ago.

265
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,000
He joined Sales Team 3.

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,180
He was the first of us to be in a

267
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,460
presentation with upper management.

268
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,440
That radical presentation brought the

269
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,800
Jordan used car business to success.

270
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,540
We owe it to Jang Geu Rae.

271
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,920
Connections.

272
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,850
Yes, people called him the GED

273
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,500
Jang Geu Rae who used
 his connections to get the job.

274
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,430
So when we all entered as a full-timer,

275
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,340
he joined as a two year
 contract employee.

276
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,740
He had to suffer various 
insults since his intern days.

277
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,270
But he worked harder
 than anyone else

278
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,540
thinking of One International 
as our company.

279
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,080
Is that for Geu Rae?

280
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,740
Yes.

281
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,100
I'm hoping it would help.

282
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,880
I'll make files proving his 
performance for our team.

283
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,400
Yeah, such portfolios are necessary 
for full-timer transition evaluations.

284
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,700
I'll take a look when you're done.

285
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,420
Yes, sir.

286
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,580
He'd come to work with us,

287
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,900
and leave after we do.

288
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,600
He worked so hard to make up

289
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,790
for his lacking experiences.

290
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,620
When the item he planned 
he was excluded

291
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,290
because he was a contract employee,

292
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,840
he gave up on it without 
a complaint.

293
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,960
Please change it.

294
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,220
I've

295
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,500
never been so embarrassed 
of my specifications before.

296
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,780
I feel that way too.

297
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,870
How can specifications 
make someone's

298
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,940
treatment so different from another?

299
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,440
Why should one's effort be

300
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,280
treated differently from others?

301
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,850
That must be reflected in regulations,

302
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,650
but transition to 
a full-timer is impossible.

303
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,020
Yes, you're right.

304
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,720
But I'm just asking you that 
he won't be evaluated unfairly

305
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,540
in a standard evaluation

306
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,820
due to Mr. Choi's incident.

307
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,900
Please, sir.

308
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,520
The basics are key to evaluate 
one's adaptability to work life.

309
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,940
Though it was hard to prove

310
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,540
his basics at the starting point,

311
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,400
he has shown enough potential 
during the last two years.

312
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,320
Jang Geu Rae must become a full-timer.

313
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,390
He said,

314
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,420
"I'll sell this fabric with you, 
Suk Yool."

315
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,660
Please help me keep that promise.

316
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,730
I've had my shameful moments,

317
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,570
but I'd like to keep that promise.

318
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,400
Please.

319
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,860
Please check the payment regarding 
the Malaysia contact lenses.

320
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,360
Yes, the proposal review is complete, 
it's doubled because of the stock.

321
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,040
I'd appreciate a prompt reply.

322
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,480
Each team can send one employee for

323
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,940
college graduate intern selections.

324
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,020
Wow, new interns after two years.

325
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,740
Yeah.

326
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,810
It's like Geu Rae came yesterday.

327
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,720
Nice to have a successor, isn't it?

328
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,220
Show them as the senior.

329
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,460
Go.

330
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,820
Yes, I'll be back.

331
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,480
- I'll be back.
- Go.

332
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,920
Let's have a talk.

333
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,100
What kind of possibility?

334
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,800
Headquarters will send guidelines 
to the company soon.

335
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,570
Competent contract employees will be

336
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,040
transitioned to full-time positions.

337
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,560
It's an opinion among 
upper management,

338
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,260
so we will go by those 
guidelines too.

339
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,850
Trends are changing.

340
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,950
Please help out, Mr. Chun and Mr. Kim.

341
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,980
I'll do my best too.

342
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,460
First of all, make a file of all

343
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,240
of Geu Rae's performance results.

344
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,360
Yes, sure.

345
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,870
Yes!

346
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,010
Hey, hey!

347
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,880
Let's do it, Geu Rae.

348
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,660
Can I

349
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,460
be ambitious again?

350
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,140
I'm back.

351
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,880
You're so late!

352
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,240
Sorry, sorry, ma'am.

353
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,460
You have a bunch of 
deliveries waiting!

354
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,140
The door will have to be 
fixed to shut tightly.

355
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,240
You drive me crazy.

356
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,500
Welcome.

357
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,060
I'll have a rice roll.

358
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,080
Sure.

359
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,080
We'll have two ramens 
and one rice roll.

360
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,140
Sure.

361
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,540
Hey, how's your intern?

362
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,130
Geez, you know that 
the college graduate

363
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,500
did not knowing 
how to make copies?

364
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,060
He came to you?

365
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,540
Ha, he called his mom to ask her

366
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,140
in front of the copy machine.

367
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,780
Geez.

368
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,480
Gosh.

369
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
Unbelievable.

370
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,410
So I don't know how to do it.

371
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:26,180
You could teach me since I don't know.

372
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,980
You could give me an opportunity.

373
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,180
Thank you, I'm starving.

374
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,700
Thank you, so hungry.

[Kim Dong Sik]

376
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,460
Sorry, I missed your kid's

377
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,100
birthday because of a business trip.

378
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,440
[Sun Ji Young]

379
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,060
Hi, Ms. Sun.

380
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,680
Mr. Oh.

381
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,900
Long time no see, how are you?

382
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,340
Don't worry.

383
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,200
I feed myself.

384
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,400
I'll settle things here,

385
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,360
so come if you get fired.

386
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,180
Trust me.

387
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,200
I'll set a red carpet, so if 
you can't deal with it anymore,

388
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,640
just tell Mr. Ma 
you'll quit and come.

389
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,740
Why Mr. Ma when he's 
not even our boss?

390
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah?

391
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,680
About Geu Rae.

392
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,940
He passed HR's evaluation today

393
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,840
and it was brought up in 
the Admin. Team's meeting.

394
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,060
We just need the participants' 
majority vote.

395
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,780
Looks like Geu Rae's 
transition will be

396
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,980
smooth from the various 
circumstances.

397
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,080
Ok.

398
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,940
That's great.

399
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,700
Thanks.

400
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,080
Keep working hard.

401
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,570
When will the results be in?

402
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,900
Tomorrow.

403
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,320
Ok.

404
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,020
Thanks.

405
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,140
Bye.

406
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,900
Not yet?

407
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,140
No.

408
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,740
I think it'll go smoothly since 
Ms. Sun is in the meeting.

409
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,240
I overheard Mr. Ma and Mr. Jung talking.

410
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,780
It seemed positive since 
it was an upper discussion.

411
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,420
Plus, Geu Rae's performance was

412
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,360
great with lots of referrals.

413
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,380
Hello.

414
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,300
What's keeping you so busy all day?

415
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,620
I have to submit some things by 5:00.

416
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,980
Let's have lunch together.

417
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,280
I won't be able to make it as I'll need

418
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,480
to have a quick lunch while I work.

419
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,360
Ok.

420
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,620
Geu Rae.

421
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,020
You're in charge of the Shenzhen 
export case for China, right?

422
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,420
I heard there was a request 
for additional supplies.

423
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,280
Yes.

424
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,040
Shouldn't our team work 
on a Chinese item too?

425
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,420
Yeah.

426
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,180
We don't have to worry 
about your team, do we?

427
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,620
You'll have to.

428
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,860
I don't want to.

429
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,300
- Have a good day.
- You too.

430
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,500
Have a good day.

431
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,180
Hello.

432
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,300
Geu Rae, I put the file about

433
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,640
recycling fridges on your desk.

434
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,180
It's about copper, aluminum,
and plastic excluding steel,

435
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,780
so it'll be easy to understand.

436
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,320
Thank you.

437
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,110
Oh, and can I see last quarter's TF

438
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,800
team business report this evening?

439
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,780
Yes, I gave it to Baek Ki
 in the morning.

440
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,840
Thanks.

441
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,780
Geu Rae, let's have a drink someday.

442
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,250
Yes, thank you.

443
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,480
Where are the Malaysia files?

444
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Ms. Sun is coming.

445
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,060
What is this?

446
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,250
I sent it since there's a new system.

447
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,890
I'm frigging sorry.

448
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,660
I work as a trading man 
for this moment.

449
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,020
Congratulations.

450
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,500
Pay me some respect!

451
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,360
Speak for yourself!

452
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,760
Everyone's saying what they want,

453
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,450
why can't you say anything?

454
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,300
I'd like to get to know

455
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,620
you better, Geu Rae.

456
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,640
You're here,

457
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,880
so hang in there.

458
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,080
Surviving is winning here.

459
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,100
Surviving means going towards

460
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,630
a complete life somehow.

461
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,600
We all have incomplete lives yet.

462
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,070
Ok, the contract is here!

463
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,140
You know the chicken 
place owner nagged

464
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,320
me for a month after 
the helmet test?

465
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,520
When they're looking for a Korean 
product that will beat Japanese ones,

466
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,150
you can't discuss Vietnamese 
buyers without being stood up yourself.

467
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,760
They want the strongest, 
lightest item with

468
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,080
the best ventilation system 
and air resistance.

469
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,490
Oh, yes, you're the export king

470
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,600
and we got the deal thanks to you.

471
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,720
And the Vietnam helmet export

472
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,840
has the best profits.

473
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,440
Moon Choong Gi  is here.

474
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
What did you say?

475
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,100
Meccaphone!

476
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,580
Take a look.

477
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,680
I can't do it!

478
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,690
Hey.

479
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,630
Are you disregarding me since 
I am a salary CEO?

480
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,740
You guys invited me as a professional 
executive, so you should listen.

481
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,980
What?

482
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,200
You're acting all arrogant because 
you invested half of the company?

483
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,640
My life was so easy getting off

484
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,920
at six sharp at One Aluminum.

485
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,540
Nice.

486
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,720
It's a good item.

487
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,140
So?

488
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,550
Nice, isn't it?

489
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,680
It's a good item.

490
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,120
It's good.

491
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,880
Let's work together.

492
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,280
Let's do it.

493
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,780
But let's have another CEO.

494
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,640
Neither me nor you.

495
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,780
What?

496
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,460
Let's bring Kim Boo Ryun over.

497
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,000
Kim Boo Ryun?

498
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,340
That cold guy?

499
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,960
He's such an aggressive perfectionist.

500
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
If you don't agree,

501
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,660
I won't do it.

502
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,820
Getting off on time is most 
important for employees.

503
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,000
I know you worked late every day.

504
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,780
And come on, half?

505
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,840
I invested 51% and Kim 49%!

506
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,700
This company should be run 51-49!

507
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,360
So 51!

508
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,760
Do mecca phone when I ask nicely.

509
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,460
Gosh, that Moon Choong Gi!

510
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,600
Geez.

511
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,300
Mr. Kim, go in and talk with the CEO.

512
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,380
[Milk day]

513
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,380
The milk is almost ready.

514
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,740
Time to drink it.

515
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,480
I'll go to Youngjin.

516
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,860
See you later.

517
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,860
Hello?

518
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,920
Hello?

519
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,320
My kiddo!

520
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Dad, buy me fried chicken!

521
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,400
Spicy half, fried half!

522
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,720
Give it to me.

523
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,980
Clean up.

524
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,180
Your company changed, but why

525
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,910
do you get off at the same hour?

526
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,540
You said you'd reflect on your 
life at your new company.

527
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,920
You said you'd talk 
a lot with the kids.

528
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,020
You said we'd see the Jejudo beach,

529
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,260
and we never went there.

530
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,930
"Camping" my foot.

531
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,430
You said you'd fix the curtains,

532
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,960
but you've been busy for four days!

533
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,220
So?

534
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,420
What time will you come?

535
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,120
I'll be late after 
visiting three clients.

536
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,140
Ok, I'll eat.

537
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,640
Ok.

538
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,040
Bye.

539
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,070
I heard the San Paolo items arrived.

540
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,220
Oh, I was wrong.

541
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,040
Go pick them up at the airport.

542
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,100
I was working near there.

543
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,980
It would've been perfect 
to go after lunch.

544
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,350
But you said it already arrived.

545
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,720
I ran over skipping lunch.

546
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,940
You did?

547
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,580
I didn't know that.

548
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,220
You should've told me.

549
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,230
Still here?

550
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,540
Suk Yool.

551
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,370
You can't take a leave.

552
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,160
There will be a security 
educating session.

553
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,400
Educating?
I checked.

554
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,120
It just came up.

555
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,640
Put off your leave.

556
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,140
Did you set it for
 tomorrow on purpose?

557
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,560
I told you and got approval too,

558
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,720
it's my dad's birthday and fa?!

559
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,580
Family trip.

560
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,860
How can I put off my dad's birthday?

561
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,040
Why'd you take 
a leave like that, fool?

562
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,320
Are you yelling at me now?

563
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,220
Put off your leave if I tell you to!

564
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,140
Should we put off Mr. Jung's 
business trip again?

565
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,440
Hello?

566
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,720
Hi, how are you?

567
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,160
I'm free.

568
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,080
Let's have a drink.

569
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,740
Ok.
Bye.

570
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,320
Sung Joon Sik in Fabric Team 1 is

571
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,820
having an inappropriate relationship

572
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,280
with Chungsol's Mrs. Lee Gyung Sun,

573
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,540
bringing huge losses to our business,

574
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,280
so please look into this.

575
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:33,070
[Suggestions]

576
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,000
Dang.

577
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,740
Mom, sorry I can't go.

578
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,820
I was busy with work.

579
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,220
Of course, I earn all 
the money in Seoul.

580
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,660
Mm-hmm.

581
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,780
I know dad is disappointed.

582
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,420
Let me talk to him for a minute.

583
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,360
What?

584
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,580
He won't take the phone?

585
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,620
Have a good time at 
the warm country.

586
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,480
I'll make sure to go next year.

587
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,580
Yes.

588
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,880
Bye.

589
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,840
Man, oh, man.

590
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,780
You should've just received a bribe.

591
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,540
Then it'd be easy for 
me to tell on you.

592
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,020
You call that a life?

593
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,280
Excuse me.

594
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,760
Is there Sung Joon Sik here?

595
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,510
Right there.

596
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,010
In white?

597
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,460
Thank you.

598
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,680
Are you Mr. Sung Joon Sik?

599
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,280
Yes.

600
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,860
Are you Mr. Sung?

601
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,220
Yes.

602
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,600
Hey.

603
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,020
Hey.

604
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,780
You're Sung Joon Sik?

605
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,900
Sung Joon Sik?

606
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,200
Who do you think you are?

607
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,680
You know Lee Gyung Sun, right?

608
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,000
From Chungsol?

609
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,800
Yeah, from Chungsol's Fabric Team.

610
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,840
She's our client, what about her?

611
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,680
Who are you?

612
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,210
Who am I?

613
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,310
Who am I?

614
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,650
Who do you think I am?

615
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,080
Who do you think?

616
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,090
Hey, what did you do with my wife?

617
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,430
What are you talking about?

618
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,300
Yeah, I knew you'd deny it, 
so I took all these shots.

619
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,880
Look.

620
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,570
Is this you kissing her or not?

621
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,370
You still don't know?

622
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,370
- I think it's me?
- Look!

623
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,400
"I think it's me?"

624
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,610
Hey, you jerk!

625
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,280
Sorry.

626
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,360
Come here, man!

627
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,250
- Suk Yool.
- You're running away?

628
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,380
Come here, man!

629
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,140
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

630
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,720
- Now you're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

631
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,160
Now you're sorry?

632
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,460
Please calm down, 
you can't do this here.

633
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,200
How far did you go?

634
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,180
What did you do and
 how far did you go?

635
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,540
Don't tell me!

636
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,680
Come here, man!

637
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,710
Come here, man!

638
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,710
Come here, jerk!

639
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,420
I'm sorry.

640
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,150
Hey, come here!

641
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,220
Come here.

642
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,050
I'm sorry.

643
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,980
What did she give to you?

644
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,960
Give it to me now!

645
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,430
This watch.

646
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,300
Shoes.

647
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,940
Wait, my socks.

648
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,440
Tie.

649
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,970
Not those!

650
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,140
Are you joking now?

651
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,440
Car keys.

652
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,950
Here, car keys.

653
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,340
But this is mine!

654
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,620
Hey, man!

655
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,650
I'm sorry.

656
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,460
Hey, hey!

657
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,740
Please, you can't do this here?

658
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,340
Ajusshi, has your wife 
had an affair before?

659
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,340
[Ahjusshi: middle-aged man]

660
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,320
- Not yet.
- Right?

661
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,500
Then you don't know how I feel.

662
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,720
Come here.

663
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,400
Why do you live like this?

664
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,400
I told you to bring 
a wet tissue, not this.

665
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,360
Baek Ki.

666
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,480
Yes.

667
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,560
You achieved 150% of the 
expected quarter performance.

668
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,960
Yes.

669
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,440
You'll catch up to Mr. Kang soon.

670
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,480
No, sir.

671
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,160
You better be on your toes.

672
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,950
Congratulations.

673
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,380
Thank you.

674
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:16,900
And I printed out 
the email for Germany.

675
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,800
You hadn't revised 
the word I checked.

676
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,300
Sir,

677
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,180
that "Z" should be capitalized.

678
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,100
Since honorifics are needed here.

679
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,450
Yeah?

680
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,760
Yes.

681
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,120
And Mr. Kang.

682
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,840
There's something I didn't 
tell you last time.

683
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,660
When you pronounce the

684
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,700
"w" sound in German,

685
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,700
you told me to make it

686
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,470
sound like I'm gagging

687
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,970
after putting my toothbrush
 too deep in.

688
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,970
Yes.

689
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,500
Yes.

690
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,980
Actually,

691
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,380
it should sound like you're popping

692
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,720
out condensed air from your mouth,

693
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,900
not your nose like this?

694
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,740
That's how you say it.

695
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,240
So?

696
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:51,320
Is that so?

697
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,020
That's what my German 
academy taught me.

698
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,340
Which academy did you go to?

699
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,530
Wa Germany Academy.

700
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,610
My classmate teaches there.

701
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,890
I can't make it to lunch. - Suk Yool.

702
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,440
You really can't eat it?

703
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,480
Uh?

704
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,540
You've seen enough scary movies,

705
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,300
let's bring it up a notch.

706
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,200
I'll eat it if you can't.

707
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,240
You said you wouldn't be 
able to eat due to work.

708
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,540
I was so hungry, I grew 
supernatural powers.

709
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,360
Is Mr. Sung ok?

710
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,820
His whole face is a mess 
and he's so embarrassed.

711
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,720
I wonder if he can 
continue coming to work.

712
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,280
It's ok, he's a psychopath.

713
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,800
But

714
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,660
when did you two watch a movie?

715
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,930
I love movies too.

716
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,420
You shouldn't discriminate people.

717
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,480
- You like scary movies too?
- Are you crazy?

718
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,720
Why watch those when you have 
so many good flicks out there?

719
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,300
I miss Geu Rae.

720
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,060
Three out of four of us just

721
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,540
isn't symmetrical.

722
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,520
What is this?

723
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,260
If the subject is an item, 
use the active voice.

724
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,700
If the subject is a person, 
use the passive voice.

725
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,360
For example, this class is interesting.

726
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,500
This class is interesting.

727
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,800
Mr. Park opened a restaurant,

728
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,950
and he's looking for 
a manager or whatever.

729
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,600
Are you interested?

730
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,380
No, tell him thanks, but no thanks.

731
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,380
You have other options?

732
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,600
I'll have to make my options,
 study more too.

733
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Has your Chinese improved?

734
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,920
Let me hear your Chinese.

735
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,180
Ni hao.

736
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,180
[Ni: derogatory term 
for "you" in Korean]

737
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,160
How could you talk 
like that to your mom?

738
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,640
Forget it.

739
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,180
I can't teach you anything 
since you don't know.

740
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,680
Young Yi.

741
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,620
Young Yi.

742
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,880
Hi.

743
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,080
It's been three weeks.

744
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,480
Yes.

745
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,800
It feels like three years since we 
used to see each other every day.

746
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,900
You left just like that

747
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,960
without a farewell party.

748
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,920
You might've left like 
that to start anew,

749
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,400
but we all felt a bit guilty.

750
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,560
Come on.

751
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,020
After you left, Suk Yool is
 so disheartened,

752
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,100
he doesn't even come downstairs.

753
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,290
We have new interns now.

754
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,930
But no one makes 
an impression like you.

755
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,570
What?

756
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,580
Oh, they're here.

757
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,910
Long time no see, Geu Rae.

758
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,640
Hi.

759
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,210
Geu Rae.

760
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,180
I wish the love were 9-to-6.

761
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,360
What the? wait.

762
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
What, what?

763
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,320
Here.

764
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,560
Thanks.

765
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,340
- What about me?
- Me?

766
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,580
I'm jobless.

767
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,900
Glad to be here.

768
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,000
I want to get off from the company

769
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,300
called your heart, 
but I keep working late.

770
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,860
Then don't ever go home?

771
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,640
Stop it.

772
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:26,850
I'm sure Geu Rae 
doesn't feel like that.

773
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,790
Will you stop it?

774
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,500
Tell me, Geu Rae.

775
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,630
What am I to you?

776
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,340
Am I of any importance to you?

777
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,860
- Stop it now.
- Stop it.

778
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,760
That wasn't funny?

779
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:45,520
Mr. Oh didn't ask you to come?

780
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,080
He could feel sorry about inviting

781
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,110
him to an unsettled company.

782
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,100
That's true.

783
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,980
He could be thinking an adventure

784
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,860
for himself is enough.

785
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,380
Why don't you give him a call?

786
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,080
What?

787
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,340
Yeah, just call to say hi.

788
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,470
Geu Rae.

789
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,120
You can't just join and leave

790
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,320
a company as you wish.

791
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,680
Like I can't control the 
love I have for you.

792
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,080
Stop it!

793
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,620
Suk Yool, eat this.

794
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,620
Stop it.

795
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:43,000
Growing apart

796
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,080
When I thought youth

797
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,670
would stay forever

798
00:54:54,670 --> 00:55:03,400
The seasons will return again

799
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,640
You can't help but 
sing thinking of how

800
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,620
you can play while everyone works?

801
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,930
Mr. Oh.

802
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,000
What brings you here?

803
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,800
- Are you done getting settled?
- What?

804
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,890
It's been three weeks already.

805
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,480
The milk is ready.

806
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,400
The suit, dress shirt, 
and tie are ready.

807
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,680
Suitcase too.

808
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,240
Shoes too.

809
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
You can come anytime.

810
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,060
Yes.

811
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:01,540
So the TS has to be complete for us too.

812
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,160
It's because of the complaint, so you

813
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,830
can't say it's been discarded already.

814
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,300
Who would believe that?

815
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,980
Exactly.

816
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,840
Sales Team 3 intern, 
Kim Geun Young speaking.

817
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,020
Yes.

818
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,180
Hello?

819
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,220
Dong Sik, has the Philippines 
payment been made yet?

820
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,280
Will you hurry with that?

821
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,960
They keep calling us.

822
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,400
- Geez.
- Yes, sir.

823
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,820
Sales Team 3, Kim Dong Sik speaking.

824
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,660
Sir.

825
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,400
A meeting tomorrow?
Please hold on.

826
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,970
Yes.

827
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,100
Yes.

828
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,460
Yes, I made reservations 
for 5:00 at Hwaryun.

829
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,500
Yes, sir.

830
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,300
Time goes by slow these days.

831
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,800
It used to fly.

832
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,670
It's no fun.

833
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,360
You still look for fun from work?

834
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,580
I know.

835
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,680
Drink it.

836
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,720
What?

837
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,530
Drink it.

838
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,860
Alright.

839
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,240
I wonder why

840
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,670
I feel lonely.

841
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,680
It's weird.

842
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,180
It was like this at 
One International too.

843
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,640
Hello, Mr. Oh.

844
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,780
Hi.

845
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,860
Hello, sir.

846
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,740
Hi.

847
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,340
It's ready on your desk.

848
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,270
Thanks.

849
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:37,040
Did you send the Uzbekistan invoice 
packing list, bill and all?

850
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,860
I did a couple hours ago.

851
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,360
Mr. Oh.

852
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,500
Yeah?

853
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,340
I always had this question.

854
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,620
What?

855
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,380
I'm busy, hurry up.

856
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,440
Why do you always put your 
family photo faced down?

857
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,680
What?

858
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,300
It's noisy, you haven't

859
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,580
heard my wife nag before.

860
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,040
Once in a while it's fine.

861
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,560
If it continues, it sounds 
like a barking dog.

862
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,840
Do you even know what I mean?

863
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,220
What happened to the 
experienced employee case?

864
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,140
The hits are increasing, but 
I haven't gotten any replies.

865
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:24,620
Oh, yeah, what about 
using the new material?

866
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:28,600
I heard the restrictions have been 
lifted, and it can be sponsored.

867
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,720
Yeah?

868
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,720
- I'll look into it.
- Mm-hmm.

869
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,360
I wasn't going to fling the door open.

870
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,560
That's my seat.

871
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,780
The Trade Association 
should be calling.

872
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,980
What should I do now?

873
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,620
Oh, Mr. Kim!

874
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,240
CEO Kim.

875
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,750
Hello.

876
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,740
Hi.

877
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,090
I looked around the whole building.

878
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:01,990
The rooftop needs work.

879
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,690
Geu Rae.

880
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,100
Take the recruitment ad down.
Work is no fun for me now.

881
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,620
Take it down.

882
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,980
What are you doing?

883
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,320
We have procedures too!

884
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,940
We recruit properly!

885
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,620
Procedures?

886
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,600
You told us to be radical.

887
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,210
He got in through connections too.

888
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,940
Come on.

889
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,450
You let Geu Rae be radical and I can't?

890
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,720
Really?

891
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,940
Do it!

892
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,020
- No.
- Do it... please!

893
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,800
No, where are you going?

894
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,060
Don?t go, come here!

895
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,040
Glad you're here!

896
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,500
Get back to work!

897
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,440
Suh Jin Sang?

898
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,100
He took cell phone case samples

899
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,670
from the China factory and ran off.

900
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,360
What are you talking about?

901
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,610
You mean the metal cases 
we signed the contract for?

902
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:06,640
Yes.

903
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,260
- Where is he, can they find him?
- Can you find out where he is?

904
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,280
What this time?

905
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,710
We're searching now.

906
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,950
The China resident employee has 
gone to the Immigration Office.

907
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,320
I don't think it'll be hard to find him.

908
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,790
Ok, let me know ASAP.

909
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,790
I'm dumbfounded.

910
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:25,990
I can't believe he did this!

911
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,040
- This can ruin the contract.
- What should we do?

912
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,340
How many contracts does 
One International have?

913
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,300
Three, sir.

914
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,560
- What about us?
- Two, and one is under progress.

915
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,340
Yes.

916
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,070
With One International, it has to do 
with the buyer's credit and manpower,

917
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,410
it's a life-or-death issue for us.

918
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:43,140
I'll kill Jin Sang.

919
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,840
- Yeah.
 - He ran off to Jordan.

920
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,850
Jordan?

921
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,360
Ok, we'll take off right away too.

922
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,780
You can't delay the Vietnam 
case, right?

923
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,040
If we can't go tomorrow, the 
contract might be annulled.

924
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,920
Then Geu Rae will have to go.

925
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,660
- Get a visa and a plane ticket.
- Yes, sir.

926
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:59,900
Call Mr. Cho too.

927
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:00,980
Okay.

928
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,580
This is from Incheon to Abu Dabi.

929
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:13,120
This is from Abu Dabi to Amman.

930
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,820
Here's your passport and luggage ticket.

931
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,540
- Thank you.
- Have a good time.

932
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,210
Hello, sir.

933
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,140
I finished ticketing and will go in.

934
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,300
You know you need to 
transfer planes, right?

935
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,450
- Make sure you do that.
- Yes, I know.

936
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,950
Mr. Cho will be at Amman.

937
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,640
You know his number, right?

938
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,720
Yes, I know.

939
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,700
Ok, don't just eat anything.

940
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,880
Sir.

941
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,120
What?

942
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,660
I'm not a kid.

943
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,400
Ok.

944
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,720
Bye, sir.

945
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,740
Geu Rae.

946
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,320
Hello, sir.

947
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,720
You must be tired now.

948
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,900
I'm fine.

949
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,480
Where is Jin Sang now?

950
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,360
We know he's in Amman.

951
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,120
He's not in any of the 
hotels or guest houses.

952
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,700
I wonder where he is.

953
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,140
Any acquaintances?

954
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:25,080
He doesn't have any here.

955
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,980
Have you been to Jordan?

956
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,580
In the alleys,

957
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:34,880
there's a nice, cheap hotel.

958
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,500
It only costs $10 a day.

959
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,140
Have you checked hotels 
in the old districts?

960
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,690
- Hotels in the old districts?
- Yes.

961
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:46,960
There can't be any hotels there.

962
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,320
There are two or three, 
but I don't think so.

963
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,840
It's very old?

964
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,000
Yes.

965
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,540
- Old?
- And cheap.

966
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:56,600
Yes.

967
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,380
You can stay there for $10 a night.

968
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:05,180
I don?t think he would stay there.

969
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,740
No, please look into it.

970
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,100
Yes, sir.

971
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,260
But where's Mr. Oh?

972
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,340
Hi.

973
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,260
Where are you?

974
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,800
I'm looking at the land.

975
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,160
Land?

976
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,260
Come on.

977
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,160
You know why the Russian mafia 
has tattoos on their knees?

978
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,140
What?

979
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,160
It means they'll never kneel down.

980
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,280
What?

981
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,120
They never give up.

982
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,900
You should do whatever you can.

983
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,320
I see.

984
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,960
But that's too?

985
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,020
We always need a plan B.

986
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,960
This will determine our business' 
success, so be alert.

987
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,400
I heard building one doesn't take long.

988
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,340
This call is costing a lot, bye.

989
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,280
Hello?

990
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,960
See you three hours later in Petra.

991
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,020
What?
Why Petra?

992
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:35,340
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

993
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:40,000
And sorry I could not travel both

994
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,740
And be one traveler, long I stood

995
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,860
And looked down one as far as I could

996
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,970
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

997
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,560
Then took the other, as just as fair,

998
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,440
And having perhaps the better claim,

999
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,920
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

1000
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,500
Though as for that the passing there

1001
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,600
Had worn them really about the same,

1002
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,060
And both that morning equally

1003
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,060
leaves no step had trodden black.

1004
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:06,080
Oh, I kept the first for another day!

1005
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,100
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

1006
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,200
I doubted if I should ever come back.

1007
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,780
I shall be telling this with a sigh

1008
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:17,460
Somewhere ages and ages hence:

1009
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,440
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I?

1010
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,810
I took the one less traveled by,

1011
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:35,180
And that has made all the difference.

1012
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,800
Alcatraz.

1013
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,260
Pharaoh's treasure.

1014
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,940
The gateway to Petra.

1015
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,920
It's a path you have to pass by.

1016
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:27,230
It was the central trade route 
in the ancient times connecting

1017
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,760
the Persian Bay to the 
east, Red Sea to the south,

1018
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,320
and Mediterranean to the west.

1019
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,800
Incense road?

1020
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,420
Come to think of it,

1021
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,420
my dream as an 18-year-old

1022
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,960
was to travel around the world.

1023
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:01,720
As I watched Indiana Jones 3,

1024
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,600
I became determined.

1025
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:08,640
Indiana Jones 3?

1026
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,910
Mm-hmm.

1027
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,580
I had forgotten about it.

1028
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,720
But Jordan reminded me

1029
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,220
of my dream.

1030
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,900
Dream?

1031
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,930
As commerce decreased,

1032
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:36,780
Petra was forgotten for 
over 1,000 years.

1033
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,160
I see.

1034
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:44,380
So, I was thinking.

1035
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,700
Just because you forgot your dream

1036
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,020
doesn't make your dream vanish.

1037
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,760
Just because you can't see the

1038
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,340
road doesn't make the road vanish.

1039
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,740
Lu Xun said this.

1040
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:12,100
?Hope can't be said it exists,

1041
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,670
nor can it be said it's not exist.

1042
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:20,840
It is just like roads across the earth.

1043
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,010
For actually the earth had 
no roads to begin with,

1044
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:31,760
but when many men pass one 
way, a road is made.?

1045
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,920
I see.

1046
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,480
Uh, Mr. Oh.

1047
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,440
Yeah?

1048
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,170
Why did you want to meet here?

1049
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:53,210
I just told you.

1050
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:54,480
What?

1051
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,780
When?

1052
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,880
Just now.

1053
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,380
What?

1054
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,890
I just told you.

1055
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,020
What?

1056
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,620
I should've brought Young Yi.

1057
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:20,120
She would've gotten it right away.

1058
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,870
I should've brought Young Yi.

1059
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,980
Do you mean

1060
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,780
you want me to catch Jin Sang?

1061
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,840
Geu Rae.

1062
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,980
Did you find him?

1063
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,580
It's the Cairo Hotel.

1064
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,210
I'll see you in front of there.

1065
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,220
Geu Rae!

1066
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,240
Hi.

1067
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,200
Maybe he already checked out.

1068
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,070
Hello?

1069
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,420
Hello?

1070
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,200
Has the man who stayed in this 
room already checked out?

1071
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,200
His name is Mr. Suh.

1072
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:25,940
Mr. Suh Jin Sang.

1073
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,920
Mr. Suh Jin Sang!

1074
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,420
Mr. Suh Jin Sang!

1075
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,920
Geu Rae!

1076
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:06,810
I can't believe this.

1077
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,380
My, my neck.

1078
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:44,540
My ribs.

1079
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,820
I think I'm dying.

1080
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,740
Where are the items?

1081
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,760
Wha, what are you talking about?

1082
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,600
The samples you took 
from the China factory.

1083
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,400
What did I ta, take?

1084
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,840
Mr. Suh.

1085
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,870
If you just give back the items, 
we'll end it by firing you.

1086
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:08,520
- What?
- If you don't, we'll take legal actions.

1087
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,300
I mean you'll end up in jail.

1088
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,940
What do you me, mean?

1089
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,580
Are you crazy?

1090
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:18,780
Come on, must I go 
to jail on this trip?

1091
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:20,450
It's not in the room.

1092
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:21,940
You jerk!

1093
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:26,260
Let go, it hurts, I'll kill you guys.

1094
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:29,700
I'll call the embassy 
about this diplomatic issue.

1095
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:32,660
You have proof?

1096
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,090
We have no choice.

1097
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:51,680
Where are we?

1098
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,040
Wadi Rum.

1099
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,220
What?

1100
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,320
Wadi Rum?

1101
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,900
Thank you.

1102
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,680
It's cold out there.

1103
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,460
Let me repeat myself.

1104
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:45,860
If you just give back the items, 
we'll end it by firing you.

1105
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:48,400
I really don?t know.

1106
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,860
Come on, and Geu Rae, who 
are you to threaten me?

1107
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:55,010
Do I work for your company?

1108
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:57,200
Am I Korean?

1109
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,200
Geez.

1110
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,860
Mr. Oh.

1111
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:17,880
We caught him, but he won't tell us.

1112
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,020
We don't have a choice 
either without evidence.

1113
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,880
- Geu Rae.
- What?

1114
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,900
Russia

1115
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,570
mafia's knee tattoo?

1116
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,070
Come on.

1117
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:30,540
Ok.

1118
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:34,260
I swear I didn?t take the samples.

1119
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,380
They're looking for you 
in Basilisk, Russia too.

1120
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:42,360
Mr. Cho, what's the share of 
the Russian mafia for Basilisk?

1121
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,520
What?

1122
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,940
Mr. Oh said it's about 70%.

1123
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,780
Isn't that absurd?

1124
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,760
Right, I heard they'd been

1125
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,260
sponsoring for a few years.

1126
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:59,460
Already 70%?

1127
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:05,160
Then that's a mafia's company.

1128
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,920
Mr. Suh.

1129
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,640
Mr. Oh told me to tell you something.

1130
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,520
What's that?

1131
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:20,340
In Russia, the fist is more 
influential than the law.

1132
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:24,590
Why would he say that to me?

1133
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,580
Let's wrap up.

1134
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:39,040
The fist is more 
influential than the law.

1135
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,840
Just tell me where it is.

1136
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:02,760
Then there won't be any problems.

1137
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,160
Geu Rae, Amman Airport.

1138
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,300
In a locker at Amman Airport.

1139
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,670
No. 20, I'm sorry.

1140
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:14,120
I'm really sorry,

1141
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:17,420
please let me go.

1142
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:22,480
Geu Rae, you're a true 
One International employee.

1143
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:29,860
Who did you call a One 
International employee?

1144
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:36,020
Why is he a One International employee?

1145
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,740
It's just an analogy.

1146
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:42,320
He worked so hard so that One 
International wouldn't suffer a loss.

1147
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,220
You mean our company, 
not One International!

1148
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,860
That's the same thing.

1149
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:50,620
One International's loss is 
your loss, and your loss?

1150
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,900
Be quiet!

1151
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,380
Don't you know our motto?

1152
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:55,400
You can steal our business, 
but not our people.

1153
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,680
I heard it's your bad luck.

1154
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,520
Dong Sik?

1155
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,200
You're bad.

1156
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,980
I'm not bad.

1157
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,060
- Geu Rae.
- Yes.

1158
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,100
Why didn't you say anything when he 
called you a One International employee?

1159
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,660
What?

1160
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,540
You still miss it?

1161
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:51,020
No.

1162
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,740
Before, you said you only needed 
some insurance and gosh?

1163
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,040
Now that a year has gone by,

1164
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,080
you want more pay and benefits, right?

1165
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:05,180
I know, please increase my pay.

1166
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,600
What?

1167
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,160
You really miss One International?

1168
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,100
I don?t know.

1169
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,980
Why, you?

1170
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,580
Captivate me, sir.

1171
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:27,680
What?

1172
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,280
Just captivate me.

1173
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:33,340
What do you have that you can sell?

1174
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,380
What do you have that you can sell?

1175
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,650
My effort.

1176
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:40,310
I've never used my effort,

1177
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:42,940
so it's like brand new.

1178
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,820
Brand new?

1179
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,650
I'll work hard.

1180
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:48,650
I'll do whatever it takes.

1181
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:51,140
Drive, man.

1182
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,960
I had an accident, don't hit me.

1183
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,500
A road opens

1184
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,320
as you tread along it.

1185
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,300
A road that doesn't

1186
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,640
open isn't a road.

1187
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,660
Roads are open to everyone.

1188
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,420
But not everyone 
can have the roads.

1189
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:14,260
This isn't the army for 
you to get proficiency pay.

1190
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,580
You told me to catch me.

1191
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,160
I risked my life and caught him.

1192
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,480
This is wrong.

1193
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,320
Another road has opened.

1194
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,800
And I'm not alone.

1195
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:53,650
[Misaeng]

1196
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,760

1197
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:26,710
