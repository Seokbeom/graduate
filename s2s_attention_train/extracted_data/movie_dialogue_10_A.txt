 Big question that lad Why what ? <eos>
 If the horn be restored the curse is ended <eos>
 No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm <eos>
 You do the praying I ve work ahead <eos>
 Better we eat him than the other way round <eos>
 Something s coming <eos>
 It would appear so <eos>
 Careful lad <eos>
 Aye ! That too <eos>
 You will need more than bird droppings for Blackheart <eos>
 I will drop a cow on the knave ! <eos>
 Whatever for ? <eos>
 Jenny Greenteeth said Follow the raven in her flight <eos>
 Blackheart ? <eos>
 The foulest Mayhap I can cut them free <eos>
 Jack don t ! <eos>
 What know you of fields of war ? <eos>
 Beyond Devil s Needle all is unknown <eos>
 Nay Jack tis not what you are thinking <eos>
 I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable <eos>
 Something the matter ? <eos>
 Ogg s footprints ! <eos>
 Certainly understandable <eos>
 Gump you are putting words in my mouth <eos>
 There s the way mates <eos>
 It bodes evil <eos>
 Willful creature that one <eos>
 Easily said the raven passed this way hours ago <eos>
 Heading true north We continue in that direction <eos>
 Aye lad we ve little else to go by <eos>
 We will never find the Baron s castle <eos>
 Nay This time we strike first ! <eos>
 Nay I show no pity to imps and fiends <eos>
 I know the rogue Jack Tis Jimmy Squarefoot <eos>
 No but what choice have we ? <eos>
 The chill is worse this night <eos>
 It feels wrong Jack like a trap <eos>
 Easily spoken <eos>

 What magic have we on our side ? <eos>
 That s it ! <eos>
 Aye Before the wee pesties attacked <eos>
 Then it s Godspeed Screwball <eos>

 Liar ! <eos>
 Or perchance <eos>
 Oh fie What about the unicorn ? <eos>
 Unicorn ? <eos>
 A promise is a sacred oath <eos>

 A gentleman would offer water <eos>
 Be patient <eos>

 They rival the angels of paradise <eos>
 Jack ! <eos>
 To fetch your napkin <eos>
 I don t know They ve hurt the unicorn <eos>
 Who ? <eos>

 My own father <eos>
 How bad was the unicorn s wound ? <eos>
 Oh yes and the mare with him <eos>
 Its powers are strong <eos>
 Jack Green Jack you mustn t flatter me so <eos>
 Tis the truth <eos>
 Nay Jack I am but wary of your intentions <eos>
 Be it fit for your wife Green Jack ? <eos>
 I have no wife <eos>
 Then perchance you will me <eos>
 If wishes were horses even beggars would ride <eos>
 Jack Forgive me <eos>
 Only what s right <eos>
 I was bewitched it s better this way <eos>
 They told me you were dead <eos>
 You ve freed me Jack <eos>
 Sunlight It destroys him <eos>
 Sunlight ? <eos>
 That s why he goes masked during the day <eos>
 So he s hiding in the dark <eos>
 In the dark where I join him <eos>
 You are teasing still <eos>
 And I love you my husband <eos>
 Ouch ! Something s biting me <eos>
 Biting you ? <eos>
 Pinching me ! <eos>
 Pinching ? Where ? <eos>
 Everywhere ! Ow ! <eos>

 Princess ? I know of no princess <eos>
 Exceeding fair <eos>
 As fair as me ? <eos>

 As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom <eos>
 I pray God grants it me <eos>
 Sorry <eos>
 Only that ? <eos>
 And charmed of course <eos>
 Do I not please you Jack ? <eos>
 In every way <eos>
 And am I not fair ? <eos>
 Wondrously so <eos>
