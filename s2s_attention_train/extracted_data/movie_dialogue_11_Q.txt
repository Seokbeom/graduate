 A factor of age . <eos>
 I hope I never get that old . <eos>
 I see . <eos>

 You are a very perceptive young woman . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 That would be difficult to explain . <eos>
 That s why Smith called you MacLeod . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He knows about you . <eos>
 That s insane . <eos>
 Perhaps . There s something more . An inheritance . <eos>
 Of bodies . <eos>
 I did not kill the watchman . <eos>
 You killed those other two . <eos>
 Not the same . <eos>
 What about that family in 31 ? <eos>
 There are differences . <eos>

 I have not killed you . <eos>
 Do not . <eos>
 Come here Brenna . <eos>

 At your service Count . <eos>
 Madeleine <eos>
 Do not say that reading s my salvation . <eos>
 Do not turn us out Abbe . <eos>
 By whom ? The Marquis ? <eos>
 Go back to your room . Quickly . <eos>
 What ? What have I done ? <eos>

 Free his mouth . <eos>
 Must not do that sir . <eos>
 Care for a splash of wine Abbe ? <eos>
 Enough to discern its tenor . <eos>
 They can not be serious . <eos>
 Our future lies in the stroke of your pen . <eos>
 You mean to take us all down with you ? <eos>
 He can not do that to me . <eos>
 I have a proposition . <eos>
 Part the gates of heaven as it were <eos>
 Good day Marquis . <eos>
 water ! <eos>
 WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE ? <eos>
 What on earth would that require ? <eos>
 A night spent with the partner of my choice . <eos>
 You expect me to pimp Madeleine ? <eos>
 OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES ! <eos>
 Coulmier you animal ! <eos>
 Oh I am to be blamed now am I ? <eos>
 It s no secret that you loved her . <eos>
 Oh that s rich coming from her lapdog <eos>
 I saw the longing in your eye <eos>
 that was lust <eos>
 Do not confuse one organ with another <eos>
 I know because I felt it myself <eos>
 I WANTED TO FUCK HER THAT S ALL ! <eos>
 AND DID YOU ? <eos>
 Go to hell ! <eos>
 Why was it you never took her by force ? <eos>
 Who s to say I did not ? <eos>
 Was it impotence ? <eos>
 NEVER ! <eos>
 Abbe de Coulmier ! <eos>
 I am here . <eos>
 Surely you will grant me a final word . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 His wife s influence . <eos>
 Oh . That . <eos>

 Madame Bougival Mademoiselle Clairwil and of course the Marquis wife <eos>
 It was fiction of course . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It was not inspired by circumstance . <eos>
 If only blood will appease you then shed mine . <eos>
 My my . You have exceeded my expectations . <eos>
 And my own . <eos>
 How s the patient faring ? <eos>
 Poorly . <eos>
 I will be waiting . <eos>
 You asked my name once it s Madeleine . <eos>

 I am hungry for a proper visit . <eos>
 If only these coins purchased your other talents too . <eos>
 Is it awfully violent ? <eos>
 Most assuredly . <eos>
 Is it terribly erotic ? <eos>
 The story s thrilling conclusion comes at a premium . <eos>
 Yes ! You shall . Of course you shall <eos>
 You would do that rather than forsake our love ? <eos>
 It s tainted money Doctor . <eos>
 What a beautiful thought Marquise . <eos>
 Oh but I am ! <eos>

 Who knew about Agnes pregnancy ? <eos>
 No one . <eos>
 How did she hide it from the other nuns ? <eos>
 She undressed alone . she bathed alone . <eos>
 Is that normal ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Who was the father ? <eos>
 I have not a clue . <eos>
 What man had access to her ? <eos>
 None as far as I know . <eos>
 Was there a priest ? <eos>
 Yes but I . <eos>
 Could there have been anyone else ? <eos>
 Obviously there was . <eos>
 What s your opinion ? <eos>
 So someone else could have done it . <eos>
 No . not in the eyes of the police . <eos>
 And in your eyes ? <eos>
 It s possible s not it ? <eos>
 That s absurd ! <eos>
 Shortly after she came to us . <eos>
 And you were not shocked ? <eos>
 I was appalled just as you are now . <eos>
 And what happened ? <eos>
 This was before her pregnancy ? <eos>
 You hate us do not you ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Nuns . you hate nuns . <eos>
 I hate ignorance and stupidity . <eos>
 Then help her . <eos>
 There s another choice . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Aquittal . <eos>
 All right what do you need . <eos>
 When would Agnes have conceived the child ? <eos>
 Oh some time in January . <eos>
 Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time ? <eos>
 Earthquakes ? <eos>
 Visitors to the convent . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 There s nothing here . <eos>
 Was the child full term ? <eos>
 Oh Dear God . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 The sheets . <eos>
 What sheets ? <eos>
 You lied to me <eos>
 About what ? <eos>
 Like keeping her home from school ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Do you know what she did to her ? <eos>
 I do not think I care to know . <eos>
 She molested her ! <eos>
 I knew that after the fact . <eos>
 Why did not you do anything to stop her ? <eos>
 Because I did not know . <eos>
 And my permission ? <eos>
 We will see about that . <eos>
 Do not deny it ! <eos>
 I have not decided yet . <eos>
 The woman s health s at stake . <eos>
 Because I am a moral person . <eos>
 Bullshit ! <eos>
 Bullshit yourself ! <eos>
 Catholic Church does not have a corner on morality . <eos>
 Who said anything about the Catholic Church . <eos>
 No it reminds me . <eos>
 Would you like one ? Huh ? <eos>

 Yes I do . <eos>
 Do you want to become one ? <eos>
 Do you think Agnes s still attached to God ? <eos>
 Listen to her singing . <eos>
 I would like to begin . <eos>
 Begin what ? <eos>
 The hypnotism . Do you still disapprove ? <eos>
 Would it stop you if I did ? <eos>
 May I be present ? <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 For the Church ? <eos>
 For Agnes . <eos>
 You think she s a saint ? <eos>
 The father ! <eos>
 Who s he ? <eos>
 Why must he be anybody ? <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 Do not be ridiculous . <eos>
 Oh would you stop lying Mother ! <eos>
 I am concerned about her health . <eos>
 This s permission to take her apart . <eos>
 Where s she ? <eos>
 Has not she had enough ? <eos>
 I have a few more questions to ask her . <eos>
 Who knew she was pregnant ? <eos>
 Why do you insist upon pressing . <eos>
 Was it you ? <eos>
 Is it because she s a nun ? <eos>
 Did you know she was pregnant ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And you did not send her to a doctor . <eos>
 I did not guess until it was too late . <eos>
 For what ? An abortion ? <eos>
 Oh do not be ridiculous . <eos>
 The baby ? <eos>
 She did not want any help . <eos>
 You wanted that child out of the way . <eos>
 That s a lie . <eos>
 And the baby . <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 I doubt that s what she would say . <eos>
 That s enough . <eos>
 Agnes what happened to the baby ? <eos>
 She can not remember . <eos>

 I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty . <eos>
 What do you know about the Highlands ? <eos>

 Do you hunt ? <eos>
 Occasionally . <eos>
 Dare say you can be taught . <eos>
 To shoot perhaps but not to kill . <eos>
 I am fine . <eos>

 For Her Majesty . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 But yourself ? What about John Brown ? <eos>
 I said . I serve the Queen . <eos>
 They do not see it . <eos>
 They are not as watchful as you . <eos>
 Too busy looking after themselves . <eos>
 The greasy pole . <eos>
 No loyalty . <eos>
 She will never understand it . <eos>
 In time she will . <eos>
