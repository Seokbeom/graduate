 Where did I stop ? <eos>
 The end of the Recordare Statuens in parte dextra . <eos>
 Consigned to flames of woe . <eos>
 Do you believe in it ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 A fire which never dies . Burning one forever ? <eos>
 Oh yes . <eos>

 Because His Majesty wishes it . <eos>
 Is the Emperor angry with me ? <eos>
 On the contrary . <eos>
 Mozart you are not the only composer in Vienna . <eos>

 A little modesty would suit you better . <eos>
 Who s on this committee ? <eos>
 Kapellmeister Bonno Count Orsini Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri . <eos>
 Well done Mozart . Really quite fine . <eos>
 Baron ! <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 In the sight of God that s a sin . <eos>

 Do you understand that you have sinned ? Gravely . <eos>
 Leave me alone . <eos>
 I cannot leave alone a soul in pain . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Here in Vienna . <eos>
 Then you must know this . <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 I regret it s not too familiar . <eos>
 Ah you have heard that ? <eos>
 All Vienna has heard that . <eos>
 And do they believe it ? <eos>
 Is it true ? <eos>
 Do you believe it ? <eos>
 Should I ? <eos>
 Do you hear me ? <eos>
 He was murdered Father ! Mozart ! Cruelly murdered . <eos>
 Did you try ? <eos>
 Every day . Sometimes for hours I would pray ! <eos>
 You cannot say that ! <eos>
 No ? Was Mozart a good man ? <eos>
 I did . <eos>
 No you did not ! <eos>
 I poisoned his life . <eos>
 But not his body . <eos>
 What difference does that make ? <eos>
 You mean that play ? <eos>

 You must be mad . <eos>
 Are you absolutely sure ? <eos>

 The Institute . the funding . <eos>
 A cover . for us . I am sorry . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 Quite frankly . it could have been you . <eos>
 About your next assignment Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Next assignment ? <eos>
 Ahem . As I was saying perhaps another macaroon . <eos>
 Thank you Steed . <eos>
 Good luck . Peter . Emma . <eos>
 Thanks Valentine . <eos>
 Dr . Darling Peter . all you . <eos>
 An unholy trinity . <eos>
 You killed my husband . <eos>
 Of course . I planned that too . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 Our revels now are ended . <eos>
 Oh no Emma . They have only just begun . <eos>
 Think of this as your second wedding feast . <eos>
 I am already married . <eos>
 You know I believe she s actually jealous . <eos>
 Valentine listen to me . <eos>
 What are my choices ? <eos>
 Choices ? <eos>
 I will never marry you . <eos>
 I was about to throw in the towel . <eos>
 I had a spot of bother at the door . <eos>
 I did not . Mother did . <eos>
 Mother ? <eos>
 My father always wanted a boy . <eos>
 Really ? I fail to see the connection . <eos>
 I had a feeling you would . Touche ! <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 Yes indeed . I need protection . <eos>
 You can but I wish you would not . <eos>
 Thank you Trubshaw . <eos>
 That place s so absurd so out of date . <eos>
 Do you really think so ? <eos>
 As per mother s instructions . <eos>
 Do we always follow Mother s instructions ? <eos>
 For a man in my position <eos>
 No thanks . <eos>
 I meant me . <eos>
 June July . August ? <eos>
 The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined . <eos>
 Any other vices ? <eos>
 Ah Brenda . Mrs . Peel ? <eos>
 You should be dead . How do you feel ? <eos>
 Strange . <eos>
 An invitation . To a formal picnic . <eos>
 Did you say formal ? I must dress . <eos>
 I must say you look more your old self <eos>
 You mean my other self . <eos>
 What on earth ? <eos>
 Any ideas ? <eos>
 Is that written in his shoe ? <eos>
 Common knowledge Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 She had this in her mouth . There there . <eos>
 But <eos>
 Do not bother . Here s a bus . <eos>
 Not quite . This s my field . <eos>
 Is there anything that s not ? <eos>
 But if someone miniaturized the process . <eos>
 That s what we were working on . <eos>
 Sounds as if someone s hijacked your research . <eos>
 Three agents killed by bad weather . <eos>
 . And by you Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Is that what you think ? <eos>
 Oh well . Just my type Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 What Lady Disdain ? Are you yet breathing ? <eos>
 Barely . <eos>
 Steed . ! <eos>
 Mrs . Peel . ? <eos>
 You followed me . <eos>
 Orders . <eos>
 To kill me ? <eos>
 Nothing personal . <eos>
 I could save you the trouble . <eos>
 No trouble . <eos>
 Because you always obey orders . <eos>
 Always . Except . <eos>
 Mmm . what are you doing ? <eos>
 Keeping a stiff upper lip ? <eos>
 Is that all ? <eos>
 But you did suspect me . <eos>
 Not for a moment . <eos>
 You are playing games . <eos>
 Are not we all Mrs . Peel ? <eos>
 I thought you played by the rules . <eos>
 I thought you did not . <eos>
 I am playing to win . <eos>
 Winning s not everything . <eos>
 No after you . <eos>
 You do not trust me ? <eos>
 As far as you trust me . <eos>
 I told Mother I took care of you . <eos>
 You lied . <eos>
 No idea who . No idea why . <eos>
 Teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys All children s things . <eos>
 His name s Jones . Invisible Jones . <eos>
 Why s he called Invisible ? <eos>
 You will find out . <eos>
 We must hurry Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Hurry ? What for ? I am just now <eos>
 You did not tell her ? <eos>
 What s that you are wearing ? <eos>
 It s called Black Leather . <eos>
 Intoxicating . Here have one of these . <eos>
 You first . <eos>
 Shall we ? <eos>
 Trubshaw again ? What now ? <eos>
 Snuff . I must insist you try some . <eos>
 I will be back . <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>
 Mrs . Peel ? <eos>
 What kept you ? <eos>
 The plot . Hello we must be going . <eos>
 The owl and the pussycat went to sea <eos>
 . in a beautiful pea green boat . <eos>
 A fine night Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Still a bit chilly . <eos>
 Have you any place in mind ? <eos>
 As a matter of fact I have . <eos>
 I do not recall Siberia being this warm Steed . <eos>
 It s the latest thing Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Our little paradise just made for two ? <eos>

 Steed <eos>
 How did you guess ? <eos>
 You reek of Mrs . Peel s Black Leather . <eos>

 Brenda and I thought we would drop in . <eos>
 Amnesia ? <eos>
 Possibly . Split personality . <eos>
 Insane . ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 She may try to kill you . <eos>
 Anyone particular in mind ? <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Guilty until proven innocent ? <eos>

 To explode of course . <eos>

 You intend sorting this out tonight ? <eos>
 Very good indeed . <eos>
 We have hunted since childhood . <eos>
 I do not suppose I could watch . <eos>
 Might be exciting for you . <eos>
 Shhh . <eos>
 I am sure you mean that to be comforting but <eos>
 you will have to deal with it Nigel . <eos>
 . one shot . <eos>
 So that s what a lion looks like . <eos>
 John it will not be easy . <eos>
 Nigel you will just have to use your hands <eos>
 But you said they were always old . <eos>
 That s what the books say . <eos>
 What a good week . <eos>
 You mean nobody died ? <eos>
 I did not have a chance to thank you . <eos>
 What did I do ? <eos>
 Got me out of trouble . <eos>
 Nonsense Samuel would have done something . <eos>
 We need to talk . <eos>
 That s very considerate . <eos>
 I am always considerate my mother taught me that . <eos>
 I can try . <eos>
 Samuel says you killed a lion . <eos>
 . misfire . it jammed . <eos>
 Has it ever done that before ? <eos>
 . do not know . <eos>
 Think about something else . <eos>
 Have you ever failed ? <eos>
 Only in life . <eos>
 What happened to them ? <eos>
 I got big . <eos>
 You think they will come then ? Why ? <eos>
 Good luck . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because I think they are after you . <eos>
 Did it look like this in your mind ? <eos>
 This s more difficult <eos>
 I am also liaison between these two . <eos>
 Clearly you do not agree about building the railroad ? <eos>
 What are they looking at ? <eos>
 You they cannot believe you are still here . <eos>
 Nonsense . <eos>

 Once . <eos>
 Where s it ? <eos>
 Underneath . Somewhere . <eos>
 Afraid of lions . <eos>
 It s all right Samuel we all get hit <eos>
 How many cattle ? <eos>
 Four should do it . <eos>
 They will want a lot of money . <eos>
 Did you ever see a lion that size ? <eos>
 Not even close . What happened ? <eos>
 Some mysteries should not have solutions . <eos>
 Hold your son high . <eos>

 Then you would be out of a job . <eos>
 Gladly Caesar . <eos>
 Caesar ? <eos>
 That this illness has clouded his mind . <eos>
 They wo not break this one . <eos>
 Apparently my opinion was not needed . <eos>
 Maybe it will crush Gaius . <eos>

 Marcus Aurelius has died . <eos>
 He left us at dawn . <eos>
 Where s my father ? <eos>
 Where s the emperor and the army soldier ? <eos>
 Yes Caesar ? <eos>
 Jerses tomorrow . <eos>
 I have read of it . <eos>
 But have never been ? <eos>
 The trouble s defining exactly what right is . <eos>
 We all know what right s Senator . <eos>
 Why you ? <eos>
 My loyalties . were in doubt . <eos>
 You cannot die . <eos>
 Would that Marcus had lived . <eos>
 The Senators admire you . <eos>
 They fear me . <eos>
 Tomorrow ? <eos>
 As soon as I can . <eos>
 On your honor as a Roman officer daddy ? <eos>
 On my honor as your daddy . <eos>
 My troops do not make policy . <eos>

 He s very realistic . <eos>
 Is not the helmet magnificent ? <eos>
 Greeks ? <eos>
 Athenians . <eos>
 What about their philosophy lessons ? <eos>
 They are studying with Cynics . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 You need to come home ! <eos>

 I never knew a more idealistic man than you . <eos>
 Take your hands off me animal ! <eos>
 Chain him . <eos>
 I refuse to be your slave . I refuse <eos>
 to fight ? We will see . <eos>
 General do you realize what happened out there today ? <eos>
 I did not get killed and everyone else did . <eos>
 That s one way to look at it . <eos>
 You get to come alive again in the country ! <eos>

 She left . She s gone . <eos>
 What do you mean ? Where did she go ? <eos>
 You know that s not what s upsetting me . <eos>
 Well it fucking should be should not it ? <eos>
 I knew this was going to happen . <eos>
 Then what are you getting so upset about ? <eos>
 What do you think ? <eos>
 It s the best collection I have ever seen . <eos>
 Give me fifty bucks and they are all yours . <eos>
 But you must have <eos>
 I must have nothing . Their my husband s . <eos>
 Sixty . <eos>
 Thirteen hundred . <eos>
 Seventy five . <eos>
 Eleven hundred . That s my lowest offer . <eos>
 And I wo not take a penny over ninety . <eos>
 Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you ? <eos>
 Sure . Ten cents . <eos>
 I think you have more . <eos>
 Well we do not . <eos>
 I can not frisk you but the cops can . <eos>
 Records are those big round black things right ? <eos>
 Fuck off . <eos>
 We are not there yet Justin . <eos>
 I am Vince . <eos>
 Whatever . <eos>
 Nice . <eos>
 What s the name of your label ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 He would want to know about all this . <eos>
 I warned you . <eos>
 Go to hell . <eos>
 Does not have a head does he ? <eos>
 This one came unassembled . <eos>
 Did not think it was my buddy over there . <eos>
 Figured you knew more about swords than I did . <eos>
 Claymore . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 You are the expert . <eos>
 It s in good condition . <eos>
 You are very macabre . <eos>
 It s my birthday . <eos>
 Happy birthday . <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 Would you like more tea ? <eos>
 No thank you I am fine . <eos>
 He was unsual . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Then you did not know Richard later on . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Would you remember his name ? <eos>
 Carl Smith . <eos>
 Okay okay . <eos>
 You owe me . Besides I am cute . <eos>
 Church Hill that s pretty close s not it ? <eos>
 Anything in Maryland s close . <eos>
 Do you play ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Very traditional . <eos>
 I would like to ask you about the claymore . <eos>
 It s not mine . <eos>
 Byzantine ? <eos>
 Basil the II . <eos>
 Good reflexes . <eos>
 Good day Miss Cartwright . <eos>
 Grave robbers ? <eos>
 Probably . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 People like that rarely leave business cards . <eos>
 Does Carl Smith ? <eos>
 You have an active imagination . <eos>
 I have been to Church Hill . <eos>
 I have friends . <eos>
 I doubt that . Good day Miss Cartwright . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Tradition . <eos>
 What the hell s going on ? <eos>
 He tried to kill me last night . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Dupont Circle . <eos>
 Who s he ? <eos>
 At the moment ? Carl Smith . <eos>
 And you ? <eos>
 He called you MacLeod . <eos>
 Not your concern . <eos>
 That bothers you ? <eos>
 He was innocent . <eos>
 What about me ? <eos>
 You ? <eos>
 Have you gone to the police ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I would rather hear yours . <eos>
 You are being foolish . <eos>
 He sees me as a threat . <eos>
 Are you ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 No one knows you are here ? <eos>
 No . I had to talk to you . <eos>
 You had to do nothing ! <eos>
 You are wrong . <eos>
 You are a fool . <eos>
 Maybe . <eos>
 Is this what you killed them with ? <eos>
 You have been listening to rumors . <eos>
 You did kill those men . <eos>
 Not all of them . <eos>
 When you finish what then ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I wish I could . <eos>
 No . So what now ? We just wait ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Well as long as we are stuck here . <eos>
 It s beautiful . <eos>
 A little dusty . <eos>
 William Taupin seems to have left his mark . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And you are William Taupin are not you ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Then you must be at least 70 years old . <eos>
 At least . <eos>
 That s impossible . <eos>
 A factor of age . <eos>
 I hope I never get that old . <eos>
 You wo not . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 I am not even sure why . <eos>
 Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer . <eos>
 You are a very perceptive young woman . <eos>
 Just a little crazy . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 That would be difficult to explain . <eos>
 I would like you to try . <eos>
 That s why Smith called you MacLeod . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He knows about you . <eos>
 He s older than I . <eos>
 That s insane . <eos>
 Perhaps . There s something more . An inheritance . <eos>
 Of bodies . <eos>
 I did not kill the watchman . <eos>
 You killed those other two . <eos>
 Not the same . <eos>
 What about that family in 31 ? <eos>
 Sometimes innocents become involved . <eos>
 There are differences . <eos>
 You kill with your left hand ? <eos>
 I have not killed you . <eos>
 Is that a threat ? <eos>
 Do not . <eos>
 Come here Brenna . <eos>
 Damn you . <eos>
 What s it you want ? <eos>
 All of it finished . <eos>
 Get out . <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 The inheritance . <eos>
 Not power . Not control . <eos>
 Forget it . <eos>

 Nice meeting you . <eos>

 We are not sure . <eos>
 What do you think he did ? <eos>
 I am busy right now . <eos>
 It s important . <eos>
 Each of those grids represents almost a square mile . <eos>
 That s a big area to cover . <eos>
 What time did he get there ? <eos>
 About a quarter to one . <eos>
 We can not rely on your judgement anymore . <eos>
 What does that mean ? <eos>
 The most logical choice . <eos>
 You do not have a shred of evidence ! <eos>
 Ten days ago . <eos>
 Do you know how she found the apartment ? <eos>
 Through a rental agency . <eos>
 Could you tell me where you were last night ? <eos>
 Here . I played Gregory Lutz . <eos>
 Another one ? What word did he leave ? <eos>
 Is . Did you tell him about the institute ? <eos>
 Where were you last night ? <eos>
 Are we going to go through this again ? <eos>
 Answer the question . <eos>
 I went out . <eos>
 Jeremy would have never killed himself . <eos>
 Maybe he just got tired of covering for you . <eos>
 He knows you are aware of that . <eos>
 Then I will transpose . <eos>
 It s a good play but risky . <eos>
 You do not win by playing it safe Peter . <eos>
 You are always in the middle of a match . <eos>
 I want to be the best I can . <eos>
 You have something you want to say ? <eos>
 Just thought you might want to talk . <eos>
 About what ? <eos>

 Yes . <eos>
 When I was very young . <eos>
 It seems like such a complicated game . <eos>
 It is . <eos>
 Do you always open quickly ? <eos>
 Are we talking about me or chess ? <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Each circumstance requires a different tactic . <eos>
 Well I think I have had enough . <eos>
 Getting too hot in here for you ? <eos>
 What are you looking for ? <eos>
 Nothing . I just came in for a steam . <eos>
 No you did not . <eos>
 She could be dead after the game . <eos>
 She could be dead now . <eos>
 You sure you do not want to eat something ? <eos>
 I do not think I could . <eos>
 You sound like my mother . <eos>
 It was not intentional . <eos>
 I think it s interesting . <eos>
 Another kind of game ? <eos>
 In a way . <eos>
 This s not a game . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 Let s change the subject . <eos>
 You mean like in the steam room ? <eos>
 That s not fair ! <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because I work with them . <eos>
 No . <eos>

 My generosity s not so large as that . <eos>
 What do you want with me ? <eos>
 Your love . <eos>
 Your words sting more sharply than your whip . <eos>
 But I am hideous ! <eos>
 You are magnificent . <eos>
 Grotesque . monstrous . <eos>
 God protect me . <eos>
 Not from me surely . <eos>
 You . you are a beast ! <eos>
 And you . are you not also afraid ? <eos>
 I am afraid of nothing . <eos>
 Like some vile toadstool . <eos>
 I prefer to think more like the sagacious owl . <eos>
 Do you feed on mice and rats ? <eos>
 Why have you brought me here ? <eos>
 To be my bride of course . <eos>
 I would soon die . <eos>
 Damn you ! <eos>
 We are both of us damned my beauty . <eos>
 Sweet Princess you begin to sound most reasonable . <eos>
 What do you want from me ? <eos>
 And then ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 What will become of me then ? <eos>
 I did not know . I <eos>
 What ? Speakee loud ! No hear velly good . <eos>
 Flozen foleva not good . <eos>
 It s terrible . <eos>
 You come stealee tleasoo ? <eos>
 Oh no . Do not you understand ? <eos>
 Faerie ring ? <eos>
 To be sure . <eos>
 It s bluebells ! <eos>
 What ! <eos>
 But . but why ? <eos>
 Big question that lad . Why what ? <eos>
 Aye . Black Baron s mischief . <eos>
 If the horn be restored the curse s ended . <eos>
 And who might that be ? <eos>
 No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm . <eos>
 Better pray the worm s a sound sleeper Jack . <eos>
 You do the praying . I have work ahead . <eos>
 There be no finer victuals than worm flesh lad . <eos>
 Better we eat him than the other way round . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Something s coming . <eos>
 Pregnant s she ? <eos>
 It would appear so . <eos>
 Damn them ! <eos>
 Careful lad . <eos>
 Save your mischief for the Black Baron . <eos>
 Aye ! That too . <eos>
 You will need more than bird droppings for Blackheart . <eos>
 I will drop a cow on the knave ! <eos>
 We must follow that bird . <eos>
 Whatever for ? <eos>
 Jenny Greenteeth said Follow the raven in her flight . <eos>
 This s ogre s magic . <eos>
 Blackheart ? <eos>
 Foul fellow this Couer de Noir . <eos>
 The foulest . Mayhap I can cut them free . <eos>
 Jack do not ! <eos>
 Worse than the battlefield . <eos>
 What know you of fields of war ? <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 Beyond Devil s Needle all s unknown . <eos>
 Twould appear other travelers precede us . <eos>
 Nay Jack tis not what you are thinking . <eos>
 I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable . <eos>
 My God ! Look ! <eos>
 Something the matter ? <eos>
 Ogg s footprints ! <eos>
 Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet . <eos>
 Certainly understandable . <eos>
 I should hope not ! <eos>
 Gump you are putting words in my mouth . <eos>
 God s blessing . <eos>
 There s the way mates . <eos>
 What make ye of that Jack ? <eos>
 It bodes evil . <eos>
 Wait ! <eos>
 Willful creature that one . <eos>
 Long as we do not lose heart Jack . <eos>
 We will never find the Baron s castle . <eos>
 Wait Jack . <eos>
 Nay . This time we strike first ! <eos>
 Can we trust him ? <eos>
 No . but what choice have we ? <eos>
 Never felt so cold in all me born days . <eos>
 The chill s worse this night . <eos>
 Give in to despair and all s lost . <eos>
 It feels wrong Jack . like a trap . <eos>
 Defend ourselves . We have bested far worse already . <eos>
 Easily spoken . <eos>
 There s not much time ! <eos>
 Been telling you that all along lad . <eos>
 What magic have we on our side ? <eos>
 One more turn . <eos>
 That s it ! <eos>
 Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory ? <eos>
 Aye . Before the wee pesties attacked . <eos>
 Then it s Godspeed Screwball . <eos>
 Fire away ! <eos>
 He will be atop the portculis ere long . <eos>
 Best get down close to the moat lad . <eos>
 Aye . We are good as inside . <eos>
 It s what we will find there worries me . <eos>
 It does not matter . <eos>
 Nonsense ! Course it matters . <eos>
 . the Princess Lili . I have killed her . <eos>
 Sunlight you say ? <eos>
 Aye . Hurry now Gump the key ! <eos>
 Mean you to seek him out below ? <eos>
 I am not afraid of the dark . <eos>
 What weapon ? <eos>
 Sunlight . <eos>
 Plan on carrying some away in a kettle ? <eos>
 Will you explain what s going on ? <eos>
 Patience lad . <eos>
 Do not get too far ! <eos>
 Hurry up ! <eos>
 Never show mercy ! <eos>
 I could have struck off his head just now ! <eos>
 Ride like wild fire Jack . <eos>
 He will not escape me . <eos>
 A good day for singing . <eos>
 I have not heard a note out of you . <eos>
 Not in the mood I am afraid . <eos>
 Listen to him . Not in the mood . <eos>
 I am not denying it s a joyous day <eos>
 Where s your joy if you cannot sing ? <eos>
 I was with the Princess . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 By the pond . She was teasing me . <eos>
 Go on . go on . <eos>
 Barely living from the looks of it . <eos>
 No no no . this s different ! <eos>
 We seek to undo the curse . <eos>
 Gonna make ogre stew ! <eos>
 Well done lad . <eos>
 Three cheers for our champion . <eos>
 Sweet slippers of Oisin ! <eos>
 They have fired the moat ! <eos>
 Aye . my Lord . <eos>
 Rise Screwball and into the basket with you . <eos>
 How are these ? <eos>
 They will do nicely . <eos>
 Dolt ! <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 These for me ? <eos>
 If you like . <eos>
 You promised ! <eos>
 Never . <eos>
 But you did . you did ! <eos>
 I may have said perhaps . <eos>
 Liar ! <eos>
 Or perchance . <eos>
 Blackheart . Aptly named . <eos>
 Oh fie . What about the unicorn ? <eos>
 Unicorn ? <eos>
 A promise s a sacred oath . <eos>
 All right . I will show you something sacred . <eos>
 Stop complaining . <eos>
 A gentleman would offer water . <eos>
 What shall we do ? <eos>
 Be patient . <eos>
 Oh dear . <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 How much longer ? <eos>
 Shhh ! <eos>
 Such grace . and their smell it s ambrosia . <eos>
 They rival the angels of paradise . <eos>
 Are you honest ? <eos>
 Jack ! <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>
 To fetch your napkin . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 My father and the Baron . <eos>
 They tricked you . <eos>
 My own father . <eos>
 How bad was the unicorn s wound ? <eos>
 He did run ? <eos>
 Oh yes and the mare with him . <eos>
 I do not want it on me . <eos>
 Its powers are strong . <eos>
 My lady mocks me . <eos>
 Nay Jack I am but wary of your intentions . <eos>
 Tis not fit for a princess . <eos>
 Be it fit for your wife Green Jack ? <eos>
 I have no wife . <eos>
 Then perchance you will me . <eos>
 If wishes were horses even beggars would ride . <eos>
 Lili ! No ! <eos>
 Jack . Forgive me . <eos>
 What have I done ? <eos>
 Only what s right . <eos>
 I thought you were dead . I <eos>
 I was bewitched . it s better this way . <eos>
 They told me you were dead . <eos>
 No ! I wo not let it happen . <eos>
 You have freed me Jack . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Sunlight . It destroys him . <eos>
 Sunlight ? <eos>
 That s why he goes masked during the day . <eos>
 So he s hiding in the dark . <eos>
 In the dark . where I join him . <eos>
 Oh no dearest Jack . I meant every word . <eos>
 You are teasing still . <eos>
 Lili . I love you ! <eos>
 And I love you my husband . <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 Ouch ! Something s biting me . <eos>
 Biting you ? <eos>
 Pinching me ! <eos>
 Pinching ? Where ? <eos>
 Everywhere ! Ow ! <eos>
 I can not see a thing . <eos>
 Oona ? Do you suppose it s a faerie ? <eos>
 Ow ! Whatever it s it hurts . <eos>
 Step lively now ! <eos>
 His feet shall never cross my lips . <eos>
 Ask away sweet man . <eos>
 What became of the princess ? <eos>
 Princess ? I know of no princess . <eos>
 Is she fair this princess ? <eos>
 Exceeding fair . <eos>
 As fair as me ? <eos>
 She s dead ! <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Dead dead dead . <eos>
 I do not believe you . <eos>
 Tis not the time to speak of cheer . <eos>
 You will visit again ? <eos>
 As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom . <eos>
 Courage Jack . <eos>
 I pray God grants it me . <eos>
 This s not the time for squabbling . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 I would be honored . <eos>
 Only that ? <eos>
 And charmed of course . <eos>
 I had no thought of offending you Oona . <eos>
 Do I not please you Jack ? <eos>
 In every way . <eos>
 And am I not fair ? <eos>
 Wondrously so . <eos>
 That was in jest . <eos>
 Jest with me then . <eos>
 How so ? <eos>
 And sweet ? <eos>
 Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind . <eos>
 Pray you be sweet as your words dear Jack . <eos>
 Nay Oona tis not possible . <eos>
 A faerie s love makes anything possible . <eos>
 I am promised to another ! <eos>
 You . you . you mortal you ! <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 What do we do now ? <eos>
 We wait . <eos>
 What s she doing ? <eos>
 I think she s about to foal . <eos>
 I am in your debt Screwball . <eos>
 Watch behind or I will never collect on it ! <eos>
 Praise be to God . <eos>
 Small miracles better than no miracles . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Up ahead ! <eos>
 What care the bones when the soul s free ? <eos>
 Bah ! You faeries have the morals of ferrets . <eos>
 Sorry Jack . <eos>
 It s done . we will never catch him . <eos>
 How came you by this blade ? <eos>
 I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it . <eos>
 Uhm . fine work . <eos>
 Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy . <eos>
 You are with us in battle . <eos>
 May God protect you . <eos>
 No hurt Jimmy sir . oh no please sir . <eos>
 I am sending you back to Hell ! <eos>
 Can you show us the way ? <eos>
 To Castle Couer de Noir ? <eos>
 Let that be our problem just get us there . <eos>
 You follow . <eos>
 Plenty treasure inside . Jimmy seen it once . <eos>
 You have been inside ? <eos>
 In a dream . <eos>
 Marco ! <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 I am not cheating ! I am not looking ! <eos>
 Dad s disappeared ! <eos>
 He was there and then he was not ! <eos>
 Are you going to see Sam again ? <eos>
 I thought I might stop by . <eos>
 Did you know him before you knew Dad ? <eos>
 Since seventh grade . <eos>
 He s not there . <eos>
 He s here . Check the bathroom . <eos>
 I checked everywhere . He s not there . <eos>
 When does George get to come see his house ? <eos>
 It s so beautiful . <eos>

 Mom ? <eos>

 I put him to work . <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 I could not get it to go down . <eos>
 And why was the alarm on ? <eos>
 You would better call and cancel . <eos>
 Oh God we do not want the police ! <eos>
 What are you doing up so early ? <eos>
 I could not sleep last night . <eos>
 Why ? What do you mean ? <eos>
 Uh . using Josh like that . <eos>
 I am going to bed . <eos>
 Has he eaten anything at all ? <eos>
 Atonement . <eos>
 Who are all these people ? <eos>
 Sorry I got you into trouble . <eos>
 I will survive . <eos>
 He must . <eos>
 He seems lonely . <eos>
 Are you his friend ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I am living here while I build another house . <eos>
 Is that legal ? <eos>
 Do not you have school ? <eos>
 Nope . <eos>
 What s today ? <eos>

 What s that ? <eos>
 You are a good girl . <eos>
 I need to ask you something Mr . Nelson . <eos>
 You have to ask like that ? <eos>
 I want you to try something with me okay ? <eos>
 My mother would die . <eos>
 Let s shut up and not kill her . <eos>
 It s not what I was expecting . <eos>
 What did you think it would be ? <eos>
 Hey . <eos>
 What are you doing here ? <eos>
 Where to ? <eos>
 I am supposed to be in Tahoe . <eos>
 Your dad s really gonna build his house ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 You should stay . <eos>

 Where s your dad ? <eos>
 He jumped into the ocean . <eos>
 Tell him I said hi . <eos>
 He s a freak . <eos>
 You look better without make up . <eos>
 I can not even take a shower here . <eos>
 I might not stay anyway . <eos>
 I will get your back . <eos>
 No . That s okay . <eos>
 Do you remember me from when you lived here ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Your dad dated my mom after her divorce . <eos>
 Really ? <eos>
 I wanted him to marry her . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Turn over . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 I can use your mom s . <eos>
 I am okay . <eos>
 Hand me a towel . I am getting out . <eos>
 I am coming in . <eos>
 I do not want you to ! <eos>
 We are not gonna do anything . <eos>
 Why are you so stupid ? <eos>
 Why are you so uptight ? <eos>
 What s the point of this ? <eos>
 Does everything have to have a point ? <eos>
 Are you sure you are totally into guys ? <eos>
 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 Josh said . <eos>
 I am not gay . <eos>
 I thought I was helping you . <eos>
 It would help me if I could kiss you . <eos>
 On the handlebars or your shoulders ? <eos>
 Are you afraid of heights ? <eos>
 You would hate him for the trick . <eos>
 Not if what he left me was real . <eos>
 Where are you ? <eos>
 Floating to Catalina . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 He wo not leave my room . <eos>
 Will he talk to me ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 And of course the Beck s with the . <eos>
 It could have been a squirt gun . <eos>
 You have been good this week . <eos>
 Are you guys friends ? <eos>
 We have known each other since grade school . <eos>
 Mr . Stevens ? <eos>
 I have been dreading you . <eos>
 A violation ? <eos>
 Oh yes . <eos>
 And if I enclosed it ? <eos>
 An exhaust system or a window s code . <eos>
 A sink ? <eos>
 Allowed outside the enclosed area . <eos>
 I hate to ask about a window . <eos>
 I flushed it down the toilet . <eos>
 It s thirty feet . <eos>
 Well if it s we have a problem . <eos>
 That would take weeks . <eos>
 Months . <eos>
 I am good thanks . <eos>
 What are you on ? <eos>
 Pardon me ? <eos>

 Right . she married . what was he ? <eos>
 He buys and sells the world . <eos>
 I have been here twenty years . <eos>
 Maybe that s too long . <eos>
 Maybe . <eos>
 That s too long . <eos>
 Oh . <eos>
 How old are you ? <eos>
 Forty . <eos>
 Listen . maybe I can get you a year . <eos>
 I hate this job . <eos>
 For everything . <eos>
 Well I feel better about this now . <eos>
 Good . I was hoping for that . <eos>
 I have got one favor to ask . <eos>
 What can I do for you George ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Well it s the least I can do . <eos>

 This has got to stop ! <eos>
 He escaped . He s going back in . <eos>
 There are no windows facing my . exposure . <eos>
 George this s the third time . <eos>
 The plumber s due out on Friday . <eos>
 You will have to explain that to the police . <eos>
 You were the only neighbor I could tolerate . <eos>
 I did warn you . <eos>
 I forgot where I put my keys . <eos>
 And you thought they might be under her dress ? <eos>
 The whole summer man . Party in Tahoe . <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime . <eos>
 To check up on me ? <eos>
 I will be around to check up on you . <eos>
 Why would you be there ? <eos>
 Because I live there . <eos>
 You live in Cory s parents cabin ? <eos>
 I am not going ! <eos>
 I will get your bag . <eos>
 I am not going ! <eos>
 You do not have a choice . <eos>

 Probably in the bible . <eos>
 Goodnight . <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 I warned you yesterday . <eos>
 I hate turkey . <eos>
 No you do not . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 It bugs me . <eos>
 You will have money when you work . <eos>
 You are so predictable . <eos>
 No one would blame me if I left ! <eos>
 I would blame you . I want you here . <eos>
 I am not doing it ! <eos>
 It will be fine . <eos>
 I am leaving . <eos>
 Hey . hey ! <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>

 Well until you know you can not go . <eos>
 Oh okay . <eos>
 Where s it ? <eos>
 A friend of yours s here . <eos>
 Did you got through my pants ? <eos>
 I might have a solution . <eos>
 You are too fucking late . <eos>
 The gloves on the table are for you . <eos>
 You can not make me do a thing . <eos>
 Sit down for a second . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Hi Alyssa . <eos>
 Hi Mom . <eos>
 I took some of your Vicodin . <eos>
 I know . Why ? <eos>
 I like how it feels not to feel . <eos>
 I know the feeling . <eos>
 How do you become something you are not ? <eos>
 What would you like to be ? <eos>
 What I am not . <eos>
 What are you now ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 That s not true . <eos>
 I know parts of who you are . <eos>
 What do you know about me ? <eos>
 I wish you had told me then . <eos>
 I am telling you now . <eos>
 I gave up on you . <eos>
 What would you be doing now ? <eos>
 Getting high I guess . <eos>
 If I asked you to stop would you ? <eos>
 Sun glasses ? <eos>
 To hide a black eye . <eos>
 Why would not she leave ? <eos>
 I loved him too much . <eos>
 After everything he did to you and your mom ? <eos>
 After everything . <eos>
 That s so weird . <eos>
 She seemed upset . <eos>
 What s wrong with your back ? <eos>
 The kind where there s not really an answer . <eos>
 I still do not know what that means . <eos>
 The kind where there s not really an answer . <eos>
 I still do not know what that means . <eos>
 And you told Mom today ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I do not wanna go Sam . <eos>
 Here . <eos>
 I would eat a lot of red meat . <eos>
 Good for you . <eos>
 What would you do ? <eos>
 I would build a house . <eos>
 What kind of house ? <eos>
 You know what mortise and tenon is ? <eos>
 Can you build a house in four months ? <eos>
 I can die trying . <eos>
 Good for you . <eos>
 I have not been touched in years . <eos>
 Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty . <eos>
 Left you this place . <eos>
 Thanks for telling me . <eos>
 At least your father tried George . <eos>
 Ah ! Oh . <eos>
 I know there s an explanation . <eos>
 I need you to do me a favor . <eos>
 God you look like crap George . <eos>
 I want you to find someone for me . <eos>
 How many bedrooms will your house have ? <eos>
 Three . <eos>
 I just wanted to know where Mom was ? <eos>
 Oh . Sorry . <eos>
 It s okay . <eos>
 She needs to be alone I think . <eos>
 Because Dad left ? <eos>
 She s a little sad s all . <eos>
 You should lock your doors . <eos>
 Ring the bell before you try the door . <eos>
 Lock the door behind you . <eos>
 Where s he ? <eos>
 Where he always is . <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 He does not answer . <eos>
 He never answers . <eos>
 Why does he have a lock on his door ? <eos>
 A blueprint spool . <eos>
 Where have you been for a week ? <eos>
 Four days . I left to think . <eos>
 What did you do with your dog ? <eos>
 Kurt s been feeding him . <eos>
 But you can not call me while you think ? <eos>
 I need to talk to you . <eos>
 Why would they tow your truck ? <eos>
 I was parked in day parking . <eos>
 Why call me ? <eos>
 There s nothing anymore to stop me . <eos>
 Money ? <eos>
 I love those doors . <eos>
 Where will you live ? <eos>
 The garage . <eos>
 Forget it really . I will survive . <eos>
 I want him with me . <eos>
 No you do not . Trust me . <eos>
 Hey hey ! <eos>
 I am married . <eos>
 I do not have a phone . <eos>
 I drove over and you were gone . <eos>
 I can not leave the house ? <eos>
 Last time you were gone for a week ! <eos>
 I did say he could go . <eos>
 Let s go . <eos>
 We are fine . Turkey sandwiches . <eos>
 Well for later then . <eos>
 It makes me sad . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I used to live here . <eos>
 Which ? <eos>
 The first and the last . <eos>
 It s not breakfast yet . <eos>
 I dreamed about your house last night . <eos>
 Finished or unfinished ? <eos>
 That was not a dream . That was Sam . <eos>
 Oh . with his ear infection ! <eos>
 I have been wrong a lot in my life . <eos>
 Hindsight . It s like foresight without a future . <eos>
 With your hands or your tongue ? <eos>
 You are not well . <eos>
 I thought you would be up with the sun . <eos>
 My stupid back . <eos>
 Do you need help ? <eos>
 I think so . <eos>
 It s been a while . <eos>
 This was my very first slow dance . <eos>
 I smiled at him . <eos>
 Watch out for the smile boys . <eos>
 Let s see if you have gotten any better . <eos>
 Oh I am worse . Much much worse . <eos>
 I thought we were helping . <eos>
 I can hire workers to help me . <eos>
 Nothing s going on with us s it ? <eos>
 Going on ? <eos>
 That was the truth . <eos>
 You have never said that before . <eos>
 It sounded like a pick up line . <eos>
 I can not pick you up . <eos>
 I am married . <eos>
 You bit my finger . <eos>
 If I were not married ? <eos>
 Let s not do this okay ? <eos>
 I need to know . <eos>
 Is your back still killing you ? <eos>
 I did not think you would come today . <eos>
 No . Mostly me . <eos>
 Peter left me yesterday . <eos>
 Left you ? <eos>
 What did he say ? <eos>
 I will be in the bedroom . <eos>
 Back . Neck . Back . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I could die . <eos>
 So could I . <eos>
 Are you going to kiss me ? <eos>
 It s not my back that s killing me . <eos>
 Do not move ! <eos>
 I am an idiot to have you up there . <eos>
 I better get the kids home . <eos>
 Not a perfect day . <eos>
 Been thinking ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 It will take you like twenty thirty minutes . <eos>
 Does Alyssa know ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 You got any weed ? <eos>
 You got the money ? <eos>
 What s your deal with Alyssa ? <eos>
 Do not even . I am there . <eos>
 I was not sure . <eos>
 It s just a joke . A stupid joke . <eos>
 I could use the money . <eos>
 He said he heard hammering . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 Then you tell me what just happened ? <eos>
 The payoff . <eos>
 His father s a man . <eos>
 A man he respects . <eos>
 We have eaten . <eos>
 Is Lois still here ? I am starved . <eos>
 I will make you something . <eos>
 Should I ? <eos>
 It would worry me . <eos>
 To shave your chest ? <eos>
 We should take a vacation . <eos>
 I am helping George build his house . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I can not go right now . <eos>
 You can not go because of Sam ? <eos>
 I was talking about our marriage . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 That sounds pathetic does not it ? <eos>
 What are you doing home ? <eos>
 You never really trusted me . <eos>
 You live a fabulous life Robin . <eos>
 Despite you . <eos>
 I never asked for more . <eos>
 That s the problem . <eos>
 Please do not leave me . <eos>
 Where are the kids ? <eos>
 Sam took them to a movie . <eos>
 I will be in the bedroom . <eos>

 I did not go in your room . <eos>
 Can you stay for dinner ? <eos>
 Depends on what I would give up on . <eos>
 The door was open . <eos>
 I do not know what I am doing . <eos>
 You are sure about this ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 You could keep it and rent it out ? <eos>
 This s what he wants . <eos>
 Run downstairs and give your dad a hug . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 He will be gone for his birthday . <eos>
 Queer . <eos>

 He tried . It did not take . <eos>
 And Corporal . . be careful . <eos>

 Why then things should be fine . <eos>
 Rachel not feeling well ? <eos>

 Out of the mouths of babes Louis . <eos>
 This babe has said enough . <eos>

 It s Ellie s cat . <eos>
 Nope . He s your cat now . <eos>
 but I think the thought has crossed your mind . <eos>
 Shit ! Look at this mess ! <eos>
 Ayuh it s a mess all right . <eos>
 Because something called a wendigo soured the ground . <eos>
 And because the dead walked . <eos>
 Leave me alone ! <eos>
 Remember . <eos>
 Let her go . It s cool . <eos>
 Louis the house s beautiful . <eos>
 And Buckaroo Banzai . <eos>

 Extraordinarily morbid maybe . <eos>
 That s enough of that kind of talk ! <eos>
 I just said <eos>
 Getting there . <eos>
 I got eggs down here ! <eos>
 Good d <eos>
 I am going to try to do better . <eos>
 You are doing fine . <eos>

 AnaMaria trim the mainsail ! <eos>

 Elizabeth goes free ! <eos>
 We got that part . Anything else ? <eos>
 Say the name or I slit your throat . <eos>
 No you wo not . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 I am supposed to . trust you ? <eos>
 Blast you ! I will throw you in prison . <eos>
 Wait as long as you like . <eos>
 So how did you get off that island anyway ? <eos>
 You can go to your grave not knowing . <eos>
 That s fair . <eos>
 No I really think I do . <eos>
 All right then . <eos>
 The situation has changed . <eos>
 That so ? <eos>
 Now you can take care of the Dauntless right ? <eos>
 Men ! Are you up for it ? <eos>
 There s . another exit ? <eos>
 Aye for us there is . <eos>
 Now ? <eos>

 You have got sand for a maid . <eos>
 Thank you sir . <eos>
 Maid or not it fits you . <eos>
 Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner ? <eos>
 Now none of that . Please dig in . <eos>
 Then why are not you eating ? <eos>
 Would that I could . <eos>
 Do you not know what this s then ? <eos>
 It s a pirate medallion . <eos>
 Man overboard ! <eos>
 Boy overboard ! <eos>
 Fetch a hook haul him out of there ! <eos>
 I can not breathe . <eos>
 I am a bit nervous myself <eos>
 Commodore you can not do that ! <eos>
 You are speaking up for him again ? <eos>
 Elizabeth I hereby withdraw my proposal . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I know where your heart truly lies . <eos>
 Then I can wear men s clothing . <eos>
 That would hardly be proper . <eos>
 Ceremony ? <eos>
 Captain Norrington s promotion ceremony . <eos>
 Elizabeth this s hardly appropriate <eos>
 About the day we met . Do you remember ? <eos>
 I am glad we got here in time . <eos>
 Truthfully you were a bit late . <eos>
 If I had known <eos>
 then we never would have met . <eos>
 It does not ! <eos>
 but that was not a proper kiss . <eos>
 Miss Swann . <eos>
 Miss Swann if you will be so kind ? <eos>
 You ? <eos>
 Me ! <eos>
 You are in league with Barbossa ! <eos>
 No I am rescuing you . <eos>
 To freedom . <eos>
 To the Black Pearl . <eos>
 You did not tell Commodore Norrington everything . <eos>
 Nor did you I noticed . <eos>
 We would best drop canvas sir ! <eos>
 She can hold a bit longer . <eos>
 Blast it I am already awake ! <eos>
 I know . That was for the smell . <eos>
 We are not going to just surrender ! <eos>
 That we are . <eos>
 Sir ! Shall I break out the cannons ? <eos>
 I do not think that will be necessary . <eos>
 This dock s off limits to civilians . <eos>
 Sorry I did not know . <eos>
 What s your name ? <eos>
 Smith . <eos>
 Well well . Jack Sparrow s not it ? <eos>
 Captain Jack Sparrow . If you please . <eos>
 But it seems to be enough to condemn him . <eos>
 Indeed . <eos>
 You threatened Miss Swann . <eos>
 Only a little . <eos>
 You cheated . <eos>
 Pirate . <eos>
 Move away . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Move ! <eos>
 Somewhat . <eos>
 Where does it make berth ? <eos>
 Why ask me ? <eos>
 Because you are a pirate . <eos>
 And you want to turn pirate yourself ? <eos>
 Never . They took Miss Swann . <eos>
 I can get you out of here . <eos>
 How ? The key s run off . <eos>
 Agreed . <eos>
 Agreed ! <eos>
 Not without my effects . <eos>
 We need to go ! <eos>
 I would die for her . <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 This s either crazy or brilliant . <eos>
 Remarkable how often those two traits coincide . <eos>
 Is that so ? <eos>
 My father . William Turner ? <eos>
 That s not true . <eos>
 I swear you look just like him . <eos>
 It s not true my father was a pirate . <eos>
 Figured you would not want to hear it . <eos>
 Sure because he could always go pirating . <eos>
 My father was not a pirate ! <eos>
 Tortuga ? <eos>
 Oh did I forget to mention that ? <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Depends . <eos>
 On what ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I will lead them away . <eos>
 Do you have any idea where you are going ? <eos>
 Jack ! <eos>
 Are you certain this s the right way ? <eos>
 It s the right way . <eos>
 The Black Pearl s a real ship . <eos>
 No it s not . <eos>
 Yes it is . I have seen it . <eos>
 You have seen it ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You have seen the Black Pearl ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You have not seen it . <eos>
 Yes I have . <eos>
 . No . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 But I have seen a ship with black sails . <eos>
 I think he s telling the truth . <eos>
 He s not telling the truth . <eos>
 He may be . <eos>
 Mentioned it s more what he did . <eos>
 Still <eos>
 He s still breathing . <eos>
 Where did he come from ? <eos>
 Has my daughter given you an answer yet ? <eos>
 No . She has not . <eos>
 Commodore <eos>
 A moment . <eos>
 But <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 Dammit man it appears someone s stealing your ship ! <eos>
 How long do you leave him in there ? <eos>
 Until he s done . <eos>
 Speak . <eos>
 Dr . Bright has escaped . <eos>
 Wheelchair accessible . <eos>
 Dr . Argon I demand an explanation . <eos>
 Something to drink Dr . Bright ? <eos>
 No thank you . <eos>
 What are you going to do to him ? <eos>
 Do ? Well I suppose that depends on you . <eos>
 How apropos . <eos>
 Ai not it . <eos>
 I know what you are doing . <eos>
 You mean besides kicking your ass ? <eos>
 Like rotting meat . <eos>
 You are not rotting meat . <eos>
 It s ready now I know it is . <eos>
 She says it s not . <eos>
 And you think O Brien s that leverage ? <eos>
 That remains to be seen . <eos>
 Poppy are you in one of your moods again ? <eos>
 No Icky this s real . <eos>
 Why are there two ottomans ? <eos>
 Icarus please ! This s important ! <eos>
 Yes . Yes of course it is . <eos>
 Then you still love me ? <eos>
 Poppy please just tell me what you want . <eos>
 It will be an ascension . <eos>
 I am so excited Icarus . <eos>
 I was wondering if you would finished considering ? <eos>
 Considering what ? <eos>
 What I asked you earlier ? <eos>
 Poppy please <eos>
 If you loved me like I loved you ? <eos>
 Poppy this s not the time ! <eos>
 Where did he go ? <eos>
 The trunk . <eos>
 Wait wait can I at least have his body ? <eos>
 Donated to science . Perfect . <eos>
 Hey ! <eos>
 You do not want this . <eos>
 Yeah I do ! <eos>
 What did security say ? <eos>
 They will in validate the key . Probably nothing . <eos>
 Well you got another problem . <eos>
 The replicators ? <eos>
 You were never invited to my house . <eos>
 You are looking for a urine sample . <eos>
 Is that what Argon told you ? <eos>
 No ! Well not those exact words . <eos>
 Nigel can not you see he s using you ? <eos>
 You are afraid of him . <eos>
 Who s not ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 It s Sim . We are almost there . <eos>
 What s it smell like ? <eos>
 Smell ? Uh something like methylcyanoacrylate . <eos>
 Like Crazy Glue ? <eos>
 Sir please try to hold still . <eos>
 So I guess it worked . <eos>
 When did you . <eos>
 Been out for six months now . <eos>
 Really ? What have you been doing ? <eos>
 You know this and that . <eos>
 Somebody has to . <eos>
 Same old Daniel . <eos>
 The big house ? <eos>
 The big house . <eos>
 And for cleaning up oil spills . <eos>
 Right . You predicted it . <eos>
 Nothing really worthwhile . <eos>
 That s what I thought . <eos>
 Yeah we will see . <eos>
 We will see ? What does that mean ? <eos>
 Daniel give him the Trix . <eos>
 Susan this s the future of America here . <eos>
 Susie ! You gotta help me ! <eos>
 Daniel what are you doing here ? <eos>
 Sorry Daniel I am a physicist not a psychiatrist . <eos>
 No something s really wrong . look ! <eos>
 They did it to me ! <eos>
 The nanobot . <eos>
 . just like the mouse . <eos>
 Mouse ? What mouse ? <eos>
 My first organic polymerization was a lab mouse . <eos>
 What happened to it ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Daniel ! <eos>
 I am a plastic man ! A plastic man ! <eos>
 We do not have time for hysterics . <eos>
 We do not ? <eos>
 That was an egg ? <eos>
 Three days ago it was . <eos>
 What do these replicators do to people ? <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Is not it already too late then ? <eos>
 Is something wrong ? <eos>
 No no I just feel wired ! <eos>
 Susan ! <eos>
 What ? What s wrong ? <eos>
 Look at this ! <eos>
 What about it ! <eos>
 What s that supposed to mean ? <eos>
 Just giving credit where credit s due . <eos>
 You have no one to blame but yourself . <eos>
 Blame the victim . <eos>
 Just like old times . <eos>
 Yeah . Old times . <eos>
 Probably the caffeine . <eos>
 Do you have something to bring me down ? <eos>
 No problem . <eos>
 Uh oh . I remember that temper . <eos>
 Daniel I did not hear you come down . <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 The nanobot . it s not here . <eos>
 It s still inside me ? <eos>
 How far can you stretch ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 What did you want my hair for ? <eos>
 Something else I want to try . <eos>
 That s pretty good . <eos>
 Getting used to it . <eos>
 That s going to fit me ? <eos>
 Like a glove . <eos>
 Did you go ? <eos>
 On the counter . <eos>
 Who s he ? <eos>
 The head shrinker at the prison . <eos>
 Where s it ? <eos>
 Argon s private lab . <eos>
 Let s go . <eos>
 Run Daniel ! Get out of here ! <eos>
 I am not leaving without you Susan ! <eos>
 You saved my life . <eos>
 Did you think I could just leave you . <eos>
 We have got to get the nanobot . <eos>
 It s too late . Argon injected it . <eos>
 You mean he s polymerized like me ? <eos>
 That means the nanobot s still inside him . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You are not going after Argon ! <eos>
 I have to ! <eos>
 I remember I was trying to help . <eos>
 God what a fight that was . <eos>
 We were different people then . <eos>
 Things do change . <eos>
 I guess they do . <eos>
 What ? I am not going anywhere ! <eos>
 Oh yes you are ! <eos>
 All the different ways that I could kill you . <eos>
 Oh yeah ? <eos>
 That s impossible . <eos>
 It s a miracle . <eos>
 Oh yeah he s alive . Technically . <eos>
 And you have him ? <eos>
 We lost him . <eos>
 Vermin . <eos>
 Can I help you Mrs . Argon ? <eos>
 Icky ! <eos>
 Get him Daniel ! Knock his block off ! <eos>
 Okay Barbie let s get this over with . <eos>
 Do not worry four eyes . <eos>

 Indeed ? How interesting . <eos>
 Yes s not it . <eos>
 Goodbye Miss Gallagher . <eos>

 You are all right . <eos>

 No give you another guess . <eos>
 Will you step into the library ? <eos>
 Sure I will take a chance . <eos>
 Will uh five thousand be enough ? <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 For the letters of course . <eos>
 Of course I am Stewart . <eos>

 Welcome to Charenton Abbe du Maupas . <eos>
 I am pleased to have the new post sir . <eos>
 We ought not be reading his nasty stories <eos>
 No one s forcing you to listen . <eos>
 You have been to his quarters have not you ? <eos>
 Once or twice . <eos>
 He s a writer not a madman . <eos>
 Then what s he doing here ? <eos>
 At your service Count . <eos>
 Now give the signal . <eos>
 Madeleine <eos>
 Yes Abbe ? <eos>
 Do not say that reading s my salvation . <eos>
 But why must you indulge in his pornography ? <eos>
 Do not turn us out Abbe . <eos>
 Turn you out ? <eos>
 By whom ? The Marquis ? <eos>
 Mother s not half so blind as you . <eos>
 Go back to your room . Quickly . <eos>
 What ? What have I done ? <eos>
 Do not come back not tonight not again <eos>
 You will hate me now wo not you ? <eos>
 Free his mouth . <eos>
 Must not do that sir . <eos>
 I must grant him his last rites . <eos>
 Care for a splash of wine Abbe ? <eos>
 It s not even noon <eos>
 Enough to discern its tenor . <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 They can not be serious . <eos>
 Our future lies in the stroke of your pen . <eos>
 Mightier than the sword indeed . <eos>
 You mean to take us all down with you ? <eos>
 Do not be absurd it s only a play . <eos>
 He can not do that to me . <eos>
 How can one man possibly be so selfish ? <eos>
 I have a proposition . <eos>
 You always do . <eos>
 Part the gates of heaven as it were <eos>
 That s enough . <eos>
 Good day Marquis . <eos>
 THEN BUGGER ME ! <eos>
 water ! <eos>
 and your meat shall be de boned . <eos>
 WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE ? <eos>
 Because your writing continues unchecked . <eos>
 What on earth would that require ? <eos>
 A night spent with the partner of my choice . <eos>
 You expect me to pimp Madeleine ? <eos>
 I was not talking about Madeleine . <eos>
 OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES ! <eos>
 Coulmier you animal ! <eos>
 I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT MARQUIS ! <eos>
 Oh I am to be blamed now am I ? <eos>
 Your words drove Bouchon to <eos>
 It s no secret that you loved her . <eos>
 Oh that s rich coming from her lapdog <eos>
 I saw the longing in your eye <eos>
 that was lust <eos>
 the passion in your heart <eos>
 Do not confuse one organ with another <eos>
 I know because I felt it myself <eos>
 I WANTED TO FUCK HER THAT S ALL ! <eos>
 AND DID YOU ? <eos>
 IT S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK . <eos>
 Go to hell ! <eos>
 Why was it you never took her by force ? <eos>
 Who s to say I did not ? <eos>
 Was it impotence ? <eos>
 NEVER ! <eos>
 Then it must have been love <eos>
 Abbe de Coulmier ! <eos>
 I am here . <eos>
 Surely you will grant me a final word . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It s a formality truly . <eos>
 His wife s influence . <eos>
 His wife s ? <eos>
 Oh . That . <eos>
 Well . <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 He s sworn to obedience . <eos>
 I have . <eos>
 then I have friends of my own to visit . <eos>
 Madame Bougival Mademoiselle Clairwil and of course the Marquis wife <eos>
 Oh indeed ? <eos>
 It was fiction of course . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It was not inspired by circumstance . <eos>
 No . It most certainly was not . <eos>
 If only blood will appease you then shed mine . <eos>
 You would suffer in her stead ? <eos>
 My my . You have exceeded my expectations . <eos>
 And my own . <eos>
 How s the patient faring ? <eos>
 Poorly . <eos>
 And you ? It must have been an ordeal . <eos>
 I will be waiting . <eos>
 Maybe someday you will tell me your name . <eos>
 You asked my name once it s Madeleine . <eos>
 Sweet then ? Like the pastry ? <eos>
 It s not your cup of tea Mama . <eos>
 Come now darling give it a read . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Well worth the dig ! <eos>
 I am only a laundress not a detective . <eos>
 Now s not the time to be cheeky Maddy . <eos>
 I am hungry for a proper visit . <eos>
 Do not start <eos>
 If only these coins purchased your other talents too . <eos>
 There s something else I want from you . <eos>
 Is it awfully violent ? <eos>
 Most assuredly . <eos>
 Is it terribly erotic ? <eos>
 Fiendishly so . <eos>
 The story s thrilling conclusion comes at a premium . <eos>
 What s that then ? <eos>
 Yes ! You shall . Of course you shall <eos>
 A tale more horrible than all the rest combined ! <eos>
 You would do that rather than forsake our love ? <eos>
 No . But tell him I would . <eos>
 It s tainted money Doctor . <eos>
 What a beautiful thought Marquise . <eos>
 What thought s that ? <eos>
 Oh but I am ! <eos>
 words alone are insufficient . <eos>
 I am eternally in your debt . <eos>
 And I in yours . <eos>
 Hm ? Tell me . What other treats ? <eos>
 . shame on you truly . <eos>
 Leave at once <eos>
 But it s just begun <eos>
 Do as I say . <eos>
 Does not that please you ? <eos>

 That dress should be listed on the stock exchange . <eos>
 Big enough ? <eos>
 Fine . Corkscrew s on the right . <eos>
 What a day I have had ! <eos>
 Tired ? <eos>
 You can not buy that kind of publicity . <eos>

 The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage . <eos>
 We will consider it a prisoner exchange . <eos>
 It s working . <eos>
 Where s he ? <eos>
 I thought he was the Chief Engineer . <eos>
 He is . <eos>
 Then when s he going to Engineering ? <eos>
 Target their Bridge . <eos>
 Full disruptors . <eos>
 This s its current position . <eos>
 Can you project its course ? <eos>
 Population ? <eos>
 Approximately two hundred thirty million . <eos>
 Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms . Where are the lifeforms <eos>
 Commander . <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response . <eos>
 Really ? What do you feel ? <eos>
 I get it . I get it . <eos>
 You get what ? <eos>
 That s it Bridge we are all out ! <eos>
 One minute to warp core breach . <eos>
 Sensors show five life signs aboard the station Captain . <eos>
 The station complement was nineteen . <eos>
 We are within range sir . <eos>
 Beam them directly to Sickbay . <eos>
 Deck 15 section 21 alpha . <eos>

 This s my uncle s barn in Iowa . <eos>
 Captain of the Enterprise huh ? <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Close to retirement ? <eos>
 I had not planned on it . <eos>
 You know Scotty it amazes me . <eos>
 And what would that be sir ? <eos>
 But I do have a theory . <eos>
 I thought you might . <eos>
 A photon torpedo ? <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 Load torpedo bays prepare to fire on my command . <eos>
 Keep her together until I get back . <eos>
 I always do . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Make it so . <eos>

 No sir . <eos>
 Thank you Number One . <eos>

 No . Thank you . <eos>
 That s a pretty big margin of error . <eos>
 Too big . How long until the ribbon arrives ? <eos>
 Captain are you all right ? <eos>
 Yes . Fine . If you will excuse me . <eos>
 Or perhaps they are on the surface . <eos>
 Mr . Data scan the planet for lifeforms . <eos>
 Doctor Soran ? <eos>
 Yes yes Captain . Thank you for coming . <eos>
 You must think I am quite the madman . <eos>
 The thought had crossed my mind . <eos>
 The royal . studs ? <eos>
 You see the top yardarm now look to the <eos>
 It looks like we are too late . <eos>
 There are no other ships in the system . <eos>
 These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors . <eos>
 Well that narrows it to Klingon Breen or Romulan . <eos>
 They have found a way to penetrate our shields . <eos>
 Lock phasers and return fire ! <eos>
 Enterprise maintaining full impulse power . <eos>
 And we are gaining . Stand by tractor beam ! <eos>
 Tractor beam aye ! <eos>
 Transwarp at your command Sir ! <eos>
 Execute ! <eos>
 Put me on the hailing frequency . <eos>
 Sure whatever games you wanna play . <eos>
 Shall I alert Dr . McCoy ? <eos>
 Yes . He has a long journey ahead . <eos>
 Response ? <eos>

 David <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Spock s burial robe . <eos>
 Later . Let s go . <eos>
 Grissom your message acknowledged . Will advise . Out . <eos>
 You mean we are stranded down here ? <eos>
 Logic indicates that s the case . <eos>
 Not exactly . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix . <eos>
 It was the only way to solve certain problems <eos>
 Did your collaborator know ? <eos>
 This planet s aging in surges . <eos>
 And Spock with it . They are joined together . <eos>
 Whoever they are they are getting closer . <eos>
 I will go . <eos>

 That distortion s closing rapidly . Opinion Sulu ? <eos>
 I think it s an energy form sir . <eos>
 . A cloaking device ? <eos>
 Red alert Mr . Scott . <eos>
 About a dozen officers and men . <eos>
 With some on the planet . <eos>

 Because you wish it . <eos>
 Genesis I want it . <eos>
 Beam the Vulcan up And we talk . <eos>
 Give me your hand and we both live . <eos>

 He would not have spoken of it openly . <eos>
 Then how <eos>
 . He spoke of your friendship . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He asked you not to grieve . <eos>
 . Yes . <eos>
 . The needs of the many outweigh . <eos>
 . The needs of the few . <eos>
 . Or the one . <eos>
 . Spock . <eos>
 Yes . But how . <eos>
 Sarek ! What if he melded with someone else ? <eos>
 Bones ! <eos>
 One alive one not . Yet both in pain . <eos>

 The power of creation <eos>
 Have they proceeded with their experiments ? <eos>
 What s she doing here ? <eos>
 Chekov s on Reliant s not he ? <eos>
 Is it possible their COMM system has failed ? <eos>
 It would explain a great many things <eos>
 Visual ! Mr . Sulu divert everything to the phasers <eos>
 Too late <eos>
 Not enough against their shields . <eos>
 Who the u hell u are they ? <eos>
 The prefix code ? <eos>
 It s all we have got . <eos>
 Reliant could be hiding behind that rock . <eos>
 A distinct possibility . <eos>
 What IS working around here ? <eos>
 Not much Admiral . We have partial main power . <eos>
 That s it ? <eos>
 Best we could do in two hours . <eos>
 Admiral they are reducing speed . <eos>
 Uhura patch me in <eos>

 They just do not want us going in there . <eos>
 Hold your course . Look sharp . <eos>
 At what . <eos>
 Mr . Saavik all stop . <eos>
 All stop sir . <eos>
 Descend ten thousand meters . Stand by photon torpedoes . <eos>
 Cease fire . Look sharp . <eos>

 All moorings are clear Captain . <eos>
 Thank you Mr . Saavik . <eos>
 Take her out Mr . Saavik . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Lieutenant the Admiral s aware of the Regulations . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Certainly . <eos>
 By the book . <eos>
 You lied . <eos>
 I exaggerated . <eos>
 I do not understand the final question . <eos>
 You are half human . The Computer knows that . <eos>
 The question s irrelevant . <eos>
 Where must you go ? <eos>
 To Earth . To offer testimony . <eos>
 You do this for friendship ? <eos>
 I do this because I was there <eos>
 Humans make illogical decisions . <eos>
 . They do indeed . <eos>
 Heard there was some excitement . <eos>
 Just a couple of kooks . <eos>
 How are you doing ? <eos>
 Fine . Just fine . <eos>
 Back home we call him the miracle worker . <eos>
 Indeed . May I offer you gentlemen anything ? <eos>
 You sure this s such a bright idea ? <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 It will come back to him . <eos>
 Are you sure ? That s what I thought . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu . Take us home . <eos>
 That s the general idea . <eos>
 That s crazy ! <eos>
 What did you say she was getting ? <eos>
 Cramps . <eos>
 An experimental device doctor . <eos>
 Tearing of the middle meningeal artery . <eos>
 Wake up man wake up ! <eos>

 You are joking . <eos>
 A joke s a story with a humorous climax . <eos>
 That s what I said Doctor . <eos>
 Then how . <eos>
 Angels and ministers of grace defend us . <eos>
 Hamlet Act I scene 4 . <eos>
 Naturally . So what s your problem ? <eos>
 Acceleration s no longer a constant . <eos>
 . Best shot . <eos>
 Guess Spock . Your best guess . <eos>
 Guessing s not in my nature . <eos>
 Well nobody s perfect . <eos>
 You are saying . It s a compliment . <eos>
 It is . <eos>
 We are just observing . <eos>
 I was not informed about observers . <eos>
 What the hell do you think you are doing ? <eos>
 Reading the patient s vital signs . <eos>
 Fundoscopic examination <eos>
 Fundoscopic examination s unrevealing in these cases ! <eos>
 Can you isolate the wave ? <eos>
 Negative . It s impacting on all our systems ! <eos>
 I have the coordinates of the reactor . <eos>
 . It gives me a great sense of history . <eos>
 All right Commander you wanna tell us anything ? <eos>
 Like what ? <eos>
 The top of what ? <eos>
 Name ? <eos>
 My name ? <eos>
 No u my u name . <eos>

 Cloaking device s stable . All systems normal . <eos>
 Stabilize Energy Reserve ! Report helm <eos>
 Can you protect us ? <eos>
 We are launching everything we have . <eos>
 I suppose they told you that . <eos>
 The hell they did . <eos>
 So you were at Berkeley . <eos>
 I was not . <eos>
 You sure you wo not change your mind ? <eos>
 Is there something wrong with the one I have ? <eos>
 We do not want to be any trouble . <eos>
 You have already been that . C mon . <eos>
 Can I ask u you u something ? <eos>
 Go ahead . <eos>
 They are gonna hafta take their chances . <eos>
 What does that mean exactly ? Take their chances . <eos>
 Do you trust me ? <eos>
 Implicitly . <eos>
 Just lucky I guess . <eos>
 You are upset about losing the whales . <eos>
 . You are very perceptive . <eos>
 How will that be done exactly ? <eos>
 Where could you take them ? <eos>
 Hm ? <eos>
 Sorry the time would have to be right now . <eos>
 What do you mean now ? <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 What s what ? <eos>

 Uhura . Get me through to Starfleet Command . <eos>
 Ready to engage computer Admiral . <eos>
 What s our target in time ? <eos>
 The late 20th Century . <eos>
 Surely you can be more specific . <eos>
 You have programmed that from memory . <eos>
 I have . <eos>
 There s a 20th Century possibility . <eos>
 Explain . <eos>
 Where would we find these reactors . Theoretically . <eos>
 Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels . <eos>
 How do you know this . <eos>
 . Simple logic . <eos>
 As you observed a primitive Culture . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Admiral may I ask you a question ? <eos>
 Spock . <eos>

 You know I need to verify this . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 It s not quite the face you remember . <eos>

 Do you think I am strange ? <eos>
 The world of the dead ? <eos>
 Could be . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 That s my telescope . <eos>
 Saturn . Beautiful . <eos>
 Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings <eos>
 But there are thousands of them made of floating ice <eos>
 Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart . <eos>
 Or building blocks for a world that never formed . <eos>
 Looking for intelligent life ? <eos>
 Looking for something someone . <eos>
 You are really into God right ? <eos>
 In ten words or less ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 My relationship with God s my own . <eos>
 But you think about Him It Her . <eos>
 Do not you ? <eos>
 You have to believe to have faith . <eos>
 You do not believe in anything ? <eos>
 Interpreted by another guy like my father . <eos>
 Your father does not like me . <eos>
 He does not trust you . <eos>
 Sometimes I do not even trust me . <eos>
 The play s going to be really good . <eos>
 I am really glad you think so . <eos>
 You are not in a very good mood . <eos>
 You do not miss a thing . <eos>
 The play s in a couple of weeks . <eos>
 Yes . And ? <eos>

 Belinda s a very jealous person . <eos>
 That would be the reason . <eos>
 He okay ? <eos>
 Healthy as can be . <eos>
 You were great the other night . <eos>
 Thank you . So were you . <eos>
 I have not been nice to you . <eos>
 You are hardly nice to anyone . <eos>
 People can see . <eos>
 And that would ruin your reputation how ? <eos>
 Maybe you inspire me . <eos>
 That sounds like horseshit . <eos>
 All of it . <eos>
 It s not . <eos>
 Prove it . <eos>
 I do not want to be just your friend <eos>
 You do not know what you want <eos>
 It s a start . <eos>
 Yeah with a finish in about a decade . <eos>
 So you are talking to me ? <eos>
 When I have something to say . <eos>

 It means you can do anything . <eos>

 But I do not want to be Miniaturized ! <eos>
 It s only for an hour <eos>
 This s Dr . Duval our Head Surgeon . <eos>
 Oh yes I have heard of you Doctor . <eos>
 Just one General . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Where can I get a cab back to town ? <eos>
 Ca not remember ? What do you mean ? <eos>
 He s blanked out on that one particular point . <eos>
 Difficult ? He s impossible ! <eos>
 That s no reason to suspect him of disloyalty . <eos>
 Listen . the Heart . <eos>
 Yes . slowed down agreat deal . <eos>
 We must ! <eos>
 With no laser <eos>
 Doctor . <eos>
 Yes Cora . <eos>
 I I want to say . <eos>
 We are pushing oxygen today . <eos>

 That will teach you where to keep your hand . <eos>
 Now I know . <eos>
 A long time with one man . <eos>
 Not working for someone like Dr . Duval <eos>
 Then how come it worked loose ? <eos>
 I have no idea . <eos>
 Should not you answer that ? <eos>
 Not now . We need air not greetings ! <eos>
 No it requires such absolute precision <eos>
 A surgeon might . <eos>
 Open it ! Open it before they get here ! <eos>
 I can not till the hatch s flooded ! <eos>
 No need to get up <eos>
 I feel much better now . <eos>
 Thank you for saving my life . <eos>
 That s what they pay me for . <eos>
 A great deal more than that I believe . <eos>
 Such as ? <eos>
 Keeping an eye on Dr . Duval . <eos>
 What gives you that idea ? <eos>
 What can we do ? <eos>
 Nothing against all that force . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve . <eos>
 I have done all I could with the laser . <eos>
 All I am asking s you test it beforehand ! <eos>
 and certain chemicals involving proteins <eos>
 You left something out . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 The Breath of God . <eos>
 I would hate to get lost on that Freeway . <eos>
 They all lead to the same place the Lungs . <eos>
 Do not tell me they are refueling . <eos>

 We need you for Security purposes Mr . Grant . <eos>
 At an operation ? <eos>
 Miss Peterson his Technical Assistant . <eos>
 How are you Miss Peterson ? <eos>
 Tell them to take us out . <eos>
 If there s any chance <eos>
 Request removal Mr . Grant . <eos>
 You have no right to blame Duval <eos>
 That line was tampered with . <eos>
 Two in a row ? <eos>
 It s possible <eos>
 I can not tell you . <eos>
 Where we going ? <eos>

 Go ahead . <eos>
 What would you do that for ? <eos>

 Then God does not exist . <eos>
 I have not spoken to him . <eos>

 Are you all right Barney ? <eos>
 No doubt you have heard the rumors . <eos>
 I take no account of gossip Your Highness . <eos>
 My concern s for the reputation of the Monarchy . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It s the Queen s decision . <eos>
 I beg your pardon ? Mama . <eos>
 I wish to see my mother . <eos>
 She s busy . <eos>
 Convey her a message . <eos>
 What did you say ? <eos>
 I said are you deaf as well as stupid ? <eos>
 Do you know who you address sir ? <eos>
 Whom you address . <eos>
 The future King ! <eos>
 Well everyone s entitled to their opinion . <eos>
 Out of my way ! <eos>
 Gesture ? <eos>
 I thought a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps ? <eos>

 Back and upper corridors . <eos>
 How will I know ? <eos>
 I am sorry ? <eos>

 You will be sent a message . <eos>
 Who will bring it to me ? <eos>
 Her Highness Equerry . <eos>
 I need a man who knows where I am . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 Yes . I do . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I beg your pardon ? <eos>
 Go inside at once . <eos>
 Is that the Queen s request ? <eos>
 Yes it most certainly is ! <eos>
 She will need to sign dispatches before she retires . <eos>
 That can wait till the weekend . <eos>
 There are important papers from <eos>
 It can wait . Anything else ? <eos>
 I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty . <eos>
 Do not think I can not persuade her . <eos>
 What do you know about the Highlands ? <eos>
 I am a blank sheet . <eos>
 Do you hunt ? <eos>
 Occasionally . <eos>
 Dare say you can be taught . <eos>
 To shoot perhaps but not to kill . <eos>
 If you hunt you kill . <eos>
 I am fine . <eos>
 You are injured . <eos>
 It s nothing . <eos>
 I am not married . <eos>
 Oh . <eos>
 This s the top . <eos>
 I would not know . <eos>
 Surely <eos>
 What I do I do for my Queen . <eos>
 Was there never ambition ? <eos>
 Maybe once . <eos>
 Then I envy yo . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I do what I do . <eos>
 For Her Majesty . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 But yourself ? What about John Brown ? <eos>
 I said . I serve the Queen . <eos>
 No other aspiration ? <eos>
 They do not see it . <eos>
 See what ? <eos>
 They are not as watchful as you . <eos>
 Too busy looking after themselves . <eos>
 The greasy pole . <eos>
 No loyalty . <eos>
 No love . <eos>
 She will never understand it . <eos>
 In time she will . <eos>
 She will think I betrayed her . <eos>
 Mr Brown . <eos>
 Ma am . <eos>
 You are here safely . <eos>
 Aye ma am . <eos>
 You are well ? <eos>

 Those over there there . <eos>
 Craobhan geanmchno fhiadhaich . <eos>
 I am thinking of publishing my Highland Journals . <eos>
 Are they worth reading ? <eos>
 I am told so . <eos>
 Who by ? <eos>
 Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming . <eos>
 What does he know about the Highlands ? <eos>
 He has been attending at Balmoral for many years . <eos>
 That does not make him an expert . <eos>
 We took a nip of whiskey . <eos>
 To keep out the cold . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 What s it John ? John ? <eos>
 I heard something . <eos>
 John ? <eos>
 Yes ma am ? <eos>

 Yes ma am . <eos>
 Ma am ? <eos>

 Because I have to ! <eos>
 What can we do ? <eos>
 Oh several things . <eos>
 Then they may read about me . <eos>
 Indeed and for that they are eternally grateful . <eos>
 Is that not enough ? <eos>
 This s my good John Brown . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Should we take it seriously ? <eos>
 The cartoon or Her Majesty s absenteeism ? <eos>
 Well both . <eos>
 The question s do we need her ? <eos>
 Surely you are not suggesting we dispense <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 We will see which way the wind blows . <eos>
 I see the Prince of Wales s here . <eos>
 I hope he got his mother s permission . <eos>
 What did he want ? <eos>
 To know when he will be king . <eos>
 We are going to lose . <eos>
 You can not know that for sure . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 Mrs Brown . <eos>
 She s refusing to leave Balmoral . <eos>
 What s her excuse this time ? <eos>
 A fine choice sir . <eos>
 Excellent ! <eos>
 Erysipelas . <eos>
 Not too protracted I hope . <eos>
 The Queen wishes to publish an account of him . <eos>

 You have got a couple of hours maybe . <eos>
 To do what ? <eos>

 I know that . <eos>
 But even if you were in love with me . <eos>
 You do things the hard way do not you ? <eos>
 Sometimes . <eos>

 Thanks . Lovely view you have have not you ? <eos>
 I never notice the view after the first week . <eos>
 A couple of hours . <eos>
 I have a warrant for her arrest . <eos>
 That must hurt . <eos>
 Would that make me a heel ? <eos>
 You would be breaking the law . <eos>
 Does not answer the question . <eos>
 The only answer I have for you . <eos>
 It could have been an accident . <eos>
 That COULD BE TOLD . <eos>
 Not if she knew she would not be believed . <eos>
 I tried it once . I lost my shirt . <eos>
 I buy my shirts by the dozen . Fortunately . <eos>
 I had a father who knew how to steal . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You asked me where it all came from . <eos>
 How would you know Brandon ? <eos>
 Want to walk out . or get thrown out ? <eos>
 You do not throw guests out Brandon . <eos>
 Do not bet on it . I am eccentric . <eos>
 Good afternoon Mr . Campbell . <eos>
 Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 A little something on account perhaps ? <eos>
 Rather more than a little something Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 I am afraid this s all for the moment . <eos>
 What are you doing here ? <eos>
 I do not think you locked your door . <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 Recently then . <eos>
 No Not recently . I am sure of that . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Floater ? <eos>
 Not a floater . Only just dead . <eos>
 Send that ? <eos>
 Would you ? <eos>
 What do I get for it ? <eos>
 You get it s brother . <eos>
 You in charge here ? <eos>
 So it seems Sergeant . <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 . I supposed you knew her too Inspector . <eos>
 I have met her . <eos>
 So the shell ought to have gone over ? <eos>
 Unless the gun was slanted up . <eos>
 I will know when I find it . <eos>
 I guess I am just ballast around here . <eos>
 That s pretty risky business Inspector . <eos>
 Somebody did it twice last night in the dark . <eos>
 Not too hard s it ? <eos>
 Maybe we have been pretty dumb <eos>
 Was that about the right angle ? <eos>
 I think so . <eos>
 Where s the shell ? <eos>
 Should be over there . <eos>
 Do I know who lives down there ? <eos>
 You can find out . <eos>
 This s the shell . What about the gun ? <eos>
 Well . What about it ? <eos>
 No suicide . <eos>
 Did we ever really think it was suicide ? <eos>
 May you what ? <eos>
 Oh nothing . <eos>
 Are you always this witty ? <eos>
 Scotch and plain water I think . <eos>
 Warm water no doubt . <eos>
 I never saw it before . <eos>
 Positive ? <eos>
 What about me ? <eos>
 Not quiet yet . <eos>
 You did not play it for laughs last night . <eos>
 Did you ever have a serious operation ? <eos>
 Mortar shells are not funny either . <eos>
 Not if it clears the air . <eos>
 It does . May I go now ? <eos>
 I will investigate Mr . Clarendon s financial position <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 No doubt about that one . <eos>
 How about Magruder ? <eos>
 He checks too . <eos>
 That leaves two strangers . <eos>
 So far . <eos>
 Try Betty Mayfield . The Mitchell case . <eos>
 Mayfield ? She fit into this ? <eos>
 She might . <eos>
 This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon ? <eos>
 The card says so does not it ? <eos>
 Brandon handled the money envelope . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I hear she s a very pretty girl . <eos>
 I do not know sir . <eos>
 Well find out . Who s covering her ? <eos>

 But you still think she s innocent . <eos>

 What gives Don Corleone ? <eos>
 We reinvented ourselves . <eos>
 New Hushpuppies do not make a new man . <eos>
 That explains the emptiness that haunts me . <eos>
 Jealousy s so unattractive . <eos>
 From your lips to God s ears . <eos>
 You go first . <eos>
 Ladies first . I insist . <eos>

 Whatever you want . <eos>
 Teddy I thought we were having a moment here . <eos>
 Of course we were . <eos>
 Ted ! Do something ! <eos>

 Most places are Jimmy . <eos>
 So what brings you here at his hour ? <eos>
 My new bike . <eos>
 Very funny . <eos>
 If you could just sign right there . <eos>
 You want it in writing ? <eos>
 Just a formality . <eos>
 He was my Grandfather too . <eos>

 That s a crappy thing to say . <eos>
 I have absolutely no intention <eos>
 Do it . I triple dog dare you . <eos>
 Your article sucked . <eos>

 Me ? <eos>

 Interesting . <eos>
 She said peanuts you cretin . <eos>
 You never know around here . <eos>
 Life must be peachy on Planet Ted . <eos>
 Funny you should say peachy . <eos>
 Charlie s right . Jealousy s so unattractive . <eos>
 Second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit . <eos>
 Why can not you be nice to me ? <eos>
 You have got enough people kissing your ass . <eos>
 Where are we going ? <eos>
 To the best hiding place in the world . <eos>
 He did not . He had it built . <eos>
 Whatever . <eos>
 Not whatever . It s two different things . <eos>
 He cared enough to want you to have it . <eos>
 He phoned it in . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 I doubt it . <eos>
 Your dad taught you everything . <eos>
 I mean my father . <eos>
 It s all so complicated . <eos>
 It s incredibly simple . <eos>
 Eventually you will let go . <eos>
 And then what ? <eos>
 You are amazing . <eos>

 I am very aural . <eos>
 Tell me more . <eos>
 Do you trust me Julie ? <eos>
 Not a chance . <eos>
 Come on . <eos>
 I want you to trust me . <eos>
 Maybe someday . <eos>
 That s hard to believe . <eos>
 But absolutely true . <eos>
 I know their small town mentality can be maddening . <eos>
 I mean your pictorial . It bothers me profoundly . <eos>
 You are quick . I like that . <eos>
 You think you are working with chimps here ? <eos>
 Very ambitious . I like that . <eos>
 The thing s I will need a first mate . <eos>
 Yellow pages ? <eos>

 Only the best for my mother . <eos>
 You promise you will finish school ? <eos>
 I will make you very proud . <eos>

 Forget the store . Think big . <eos>
 I never figured you for a pimp . <eos>
 Have you ever even looked at Heaven ? <eos>
 Rules are rules . <eos>

 Of course I like girls . <eos>
 A lot ? I mean a whole lot ? <eos>
