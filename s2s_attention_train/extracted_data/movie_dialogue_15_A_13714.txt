 my parents left me that house i was born there . <eos>

 i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation . <eos>
 i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess . <eos>
 it is . <eos>
 do you always open quickly ? <eos>

 you . <eos>
 each circumstance requires a different UNK . <eos>
 well i hope you remember that tomorrow when you play UNK . <eos>

 no you did not . <eos>
 i offered my help this morning and UNK turned me down . <eos>
 she could be dead after the game . <eos>
 she could be dead now . <eos>
 i do not think i could . <eos>
 it was not intentional . <eos>
 another kind of game ? <eos>
 in a way . <eos>
 this s not a game . <eos>
 do you ? <eos>

 that would hardly be proper . <eos>
 yes yes . <eos>
 ceremony ? <eos>
 NAME NAME s promotion ceremony . <eos>
 i am told that dress s the very latest fashion in london . <eos>
 women in london must have learned to not breathe . <eos>
 about the day we met . do you remember ? <eos>
 tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request . <eos>
 NAME how many times must i ask you to call me NAME ? <eos>
 at least once more miss NAME . as always . <eos>
 UNK you were a bit late . <eos>
 then we never would have met . <eos>
 i guess you can never truly know someone else s heart . <eos>

 miss NAME if you will be so kind ? <eos>
 i saved your life now you have saved mine . we are square . <eos>

 more to drink ! <eos>
 to the black NAME . <eos>
 nor did you i noticed . <eos>
 he might delay the rescue . and that would be too late . <eos>
 exactly . <eos>
 these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed . <eos>
 not if the fool has something NAME wants . something he needs . <eos>
 and you have got that have you ? <eos>
 that he is . <eos>
 she can hold a bit longer . <eos>
 we are catching up ! <eos>
 ah that s a dark and unpleasant tale best left UNK . <eos>

 that we are . <eos>
 NAME it will go worse for us for NAME especially if we fight . <eos>

 i do not think that will be necessary . <eos>

 we are bound for port royal not isla de muerta . <eos>
 they left me stranded . twice . what have you got to lose ? <eos>

 i have made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates . <eos>
 you threatened miss NAME . <eos>
 only a little . <eos>
 pirate . <eos>
 no . <eos>
 move ! <eos>
 no . i can not just step aside and let you escape . <eos>
 somewhat . <eos>
 where does it make UNK ? <eos>
 because you are a pirate . <eos>
 and you want to turn pirate yourself ? <eos>
 never . they took miss NAME . <eos>
 how ? the key s run off . <eos>
 agreed ! <eos>
 we need to go ! <eos>

 it s still against the law . <eos>
 remarkable how often those two traits coincide . <eos>
 aye ! avast ! <eos>
 my father . NAME turner ? <eos>
 i swear you look just like him . <eos>
 it s not true my father was a pirate . <eos>
 figured you would not want to hear it . <eos>

 my father was not a pirate ! <eos>
 oh did i forget to mention that ? <eos>
 do not worry . i have already got a UNK there ! <eos>

 on what ? <eos>
 i will lead them away . <eos>
 NAME ! <eos>

 it s the right way . <eos>
 the black NAME s a real ship . <eos>

 you have seen it ? <eos>
 yes . <eos>
 you have seen the black NAME ? <eos>
 yes . <eos>
 you have not seen it . <eos>
 yes i have . <eos>
 no . <eos>
 but i have seen a ship with black sails . <eos>
 like i said there s no real ship as can match hey ! <eos>
 and no lies ! <eos>
 he s not telling the truth . <eos>
 he may be . <eos>
 if he were telling truth he would not have told us . <eos>
 mentioned it s more what he did . <eos>
 still <eos>
 where did he come from ? <eos>
 an explosion in the powder magazine . merchant vessels run heavily armed . <eos>
 no . she has not . <eos>
 well she had a very UNK day . ghastly weather tonight . <eos>
 bleak . very bleak . <eos>
 a moment . <eos>
 but <eos>
 please . <eos>
 dammit man it appears someone s stealing your ship ! <eos>
 until he s done . <eos>
 dr . bright has escaped . <eos>
 dr . NAME i demand an explanation . <eos>
 come with me NAME . i want to show you something . <eos>
 no thank you . <eos>
 do ? well i suppose that depends on you . <eos>
 maybe you should but you can not . <eos>
 ai not it . <eos>
 you mean besides kicking your ass ? <eos>
 you think you can use me to stop the meltdown . <eos>
 you are not rotting meat . <eos>
 she says it s not . <eos>
 she s lying . she lost the first one on purpose . <eos>
 she did not . the mouse ran down the drain . <eos>
 she let it escape because she wants me to die . <eos>
 who cares ! we have got to find him ! hurry ! <eos>
 eventually . these things are always a matter of leverage . <eos>
 and you think o brien s that leverage ? <eos>
 that remains to be seen . <eos>
 based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable . <eos>
 do you think she loves him ? <eos>
 no icky this s real . <eos>
 icarus please ! this s important ! <eos>
 then you still love me ? <eos>
 NAME please just tell me what you want . <eos>
 i promise my dear i will give the matter some consideration . <eos>
 consideration ? <eos>
 if you honestly trust me then you will have to trust me . <eos>
 i am so excited icarus . <eos>
 considering what ? <eos>
 what i asked you earlier ? <eos>
 if you loved me like i loved you ? <eos>
 NAME this s not the time ! <eos>
 did i ? i have been waiting for that for years . <eos>
 not that . <eos>
 then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control . <eos>
 that might work . <eos>
 dr . NAME take care of them . <eos>
 the trunk . <eos>
 excellent . how long until the UNK tank s complete ? <eos>
 thank you sir . <eos>
 donated to science . perfect . <eos>
 you do not want this . <eos>

 i am a plastic man ! a plastic man ! <eos>

 the nanobot s the only thing that can stabilize the waste . <eos>

 the waste . <eos>
 what happens ? <eos>
 three days ago it was . <eos>
 what do these replicators do to people ? <eos>
 with enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else . <eos>
 that s right . <eos>
 is not it already too late then ? <eos>

 what ? what s wrong ? <eos>
 what about it ! <eos>
 just giving credit where credit s due . <eos>

 as soon as you want . <eos>
 i thought NAME said you would <eos>
 she did not know what she was talking about <eos>
 it s . whatever . that s not cool . <eos>
 that s it . <eos>
 can we maybe ask for more money on this ? <eos>
 i am only paying two of you guys . <eos>
 what s the problem ? <eos>
 nothing . <eos>
 put him through . <eos>
 no no . this s bad something might have happened we should just <eos>
 are you learning how to play the piano ? what s that ? <eos>
 are you sure ? <eos>

 i am sorry . you are right . <eos>
 i think he s weird but that s me . <eos>
 should i call you later ? <eos>
 i will just see you when you get back here . <eos>
 ok . <eos>
 i am pleased to have the new post sir . <eos>
 it s remarkable NAME . the patients are so UNK so docile . <eos>
 they have the satisfaction only a hard day s labor can provide . <eos>
 no one s forcing you to listen . <eos>
 once or twice . <eos>
 then what s he doing here ? <eos>
 now give the signal . <eos>
 . a poker . he took a poker from the fire . <eos>
 yes abbe ? <eos>
 his stinking breath caused my eyes to run that s all . <eos>
 but why must you indulge in his pornography ? <eos>
 but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence ? <eos>
 he s not the man who s cast a shadow here . <eos>
 i have you to look after me have not i ? <eos>
 turn you out ? <eos>
 NAME s not half so blind as you . <eos>
 what ? what have i done ? <eos>
 do not come back not tonight not again <eos>
 you will hate me now wo not you ? <eos>
 must not do that sir . <eos>
 i must grant him his last rites . <eos>
 i do not take my orders from you not anymore . <eos>
 you would deny a dying man his salvation ? <eos>
 it s not even noon <eos>
 i am not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption . <eos>
 do not be so sure . <eos>
 what did you do ? bribe one of the guards ? <eos>
 and ? <eos>
 our future lies in the stroke of your pen . <eos>
 mightier than the sword indeed . <eos>
 do not be absurd it s only a play . <eos>
 how can one man possibly be so selfish ? <eos>
 you always do . <eos>
 part the gates of heaven as it were <eos>
 that s enough . <eos>
 you are tense darling . you could use a long slow screw . <eos>
 good day marquis . <eos>
 then bugger me ! <eos>
 his rug . <eos>
 UNK . his wine . from now on nothing but water at every meal <eos>
 water ! <eos>
 and your meat shall be de UNK . <eos>
 because your writing continues UNK . <eos>
 a man after my own heart . <eos>
 what on earth would that require ? <eos>
 a night spent with the partner of my choice . <eos>
 you expect me to pimp NAME ? <eos>
 i was not talking about NAME . <eos>
 NAME you animal ! <eos>
 i do not mean to flirt marquis ! <eos>
 oh but you must my pumpkin ! sex without UNK s merely rape ! <eos>
 now strip . <eos>
 your wig . remove your wig . <eos>
 your words drove UNK to <eos>
 oh that s rich coming from her UNK <eos>
 i saw the longing in your eye <eos>
 that was lust <eos>
 the passion in your heart <eos>
 i know because i felt it myself <eos>
 i wanted to fuck her that s all ! <eos>
 and did you ? <eos>
 it s not your province to ask . <eos>
 why was it you never took her by force ? <eos>
 who s to say i did not ? <eos>
 was it UNK ? <eos>
 never ! <eos>
 then it must have been love <eos>
 i am here . <eos>
 surely you will grant me a final word . <eos>
 of course . <eos>
 it s a formality truly . <eos>
 a few UNK in his youth . <eos>
 his wife s influence . <eos>
 his wife s ? <eos>
 better to have an insane UNK than a criminal one . <eos>
 well . <eos>
 for sale ? to the general public ? certainly not it s UNK . <eos>
 in their eyes the marquis s the surest UNK of your progress here . <eos>
 but he s one among some two hundred wards <eos>
 and place my reputation at stake ? <eos>
 he s sworn to obedience . <eos>
 then i have friends of my own to visit . <eos>
 oh indeed ? <eos>
 of course . <eos>
 it was not inspired by circumstance . <eos>
 no . it most certainly was not . <eos>
 what could cause a UNK like this ? <eos>
 it s a weak man who tests his UNK on the backs of children <eos>
 this child let loose the beast from its cage <eos>
 you would suffer in her stead ? <eos>
 i beg you NAME do not make me say it . <eos>
 her name abbe . <eos>
 and my own . <eos>
 how s the patient UNK ? <eos>
 UNK . <eos>
 and you ? it must have been an ordeal . <eos>
 no sir . UNK put i never expect to sleep again . <eos>
 no one can fault NAME for merely bringing a man to his senses . <eos>
 maybe someday you will tell me your name . <eos>
 sweet then ? like the pastry ? <eos>
 come now darling give it a read . <eos>
 well worth the dig ! <eos>
 now s not the time to be cheeky NAME . <eos>
 do not start <eos>
 go ahead you have a key . slip it through my tiny hole . <eos>
 i suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours . <eos>
 there s something else i want from you . <eos>
 i have just the story . inspired by these very surroundings . <eos>
 most UNK . <eos>
 is it terribly erotic ? <eos>
 UNK so . <eos>
 must i administer them directly or might i blow them ? <eos>
 the price my UNK s every bit as firm as i am . <eos>
 oh you . you talk same as you write . <eos>
 the climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap . <eos>
 you demand a lot from your readers you do . <eos>
 what s that then ? <eos>
 they UNK me a savage and now they have made me one . <eos>
 it s only been described to me . in your books . <eos>
 you are far UNK than i my sweet . <eos>
 how do you propose i write it ? with dust upon the air ? <eos>
 you could whisper it through the walls of your cell . <eos>
 go on child . <eos>
 a tale more horrible than all the rest combined ! <eos>
 something to make the angels weep and the saints to UNK for air . <eos>
 no . but tell him i would . <eos>
 desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy . <eos>
 my schedule s not subject to the UNK of lunatics . <eos>
 what a beautiful thought UNK . <eos>
 what thought s that ? <eos>
 that ill gotten funds UNK of his UNK might now effect his salvation . <eos>
 words alone are UNK . <eos>
 it s beyond UNK . that honor should carry a price tag . <eos>
 and i in yours . <eos>
 NAME . can i UNK to you his UNK trick ? <eos>
 of course . <eos>
 . shame on you truly . <eos>
 to flaunt your UNK in public ? upon a stage ? <eos>
 they have put you up to this have not they ? <eos>
 you ought to court the NAME s favor not his contempt . <eos>
 but it s just begun <eos>
 do as i say . <eos>
 very much . <eos>
 you prefer a book to your husband s company ? <eos>
 no when i was but a tender lad <eos>
 last week would this be ? <eos>

 i do not like to leave questions unanswered . <eos>
 then you must spend your life answering questions . <eos>
 there are days . <eos>
 you do not live up to your reputation as an offlander NAME . <eos>
 in defense of UNK there are many more like me . <eos>
 for someone so young . <eos>
 i should warn you . i have always been attracted to older women . <eos>
 this way ! <eos>
 i thought it might begin the healing process . <eos>
 i am better . <eos>
 i understand . <eos>
 i do not . <eos>
 my power cells UNK re charge themselves . <eos>
 i can not imagine what it would be like to be a machine . <eos>

 for one thing your legs are shorter than everyone else s . <eos>
 i play the violin . and my chess UNK are quite advanced . <eos>
 no i mean . <eos>
 for what purpose ? <eos>
 androids . do not have . fun . <eos>

 your NAME used to cut quite a rug . <eos>
 they should be UNK before joining the ship s population . <eos>

 is it safe to move her ? <eos>

 NAME NAME . <eos>
 you are aboard the enterprise . <eos>

 your UNK patch turned out to be more hospitable than i expected . <eos>
 how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive . <eos>

 if we could lure him away from the bridge . <eos>
 deploy the collector . <eos>
 thank you for reminding me . <eos>
 are they . <eos>
 do you have everything you need from command ? <eos>
 i do not believe it happened that way . <eos>
 why would they fire at him without UNK ? <eos>
 his ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions . <eos>
 so you are saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong . <eos>
 it s nothing . i am just tired . <eos>
 the UNK can not handle full impulse in the patch NAME . <eos>

 you probably wo not believe me . <eos>

 i think she would cheer . <eos>
 but mr . NAME and mr . NAME <eos>
 they will do as they are told . <eos>
 of course . <eos>
 you wo not forget it ? <eos>
 i wo not forget . <eos>
 i seem to be forever thanking you for something do not i ? <eos>
 but there must be some reason something i have done without knowing . <eos>
 do not bother i can take it up myself . <eos>
 please . <eos>
 mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all . <eos>
 they certainly do not waste much time . <eos>
 nothing definite yet it s just to have lunch . <eos>
 i do not intend to be . <eos>
 ca not we sit down ? just for a minute . <eos>
 oh but there is <eos>
 and easy or not i wo not believe a word . <eos>
 why should not you ? please sit down . <eos>
 i am not crying . <eos>

 he can help you . <eos>
 something most important you can do . <eos>
 you talk just as NAME said you did . <eos>
 over my dead body . <eos>
 thank you NAME . <eos>
 how do you do mr . NAME . <eos>
 every performance ? then am i safe in assuming you like it ? <eos>
 i would like anything miss channing played . <eos>
 remembrance . <eos>
 i hope so mr . NAME . good night . <eos>
 not with you in them . not by mr . NAME . <eos>
 i wo not be a minute . <eos>
 well you have done so much . what s new ? <eos>
 the curtains . i made them myself . <eos>
 they are lovely . are not they lovely NAME ? <eos>
 very becoming . it looks better on you than it did on me . <eos>
 i have got it . <eos>
 and those checks or whatever it s for the income tax man . <eos>
 right here . <eos>
 yes dear . you forgot all about it . <eos>
 i would not like . <eos>
 i had no idea you knew each other . <eos>
 she s just outside the door . <eos>
 the heave ho . <eos>
 harrington . <eos>
 i am so sorry . harrington . wo not you sit down ? <eos>
 roughly ten minutes . <eos>
 how far to the station ? <eos>
 three or four miles . <eos>
 any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas ? <eos>
 none in sight there are not many along this back road . <eos>
 not many car either not much chance of a lift . <eos>
 it seems to me that walking for most people s not very dangerous . <eos>
 it does not matter . <eos>
 i detest cheap sentiment . <eos>
 we have all seemed a little tense lately . <eos>
 what about NAME ? <eos>
 he s in love with you . <eos>
 is not that what they always say ? <eos>
 well . <eos>
 this . i can not tell you how sorry i am ! <eos>
 with tears . <eos>
 very classy stuff lots of technique <eos>
 you will be there wo not you . <eos>
 loud . <eos>
 in a minute . <eos>
 and again and again ! two hours late for the audition to begin with <eos>
 that s on time for NAME . <eos>
 then a childish heavy handed routine about not knowing NAME was her understudy <eos>
 it s just possible she did not . <eos>
 what is ? <eos>
 just a little skid that s all . this road s like glass . <eos>
 NAME . <eos>
 NAME ? <eos>
 if we could cast it properly that is . <eos>
 now you are quoting NAME . or NAME . <eos>
 no i got the idea myself while she was talking to me . <eos>
 with UNK of course . <eos>
 it strikes me that NAME s disloyalty and UNK must be contagious ! <eos>
 they would die without each other . <eos>
 NAME ! <eos>
 i have no possible interest in anything she would have to say . <eos>
 nothing much . she apologized . <eos>
 nothing . <eos>
 did miss harrington tell you to call mr . NAME ? <eos>
 i doubt very much that you would like her in the hairy ape . <eos>
 . among so many quiet qualities . <eos>
 up in the room . <eos>
 not exactly . sometimes though i wish i understood you better . <eos>
 when you do let me in on it . <eos>
 i will . <eos>
 the play ? all right i guess . <eos>
 NAME . she s still a girl of twenty ? <eos>
 UNK . it s not important . <eos>
 do not you think it s about time it became important ? <eos>
 how do you mean ? <eos>
 do not be evasive . <eos>
 NAME you have not got any age . <eos>
 miss channing s UNK . spoken like a press agent . <eos>
 i know what i am talking about after all they are my plays . <eos>
 NAME ? NAME my understudy ? but i had no idea . <eos>
 i thought you knew . she was put on over a week ago <eos>
 i am sure . <eos>
 she was a UNK . <eos>
 to you too ? <eos>
 what do you mean ? <eos>
 in this case apparently as trustworthy as the world almanac ! <eos>
 i have no intention of having an accident ! <eos>
 it s not important whether you do . we are wearing long underwear . <eos>
 thank you NAME . godspeed . <eos>
 you know she probably means well after all . <eos>
 she s a louse . <eos>

 the UNK pole . <eos>
 no loyalty . <eos>
 no love . <eos>
 for once in my life i am not the issue . <eos>
 she will never understand it . <eos>
 in time she will . <eos>
 she will think i betrayed her . <eos>

 i am told so . <eos>
 who by ? <eos>
 sir NAME NAME tells me they are charming . <eos>
 what does he know about the highlands ? <eos>
 he has been attending at balmoral for many years . <eos>
 that does not make him an expert . <eos>
 his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject . <eos>
 i hope they did not go to any trouble NAME . <eos>
 ah well . <eos>
 to keep out the cold . <eos>
 aye . <eos>
 i heard something . <eos>
 i ordered it . it s for your own safety . <eos>

 how did you meet him ? <eos>
 he knew the immigration officer . he UNK himself in . <eos>
 he was a great boy for that . what else ? <eos>
 that s all there is . <eos>
 i would rather wait until it does matter . <eos>
 there was not any plane . <eos>
 it s always a mistake to run away . always . <eos>
 no thanks . <eos>
 bad enough . <eos>
 he could hardly help UNK you . <eos>
 that s putting it mildly . <eos>
 quarter after one . why ? <eos>
 there s a lot of night left to live through . <eos>
 let s not pretend NAME meant anything to either of us . <eos>
 certainly not to me . <eos>
 just who are you anyway ? <eos>
 is this the best you can do ? <eos>
 dance ? here ? <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 they know you here know your name . <eos>
 i did not notice him . <eos>
 we walked right passed him . he s following us . <eos>

 he s not a cop . a cop would not have kneed me . <eos>
 he was following us but he s not a policeman . <eos>
 us ? <eos>
 all right following me . <eos>

 no matter . there s nothing i can do about it . <eos>
 anything i can do about it ? <eos>
 nothing matters . <eos>
 no use waiting then . <eos>
 from you i like it . <eos>
 they are going to arrest me . <eos>
 i know . NAME has a warrant . <eos>
 i have my own warrant . stop a minute please . <eos>

 my father died in jail and he was twice the man i am . <eos>

 i can still see the shoreline . the moon s rising . <eos>
 there would be a moon tonight . <eos>
 frozen . <eos>
 if you are doing all this just for me . <eos>
 that and the fun of it . <eos>
 including NAME . i still can not think of you that way . <eos>
 if it was an accident you could have told the truth . <eos>
 so could you . but our records were a little against us . <eos>
 what your father did does not condemn you . <eos>
 you killed him ? <eos>
 mine ? <eos>
 you think NAME wants to hang beside me ? <eos>
 yes . you . you are not really a murderer yet . <eos>
 do you think i was faking ? <eos>

 would you be satisfied if i said i shot him ? <eos>

 you must come from pretty far south . <eos>
 i have never been to florida . <eos>

 you were a UNK compared to some cops i have known . <eos>
 you have had UNK with the police before ? <eos>
 who has not one way or another ? <eos>
 but not in the investigation of a major crime i hope . <eos>
 is it a crime ? <eos>
 i would like to believe that . it s not too easy . <eos>
 we try to be decent . <eos>
 if i understand what you meant by that . <eos>
 you understand perfectly . <eos>
 then there s not much i can do s there ? <eos>
 there s not anything you can do . <eos>
 i do not want to talk . <eos>
 i have come here to arrest you for murder . <eos>
 i might be able to save you . if i knew enough . <eos>
 he looks at the girl looks into her eyes <eos>

 to do what ? <eos>
 i can not answer that . <eos>

 i understand NAME . i understand perfectly . <eos>

 i am not interested in blind dates . <eos>
 i am still asking . what do you want ? <eos>

 i never notice the view after the first week . <eos>
 i have a warrant for her arrest . <eos>
 that must hurt . <eos>
 you would be breaking the law . <eos>
 does not answer the question . <eos>
 the only answer i have for you . <eos>
 do not kid me . you do not think she murdered NAME . <eos>
 it could have been an accident . <eos>
 that could be told . <eos>
 not if she knew she would not be believed . <eos>
 wait a minute . i will go with you . <eos>
 now and then . mostly just for the fun of it . <eos>
 i tried it once . i lost my shirt . <eos>
 i buy my shirts by the dozen . fortunately . <eos>
 where did it all come from ? or s that a UNK question ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you asked me where it all came from . <eos>
 the UNK lovely . the rest of the party you can have . <eos>
 lay off can not you ? <eos>
 did i do something wrong ? <eos>
 want to walk out . or get thrown out ? <eos>
 you do not throw guests out NAME . <eos>
 do not bet on it . i am eccentric . <eos>
 mr . NAME . <eos>
 a little something on account perhaps ? <eos>
 rather more than a little something mr . NAME . <eos>
 i am afraid this s all for the moment . <eos>
 oh shut up ! you have not even got your spats on . <eos>
 i do not think you locked your door . <eos>
 what do you want ? <eos>
 convenient s not it ? <eos>
 i am sorry NAME i do not know much about . <eos>

 no not recently . i am sure of that . <eos>
 thank you . <eos>

 would you ? <eos>
 how important would it have to be ? it s only murder NAME . <eos>
 men like you do not need orders . <eos>
 the joint s not open NAME . who s NAME ? <eos>

 when you sign for it you count it . it s your dough . <eos>
 so it seems NAME . <eos>
 right . <eos>
 i have met her . <eos>
 unless the gun was UNK up . <eos>
 so the wound and the shell give you the same answer . <eos>
 i guess i am just ballast around here . <eos>
 somebody did it twice last night in the dark . <eos>
 maybe we have been pretty dumb <eos>
 there was not any motive . let s try out the act . <eos>
 i think so . <eos>
 where s the shell ? <eos>
 should be over there . <eos>
 you can find out . <eos>
 you have got a dead man on your hands . like this . <eos>

 did we ever really think it was suicide ? <eos>
 oh nothing . <eos>

 did you ever have a serious operation ? <eos>
 UNK shells are not funny either . <eos>
 it does . NAME i go now ? <eos>

 perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems . <eos>
 now you are being UNK . <eos>
 how about NAME ? <eos>
 he checks too . <eos>
 that leaves two strangers . <eos>
 so far . <eos>
 try NAME mayfield . the NAME case . <eos>
 mayfield ? she fit into this ? <eos>
 she might . <eos>
 the card says so does not it ? <eos>
 NAME handled the money envelope . <eos>
 i hear she s a very pretty girl . <eos>
 which forces me to arrest her against my better UNK . <eos>
 aye . you have a point there . <eos>
 a little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either . <eos>
 well find out . who s covering her ? <eos>
 nobody s covering her i UNK the officer assigned to that duty . <eos>
 but you still think she s innocent . <eos>
 i do . <eos>
 two . <eos>
