 eventually . these things are always a matter of leverage . <eos>
 and you think o UNK s that leverage ? <eos>
 and you still believe he s going to come here ? <eos>
 based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable . <eos>
 NAME are you in one of your UNK again ? <eos>

 icarus ? <eos>

 she could have given him something to UNK his UNK . <eos>

 excellent work dr . NAME . you have UNK yourself . <eos>

 at your service NAME . <eos>
 to seal the wound he took a poker from the fire <eos>
 NAME <eos>

 i must grant him his last rites . <eos>
 i do not take my orders from you not anymore . <eos>
 care for a splash of wine abbe ? <eos>
 i am entertaining you now are not i ? <eos>
 i am not a beautiful young prospect ripe for UNK . <eos>
 yes ! it is ! the paper s cheap the type s too small <eos>
 enough to UNK its tenor . <eos>
 they can not be serious . <eos>
 our future lies in the stroke of your pen . <eos>
 you mean to take us all down with you ? <eos>
 he can not do that to me . <eos>
 i have a proposition . <eos>
 i do not know who you insult more her or me . <eos>
 part the gates of heaven as it were <eos>
 that s enough . <eos>
 you are tense darling . you could use a long slow screw . <eos>
 good day marquis . <eos>
 my bed gone ! am i to freeze to death ? <eos>
 virgin birth ha ! an entire religion built on an UNK ! <eos>
 UNK . his wine . from now on nothing but water at every meal <eos>
 water ! <eos>
 why this sudden torture ? <eos>
 if it were up to the NAME you would be UNK alive . <eos>
 i could be convinced to abandon my writing quite UNK . <eos>
 what on earth would that require ? <eos>
 a night spent with the partner of my choice . <eos>
 you expect me to pimp NAME ? <eos>
 off with your clothes ! <eos>
 NAME you animal ! <eos>
 i do not mean to flirt marquis ! <eos>
 oh but you must my pumpkin ! sex without UNK s merely rape ! <eos>
 it s a UNK UNK s not it ? power over another man . <eos>
 oh i am to be UNK now am i ? <eos>
 it s no secret that you loved her . <eos>
 oh that s rich coming from her UNK <eos>
 i saw the UNK in your eye <eos>
 that was lust <eos>
 do not confuse one organ with another <eos>
 i know because i felt it myself <eos>
 i wanted to fuck her that s all ! <eos>
 and did you ? <eos>
 go to hell ! <eos>
 why was it you never took her by force ? <eos>
 who s to say i did not ? <eos>
 was it UNK ? <eos>
 never ! <eos>
 abbe de NAME ! <eos>
 i am here . <eos>
 surely you will grant me a final word . <eos>
 of course . <eos>
 i understand he practices the very crimes he UNK in his fiction . <eos>
 why s he in your care and not a proper prison ? <eos>
 his wife s influence . <eos>
 his wife s ? <eos>
 oh . that . <eos>
 do you favor its publication ? <eos>
 shut down ? <eos>
 in their eyes the marquis s the surest UNK of your progress here . <eos>
 on the contrary . let me take up this matter with the marquis myself <eos>
 and ? <eos>
 i have . <eos>
 madame UNK mademoiselle UNK and of course the marquis wife <eos>
 it was fiction of course . <eos>
 of course . <eos>
 it was not inspired by circumstance . <eos>
 you will get more from her with kindness than you will with force . <eos>
 he will do no such thing . <eos>
 it s a weak man who tests his UNK on the backs of children <eos>
 if only blood will UNK you then shed mine . <eos>
 perhaps you will be so kind as to remind me of her name . <eos>
 i beg you NAME do not make me say it . <eos>
 my my . you have UNK my expectations . <eos>
 and my own . <eos>
 how s the patient UNK ? <eos>
 UNK . <eos>

 it s the only UNK i have left UNK . <eos>
 if only these coins purchased your other UNK too . <eos>
 your publisher says i am not to leave without a new UNK . <eos>

 a kiss for each page . <eos>
 must i UNK them directly or might i blow them ? <eos>
 the price my UNK s every bit as firm as i am . <eos>
 it s a long story this one . <eos>
 the climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap . <eos>
 the story s thrilling conclusion comes at a UNK . <eos>
 they have taken your clothes ? <eos>
 surely you have seen a man naked . <eos>
 i must say in your novels you UNK the most UNK expectations . <eos>
 it need not be not if you have another story . <eos>
 how do you propose i write it ? with dust upon the air ? <eos>
 yes that s it ! a final UNK from us both ! <eos>
 yes ! you shall . of course you shall <eos>
 a tale more horrible than all the rest combined ! <eos>
 you would do that rather than UNK our love ? <eos>
 it s UNK to write first and request an appointment <eos>
 desperation has driven me past UNK all the way to UNK . <eos>
 it s UNK money NAME . <eos>
 what a beautiful thought UNK . <eos>

 could there have been anyone else ? <eos>
 obviously there was . <eos>
 and you did not try to find out who ? <eos>
 believe me i have done everything possible short of asking NAME . <eos>
 why do you think that ? <eos>
 what s your opinion ? <eos>
 i believe NAME s different . <eos>
 so someone else could have done it . <eos>
 no . not in the eyes of the police . <eos>
 and in your eyes ? <eos>
 you do not really believe something like that happened do you ? <eos>
 it s possible s not it ? <eos>
 that s absurd ! <eos>
 that possibility never occurred to you ? <eos>
 when did you first learn about her . innocence the way she thinks ? <eos>
 shortly after she came to us . <eos>

 i do not think i care to know . <eos>
 she molested her ! <eos>
 i knew that after the fact . <eos>
 why did not you do anything to stop her ? <eos>
 because i did not know . <eos>
 and my permission ? <eos>
 we will see about that . <eos>
 do not deny it ! <eos>
 i have not decided yet . <eos>
 the woman s health s at stake . <eos>
 her spiritual health . <eos>
 i do not give a damn about her spiritual health . <eos>
 because i am a moral person . <eos>

 nice of him . <eos>
 he knew the immigration officer . he UNK himself in . <eos>
 he was a great boy for that . what else ? <eos>
 go ahead . if you want to . it does not matter . <eos>

 dance ? here ? <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 that man over there . he was in the hotel lobby . <eos>
 i did not notice him . <eos>
 then he s got to be a detective . <eos>

 you do not know who he is ? <eos>
 he s not a cop . a cop would not have UNK me . <eos>
 he was following us but he s not a policeman . <eos>
 us ? <eos>
 all right following me . <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 no matter . there s nothing i can do about it . <eos>
 it still does not matter if i kiss you ? <eos>
 nothing matters . <eos>
 so have i . <eos>
 no UNK in that . <eos>
 they are going to arrest me . <eos>
 i know . NAME has a warrant . <eos>
 take me where i have not the courage to take myself . <eos>
 i would still go through even if i ended up in jail . <eos>
 you would not like it . i have been there . <eos>
 well ? <eos>

 i can still see the UNK . the moon s rising . <eos>
 cold ? <eos>
 wonder what ? <eos>
 if you are doing all this just for me . <eos>
 including NAME . <eos>
 in a way . <eos>
 if it was an accident you could have told the truth . <eos>
 so could you . but our records were a little against us . <eos>
 not this one . and not NAME . <eos>
 and i am begging for my life and yours . <eos>
 NAME does . <eos>
 me ? <eos>
 i think you mean that . <eos>
 do you think i was faking ? <eos>

 UNK ! UNK UNK . <eos>
 i am sorry . <eos>
 stop saying you are sorry . i want information not regrets . <eos>

 do not kid me . you do not think she murdered NAME . <eos>
 it could have been an accident . <eos>
 that could be told . <eos>
 i am afraid they do . far too often . so long . <eos>
