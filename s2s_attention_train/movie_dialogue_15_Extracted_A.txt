 There s more than one way to spring a trap <eos>
 Aye so long as you are not too greedy for the bait <eos>
 On the morrow I will be awake enough to see if dreams come true <eos>
 Pray they don t turn out to be nightmares <eos>

 Worse Mrs Argon wants to talk to you She s waiting in the lab <eos>
 This day just keeps going from bad to worse <eos>
 You are looking for a urine sample <eos>
 Susan Dr Argon is giving you an opportunity here <eos>
 Opportunity ? <eos>
 It s Sim We are almost there <eos>
 Mr Sim watch out ! O Brien escaped and could be on his way ! <eos>
 Smell ? Uh something like methylcyanoacrylate <eos>
 Like Crazy Glue ? <eos>
 Yes That s it He s got it Oh God he s got it ! <eos>
 So I guess it worked <eos>
 Wellie well Dr Bright You are just in time <eos>
 What ? No kiss ? Not even for old times sake ? <eos>
 Been out for six months now <eos>
 Really ? What have you been doing ? <eos>
 You know this and that <eos>
 That s what I thought <eos>
 Susan this is the future of America here <eos>
 Daniel what are you doing here ? <eos>
 Please Susan ! I need help ! Something is wrong with me ! <eos>
 Sorry Daniel I am a physicist not a psychiatrist <eos>
 No something is really wrong look ! <eos>
 The nanobot <eos>
 Mouse ? What mouse ? <eos>
 My first organic polymerization was a lab mouse <eos>
 What happened to it ? <eos>
 I don t know <eos>
 It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment <eos>
 But you ve polymerized single celled bacteria and the fruit flies I know you have <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure <eos>
 If you don t want to do it this way I can remove it surgically <eos>
 The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste <eos>
 What waste ? <eos>
 What happens ? <eos>
 Three days ago it was <eos>
 What do these replicators do to people ? <eos>
 With enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else <eos>
 That s right <eos>
 Isn t it already too late then ? <eos>
 You are the doctor <eos>
 No no I just feel wired ! <eos>
 What ? What s wrong ? <eos>
 What about it ! <eos>
 The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl cyanoacrylate So what s wrong ? <eos>
 Yeah Old times <eos>
 I am glad you came to me for help <eos>
 Probably the caffeine <eos>
 Do you have something to bring me down ? <eos>
 No problem <eos>
 Daniel I didn t hear you come down <eos>
 The nanobot it s not here <eos>
 It s still inside me ? <eos>
 I don t know <eos>
 Getting used to it <eos>
 On the counter <eos>
 The head shrinker at the prison <eos>
 I am not leaving without you Susan ! <eos>
 Did you think I could just leave you ? <eos>
 Oh shit the meltdown It s spread to the tower <eos>
 We ve got to get the nanobot <eos>
 It s too late Argon injected it <eos>
 You mean he s polymerized like me ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 What would happen if I threw him into the core ? <eos>
 The same thing I suppose <eos>
 I have to ! <eos>
 Do the words hero fantasies mean anything to you ? How about infantile dementia ? <eos>
 I guess they do <eos>
 Forget it pissboy ! You tell Argon he can call my lawyer <eos>
 Oh yeah ? <eos>
 The question is are you ? <eos>
 It s a miracle <eos>
 Mr Sim ? Do you have him ? He s alive ? <eos>
 Oh yeah he s alive Technically <eos>
 And you have him ? <eos>
 We lost him <eos>
 Can I help you Mrs Argon ? <eos>
 You won t That s why you are whispering <eos>
 Get him Daniel ! Knock his block off ! <eos>
 Don t worry four eyes <eos>
 Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured <eos>

 Whores and pederasts ? You are better off without them <eos>
 Orvolle His wine From now on nothing but water at every meal <eos>

 Of course <eos>
 A few indiscretions in his youth <eos>
 His wife s influence <eos>
 His wife s ? <eos>
 Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 It s essential to his recovery a purgative for the toxins in his mind <eos>
 Do you favor its publication ? <eos>
 For sale ? To the general public ? Certainly not it s unprintable <eos>
 And place my reputation at stake ? <eos>
 Charenton is my life s work To have her wrested from beneath me now <eos>
 I spoke to him with reason and compassion the tools which serve us best here <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 He s sworn to obedience <eos>

 Oh you You talk same as you write <eos>
 The climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap <eos>
 You demand a lot from your readers you do <eos>
 What s that then ? <eos>
 They decreed me a savage and now they have made me one <eos>
 It s only been described to me In your books <eos>
 You are far crueler than I my sweet <eos>
 How do you propose I write it ? With dust upon the air ? <eos>
 You could whisper it through the walls of your cell <eos>
 Desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy <eos>
 My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics <eos>
 I am not a wealthy woman <eos>
 But you ve a pension haven t you from the sale of his books ? <eos>
 It s tainted money Doctor <eos>
 What a beautiful thought Marquise <eos>

 That ill gotten funds borne of his degeneracy might now effect his salvation <eos>
 And I in yours <eos>
 Doctor Can I impart to you his cruelest trick ? <eos>

 You can t ! <eos>

 I shall avenge you <eos>
 Don t play with me Kirk my hand is on the phaser control <eos>
 Give me some time to recall the data on our computers <eos>
 I give you sixty seconds Admiral <eos>
 Here it comes Now Spock <eos>
 All is well sir You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis <eos>
 First things first Captain Kill Admiral Kirk <eos>
 Just the batteries sir I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes <eos>
 We don t have minutes Can you give me phaser power ? <eos>
 A few shots sir <eos>
 I am going down to the station <eos>
 Uhura send to Commander Reliant prepare to be boarded <eos>
 I am trying sir Stand by <eos>
 Try the emergency channels <eos>
 Enterprise to Reliant Come in Reliant <eos>
 Picture Mr Saavik <eos>
 Scotty let s have it <eos>

 We will beam aboard Alert transporter room <eos>
 I had me a wee bout but Dr McCoy pulled me through <eos>
 Oh ? A wee bout of what Mr Scott ? <eos>
 He will die ! <eos>
 Admiral this is Spock <eos>
 Admiral if we go by the book like Lieutenant Saavik hours could seem like days <eos>
 I read you Captain Let s have it <eos>
 Not at present <eos>
 Right on schedule Admiral Just give us your coordinates and we will beam you aboard <eos>
 Midshipman First Class Peter Preston engineers mate SIR <eos>
 Yes SIR <eos>

 The word is given warp speed <eos>
 Aye <eos>
 The Enterprise I must check in before your inspection And you ? <eos>
 Home <eos>
 To be sure Captain <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Chekov s on Reliant isn t he ? <eos>
 It would explain a great many things <eos>
 WHO ? Who knew just where to hit us ? And u why u ? <eos>
 One thing is certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power <eos>
 Visual ! Mr Sulu divert everything to the phasers <eos>
 Too late <eos>
 Who the u hell u are they ? <eos>
 It s all we ve got <eos>
 Not much Admiral We have partial main power <eos>
 That s it ? <eos>
 Best we could do in two hours <eos>
 Steady as you go <eos>
 Uhura patch me in <eos>
 The ship out of danger ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Or the one <eos>
 Transmission jammed at the source sir <eos>
 Damn Alert Starfleet Headquarters I want to talk with Starfleet Command <eos>
 Prayer Mr Saavik The Klingons do not take prisoners Captain <eos>
 It is still regulation Admiral <eos>
 Lieutenant self expression does not seem to be one of your problems <eos>
 I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating <eos>
 You earned it <eos>
 I did not think so <eos>
 You are bothered by your performance on the u Kobayashi Maru u <eos>
 I failed to resolve the situation <eos>
 There is no correct resolution It is a test of character <eos>
 May I ask how u you u dealt with the test ? <eos>
 You may ask Lieutenant <eos>
 Humor that is a difficult concept it is not logical <eos>
 We learn by doing Lieutenant <eos>
 Take the test again <eos>
 Energize defense fields <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 HURRY <eos>
 Phasers on stun Move out <eos>
 Erased <eos>
 The u Kobayashi Maru u sir <eos>
 no uncoded messages on an open channel <eos>
 They just don t want us going in there <eos>
 At what <eos>
 All stop sir <eos>
 Descend ten thousand meters Stand by photon torpedoes <eos>
 Power levels quite low sir <eos>
 Mr Scott can you get the mains back on line ? <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 Two minutes ten seconds <eos>
 Engine room ! What s happening ? ! <eos>
 Three minutes thirty seconds <eos>
 Distance from Reliant <eos>

 Dammit Jim they ve made him into a goddam green blooded computer ! <eos>
 No way somebody has to keep an eye on him ! <eos>
 Let s hope so Bones Mr Sulu set us down in Golden Gate Park <eos>
 Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source <eos>
 Cramps <eos>
 Tearing of the middle meningeal artery <eos>
 Come on Pavel <eos>
 Pavel can you hear me ? Give me your name and rank <eos>
 Not me Bones They did it <eos>
 That is what I said Doctor <eos>
 Then how ? <eos>
 Hamlet Act I scene 4 <eos>
 No Spock It means he feels safer about your guesses than most other peoples facts <eos>
 It is <eos>
 We are just observing <eos>
 I was not informed about observers <eos>
 Reading the patient s vital signs <eos>
 Captain their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power ! <eos>
 Can you isolate the wave ? <eos>
 Negative It s impacting on all our systems ! <eos>
 Captain All systems have failed We are functioning on reserve power only <eos>
 We are out of control Rig for collision <eos>
 Yes under U S Government Now we need directions <eos>
 Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor <eos>
 That s odd Uhura what s on the Comm channels ? <eos>
 Shields aye <eos>
 May fortune favor the foolish Mr Sulu Warp Speed ! <eos>
 Sir heat shields at maximum ! <eos>
 Dr McCoy you Mr Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank <eos>
 And Admiral it s the Enterprise <eos>
 Understood What is your plan ? <eos>
 Stabilize Energy Reserve ! Report helm <eos>
 Mr Sulu switch to manual control ! <eos>
 Communicate ? Communicate what ? You have no right to be here ! <eos>
 I suppose they told you that ? <eos>
 The hell they did <eos>
 I was not <eos>
 Is there something wrong with the one I have ? <eos>
 Well that s something I da let you off right here <eos>
 How did you know Gracie s pregnant ? Nobody knows that <eos>
 It s his way <eos>
 Implicitly <eos>

 What s what ? <eos>
 You got a pocket pager ? What are you a doctor ? <eos>
 Tell me when the whales are going to be released ? <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 Who do you think I am ? <eos>
 A spaceship with a missing man <eos>
 Calm yourself Nurse Scotty get us out of here ! <eos>
 You need me <eos>
 Mr Sulu full power descent ! <eos>
 To the on board computer room To confirm my suspicion <eos>
 As suspected the Probe s transmissions are the songs sung by whales <eos>
 Whales ? <eos>
 In progress Admiral <eos>
 Uhura Get me through to Starfleet Command <eos>
 And they will be again Spock That s the beauty of it How much ? <eos>
 Ah The giants <eos>
 Thank you Spock <eos>
 Is that the logical thing to do Spock ? <eos>
 No Admiral But is the human thing to do <eos>
 Right Will you help us ? <eos>
 Admiral you must wait one damn minute <eos>
 They did Admiral <eos>
 Then Where the hell are we ? <eos>
 No data Admiral Computers are non functional <eos>
 Weapons systems ? <eos>
 Continue on course Chekov any signs of Federation escort ? <eos>
 Steady as she goes <eos>
 Mr Sulu we need breakaway speed ! <eos>
 Hang on sir Nine point seven point eight Breakaway threshold <eos>
 Steady ! ! Now Mr Sulu ! <eos>
 Aye sir ? <eos>

 We will divide into teams Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem <eos>
 Go Mr Sulu <eos>

 Everyone remember where we parked <eos>
 Nothing I should never have left him <eos>
 Uhura you did what was necessary Keep trying You will find him <eos>
 Uhura ! Where ! <eos>
 Mercy Hospital <eos>

 Put them on screen ! <eos>
 On screen <eos>
 Sir Estimating one nautical mile <eos>
 Mr Scott how soon ? <eos>
 Out of control and blind as a bat ! <eos>
 Give me one more day sir The damage control is easy Reading Klingon is hard <eos>
 About 60 feet Admiral <eos>
 That should be enough Can you enclose it to hold water ? <eos>
 I suppose I can sir are you planning to take a swim ? <eos>
 Humpbacked people ? <eos>
 Whales Scotty 45 to 50 feet long about 40 tons a piece <eos>
 Admiral how am I going to handle all that weight ? <eos>
 You will work it out Scotty And remember two of them <eos>
 Two ? <eos>
 It takes two to tango Mr Scott <eos>
 Sorry Admiral We just thought you will like to know we are beaming them now <eos>
 Oh I see Tell Them phasers on stun Good luck Kirk out <eos>
 Mr Sulu ? <eos>
 Aye But I ve never beamed up 400 tons before <eos>
 How long Scotty ? <eos>
 10 seconds Admiral 5 4 3 2 1 <eos>
 Mr Scott don t make jokes we are in danger of <eos>
 Full power sir <eos>
 Mr Sulu if you please <eos>
 The beasties seem happy to see you Doctor I hope you like our little aquarium <eos>
 On my way ! <eos>
 No power to the bay doors <eos>
 The explosive override ? <eos>
 It s under water ! There s no way to reach it <eos>
 Go on ahead Close the hatch ! <eos>
 Admiral you will be trapped ! <eos>
 Scotty don t prejudge A ship is a ship <eos>
 I demand to see the owners ! I demand <eos>
 Well that s different <eos>
 If you will follow me Professor <eos>
 I will Can my assistant come too ? <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 Just use the keyboard <eos>
 The keyboard How quaint <eos>
 That s the ticket laddie <eos>
 But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix ! <eos>
 Hi Huey 205 isn t it ? <eos>
 Right on You fly ? <eos>
 Oh here and there I flew something similar in my Academy days <eos>
 All right then this is old stuff to you <eos>
 Old yes But interesting Do you mind if I ask a few questions ? <eos>
 Capability yes But where can warp drive take us except away from here ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I don t like to leave questions unanswered <eos>
 Then you must spend your life answering questions <eos>
 This way ! <eos>
 I thought it might begin the healing process <eos>
 You are what ? <eos>
 I am better <eos>
 I understand <eos>
 I don t <eos>
 My power cells continually re charge themselves <eos>
 I can t imagine what it would be like to be a machine <eos>
 Tournel will take you the rest of the way <eos>
 No I want to stay with you <eos>
 It is safer there I will join you shortly <eos>
 Bye <eos>
 Data doesn t breathe <eos>
 Won t he rust ? <eos>
 No <eos>
 Your Captain used to cut quite a rug <eos>
 They should be quarantined before joining the ship s population <eos>
 Yes But look at this medscan <eos>
 Is it safe to move her ? <eos>
 Safer than leaving her here <eos>
 Captain Geordi ? <eos>
 You are aboard the Enterprise <eos>
 How about a passive radiation scan ? <eos>
 It is clearly Federation in origin Captain <eos>
 Just a few loose ends to tie up <eos>
 What you are seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields <eos>
 What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except to deceive the Ba ku <eos>
 I don t know <eos>
 Good Let s begin to move these people out <eos>
 Another forty three people reported taken sir <eos>
 Will the structure hold if we blast through ? <eos>
 I believe it is safe sir <eos>
 He s right Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies <eos>
 Picard s first officer Do you really believe he will listen ? <eos>
 In six hours every living thing in this system will be dead or dying <eos>
 It is not over <eos>
 It is over <eos>
 There s nothing further to be gained from this <eos>
 Scan for lifesigns <eos>
 Recommendations ? <eos>
 Do you have everything you need from command ? <eos>
 When I was an ensign I could detect a three micron mis alignment <eos>
 It s nothing I am just tired <eos>
 I think it s the universal greeting when you don t like someone <eos>
 Options ? <eos>
 Eject the core <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 On screen <eos>
 Eject the core <eos>
 Commander if one of their weapons hits that gas <eos>
 It s our only way out of here Mister Nara <eos>
 How long til they reach us ? <eos>
 Eighteen minutes <eos>
 Remind me to lodge a protest <eos>
 We are through running from these bastards <eos>
 Blow out the ramscoop Stand by full thrusters <eos>
 Deck ten <eos>
 Commander Riker <eos>
 We are not going anywhere <eos>
 You Klingons never do anything small do you <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 Go back to your quarters That s an order <eos>
 Ask them <eos>
 I am afraid there s too much bitterness on both sides <eos>
 Slow to impulse We are on our way <eos>
 We will skip the court martial this time Picard out <eos>
 Yes yes I can hear you <eos>
 We are trying to get to you sir <eos>
 We are coming as fast as we can we can t risk using phasers <eos>
 I understand Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready <eos>
 Worf what the hell are you doing here ? <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Hmm ? Oh it s just something my mother used to <eos>
 Beam him out ! <eos>
 Prepare to enter the atmosphere we will use the ionospheric boundary to shake him <eos>
 Evasive maneuvers heading one four zero mark three one <eos>
 Transferring controls to manual <eos>
 No sir <eos>
 Debrief them again Have you been in a fight Commander ? <eos>
 No sir It is a gorch <eos>
 Gorch ? <eos>
 Picard to Crusher <eos>
 No We will be responsible for that Mister Worf <eos>
 Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak tahla <eos>
 We have to find shelter <eos>
 Decloak the holo ship and engage a tractor beam Mister Worf <eos>
 Can you beam him off ? <eos>
 Negative He s established a security field around the control room <eos>
 Is there any other way to disable the injector ? <eos>
 Say the greeting again <eos>
 Yew cheen chef faw emphasis on the cheen and the faw <eos>
 What are they interested in ? <eos>
 Wine women and song <eos>
 You should feel right at home with them <eos>
 Good question <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 What you are doing to my neck <eos>
 Was I doing something to your neck ? <eos>
 But it s comfortable <eos>
 Why don t you try sitting up ? <eos>
 Or you could try lying down <eos>
 You are in quite a mood today <eos>
 I believe you <eos>
 I am not sleeping well <eos>
 Doctor Crusher has something that will take care of that <eos>
 Augh ? <eos>
 I never kissed you with a beard before <eos>
 And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up ? <eos>
 Activating injector assembly <eos>
 Sir I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels <eos>
 Your scanners must be malfunctioning <eos>
 All ship functions are off line <eos>
 They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here <eos>
 Isolate one and re route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor <eos>
 Montana ? Well that answers everything Why the hell are we <eos>
 I will be fine He s a different story <eos>
 It was an experience Metal scalpels needle and thread <eos>
 At least four hours <eos>
 Um yeah Now he s going to need a respirator Do you have one ? <eos>
 We have two but we don t have the juice to run them <eos>
 Bag him <eos>
 Intelligence ambition desire I bring order to chaos <eos>
 It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference <eos>
 I do not know what you are referring to <eos>
 That s because you haven t been properly stimulated yet <eos>
 They are not your friends they ve held you back kept you from your destiny <eos>
 That is not true They have tried to help me <eos>
 Have they given you what I have given you ? Did they even try ? <eos>
 I do not want this <eos>
 Then take the final step give me the Enterprise and we can be together always <eos>
 No no please you cannot <eos>
 Yes but the Enterprise my duty <eos>
 is to yourself Don t make me hurt you again <eos>
 And I need to control this ship Let me into your mind <eos>
 Vulcan ? <eos>
 No <eos>
 Bring us about Target Borg ship alpha four port side battery <eos>
 Ready quantum torpedo <eos>
 Where s the Sphere ? <eos>
 Contact Starfleet Command <eos>
 According to our astrometric readings the year is 2063 <eos>
 Doctor Crusher has been studying some advanced medical theories <eos>
 I told you there s no <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Outside around back Next to the water tank <eos>
 Oh just a little tinkering How is he ? <eos>
 Let s go <eos>
 There should be an access hatch nearby <eos>
 I have the password right here <eos>
 There should be some kind of manual release <eos>
 It could be the radiation Captain Try from the surface <eos>
 Always am <eos>
 Phoenix to control Initiating five minute countdown mark <eos>
 Tell her to go back to Resurrection <eos>
 She s a very determined woman Phoenix to control Mister Lange let her in <eos>
 This is Picard I ve suspended the launch sequence <eos>
 As they used to say all systems are go <eos>
 I am on it <eos>
 Picard to Enterprise Picard to Enterprise do you read me ? <eos>
 We are crossing the threshold ! <eos>
 Active <eos>
 Main bus <eos>
 Ready <eos>
 Initiate pre ignition sequence <eos>
 Oh here and there You know how it is <eos>
 Not really I was born and raised right here Never had much use for travel <eos>
 California San Francisco <eos>
 Beautiful city Used to be anyway I didn t think anyone still lived there <eos>
 There s a few of us left <eos>
 Something wrong with that ? <eos>
 Not yet <eos>
 Wrong answer Mister Picard Try again <eos>
 And you know all this because U you are U a space man too <eos>
 I am afraid you ve caught me I am a space man <eos>
 Yes he is <eos>
 No not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be <eos>
 How did you know about that ? <eos>
 Don t flatter yourself I take pictures of a lot of junk <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 On screen <eos>
 Population thirty five billion All Borg <eos>
 Western hemisphere North American continent <eos>
 Fire <eos>
 Data set a course for that vortex <eos>
 Steady as she goes <eos>
 Fire ! <eos>
 Onscreen <eos>
 Worf torpedo now ! <eos>
 They did it they assimilated Earth <eos>
 We are still in Earth orbit <eos>
 On screen <eos>
 Life signs ? <eos>
 Can t tell Long range bio sensors are off line <eos>
 I will keep in contact You have the Bridge <eos>
 Yes sir <eos>
 Then make it so Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex ? <eos>
 Unless you d like to stay <eos>
 No sir <eos>
 Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid Admiral Hayes <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room <eos>
 They appear to be modifying the deflector dish <eos>
 Computer thermal enhancement <eos>
 They are converting the deflector dish into an antennae <eos>
 Agreed Options ? <eos>
 Destroy the deflector dish <eos>
 Understood ! <eos>
 We ve lost Bridge control ! <eos>
 Emergency override ! <eos>
 Nothing <eos>
 Do we have any idea how many Borg we are dealing with ? <eos>
 Where the hell are they going ? <eos>
 What are you suggesting ? <eos>
 I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll <eos>
 Hold that thought <eos>
 Riker here <eos>
 There s a dampening field in place on this deck Our tricorders are useless <eos>
 Any sign of Data or the Borg themselves ? <eos>
 Something is very wrong Commander We are falling back <eos>
 Commander we have a problem <eos>
 Target <eos>
 Data s positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise Command codes security protocols <eos>
 I am going too They may need a doctor <eos>
 The charge is murder <eos>
 You may need assistance doctor <eos>
 Fascinating <eos>
 Vulcans sleep lying down <eos>
 We DO sleep lying down <eos>
 Thank you nurse Jim she s ready ! Lock and load ! <eos>
 We WERE beginning to hit our stride together doctor <eos>
 That s the question <eos>
 You heard the order Lieutenant <eos>
 I wish I knew Uhura ? <eos>
 Can you ? <eos>
 Jim I don t even know his anatomy <eos>
 Chancellor Gorkon can you hear me ? Chancellor ? <eos>
 What s the Brotherhood of Aliens ? <eos>
 We ve been set up all along <eos>
 We are not finished <eos>
 Speak for yourself One day one night <eos>
 Still think we are finished ? <eos>
 More than ever <eos>
 Don t remind me <eos>
 No way You see this ? <eos>
 Killed trying to escape it s a classic <eos>
 Come on <eos>
 And perhaps with a large step or two Like a peace treaty <eos>
 Starfleet s killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of exploration <eos>
 Captain shall we attempt to return fire ? <eos>
 In space no one can hear you sweat <eos>
 We were until your torpedoes ! <eos>
 Then let me help ! <eos>
 Aside from a touch of arthritis I d say pretty good <eos>
 Barely <eos>
 Have you saved patients as barely alive as he was ? <eos>
 You say you are due for retirement May I ask do your hands shake ? <eos>
 That s a comfort <eos>
 I am not sure how to take that <eos>
 Very much <eos>
 How can I trust <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Spoken by you ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Louder please We cannot hear you <eos>
 Those words WERE spoken by me <eos>
 Your honors the State rests <eos>
 Captain Sulu on assignment anyone seen Spock ? <eos>
 Full diplomatic courtesy Mr Chekov <eos>
 I know what you mean <eos>
 Uhura monitor ! <eos>
 Torpedo bay ! DID we fire those torpedoes ? <eos>
 Who else ? <eos>
 She s only a cog in the wheel no way she knows that <eos>
 Shields up Battle stations <eos>
 Aye sir thrusters <eos>
 Aye sir thrusters <eos>
 Second star to the right and straight on till morning <eos>
 Shields up Captain ? <eos>
 They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here <eos>
 This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory <eos>
 Now we go to Starfleet ? <eos>
 Now we expand our search to include uniforms <eos>
 ALL uniforms ? <eos>
 Mr Valtane any more data ? <eos>
 Onscreen <eos>
 Do we report this sir ? <eos>
 Are you kidding ? Send to Starfleet Command <eos>
 We will make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours <eos>
 I shall look forward to it <eos>
 We must do this again soon <eos>
 Give a girl a chance Captain <eos>
 They will be here <eos>
 I like it here <eos>
 Kill him ! He s the one ! ! <eos>
 Not me idiot HIM ! <eos>
 He s got it <eos>
 And your coat <eos>
 Fraid not It wouldn t fit him anyway <eos>
 Krandog aranty <eos>
 There s a reward for your death <eos>
 We didn t kill Gorkon <eos>
 Of course not Anyway somebody up there wants you out of the way <eos>
 Don t you know ? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life <eos>
 Anything else you want to tell me ? <eos>
 Except us <eos>
 It IS possible <eos>
 Energize <eos>
 Captain if <eos>
 Stand DOWN Mr Scott All stop That s an order <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 WHO ELSE ? <eos>
 Saavik sir We were told you d need a helmsman so I volunteered <eos>
 Thank you Lieutenant one quarter impulse power <eos>
 Captain may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock ? <eos>
 Plot a course for Kronos Lieutenant <eos>
 Kronos sir ? <eos>
 I am still in the chair Lieutenant <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 Come on Saavik you COULD knock <eos>
 We are almost at the rendezvous I thought you d want to know <eos>
 Right <eos>
 Right standard rudder Z plus five degrees <eos>
 Captain <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Mr Chekov anything unusual ? <eos>
 Uhura signal our surrender <eos>
 You hear that ? <eos>
 You have personally <eos>
 The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal <eos>
 Far be it for me to dispute my first officer Starfleet has always <eos>
 I am uncertain <eos>
 Spock I am really tired <eos>
 We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Curiously it appears to emanate from us <eos>
 From Enterprise ? <eos>
 We ve fired on the Chancellor s ship <eos>
 According to the data bank we HAVE twice <eos>
 He was just about to explain the whole damn <eos>
 Why would they give them to us ? <eos>
 The Commander is an old friend of yours <eos>
 Not yet Section 4236 <eos>
 Probably trying to figure out why we are reversing wondering if we detect her <eos>
 is to trust him <eos>
 Control this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart <eos>
 This is the Starship Enterprise Captain James Kirk commanding <eos>
 WE SURRENDER <eos>
 This is Enterprise We surrender Repeat Enterprise surrenders <eos>
 Who else ? <eos>
 Nothing Captain If they are here they are rigger for silent running <eos>
 Not from a distance She won t show up on ANY type of scan <eos>
 Faith ? <eos>
 That the universe will unfold as it should <eos>
 Such things have happened before sir <eos>
 An error <eos>
 I don t want to <eos>
 I believe you Please <eos>
 Confirmed Captain ! <eos>
 Fifty four planets and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well <eos>
 Then it s time we were heading home Three years is <eos>
 Visual ! <eos>
 What is it ? <eos>
 I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis <eos>
 What s left of it <eos>
 Mr Scott you forget yourself Please accompany me <eos>
 Yet the data banks insist we fired twice One computer is lying <eos>
 A computer canna lie sir <eos>
 I think not <eos>
 You can check the torpedoes visually if you like <eos>
 We will have to check every one of them Mr Scott <eos>
 That could take hours ! <eos>
 Nevertheless <eos>
 And if they are still in place ? <eos>
 Then someone forged a data bank entry <eos>
 I know precisely where he will be <eos>
 There was an enormous neutron energy surge <eos>
 Not from us ! <eos>
 If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would ve seen her ! <eos>
 Would they ? <eos>
 This one can <eos>
 They you are talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction Mr Spock <eos>
 I believe I am <eos>
 Aye aye sir <eos>
 How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice ? <eos>
 He s placing himself in a most awkward position <eos>
 Maybe we should write them a letter ? <eos>
 But you didn t join a conspiracy <eos>
 You are me <eos>
 No My name is Data I am your brother <eos>
 I am in a room with lights <eos>
 No <eos>
 No <eos>
 Is that your final answer ? <eos>
 No I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because you are dangerous <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship <eos>
 I do not understand <eos>
 I know <eos>
 No <eos>
 Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship ? <eos>
 No Can I move now ? <eos>
 No I must deactivate you <eos>
 For how long ? <eos>
 Indefinitely <eos>
 How long is that ? <eos>
 About twenty five years ago They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell <eos>
 I think a skin cell s the more likely of the two <eos>
 You are working late <eos>
 He was a bit proud as I recall <eos>
 He was a damn fool Selfish and ambitious Very much in need of seasoning <eos>
 He turned out all right <eos>
 Can you describe it Deanna ? <eos>
 I can t be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating <eos>
 To happy endings <eos>
 Thank you Data Let s see what she can do <eos>
 Mister Worf accompany Data please <eos>
 I can see that <eos>
 Sorry sir <eos>
 Aye sir This way <eos>
 It would appear so <eos>
 Port thrusters sir Would you like me to drive ? <eos>
 We are about to find out Power up disruptors and fire on my mark <eos>
 Ready Captain <eos>
 Fire ! <eos>
 At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes <eos>
 Full axis rotation to port ! Fire all ventral phasers ! <eos>
 Divert power and compensate <eos>
 Deanna stand by Open a channel <eos>
 Negative <eos>
 Sir <eos>
 You are not looking at your self You are looking at me <eos>
 You do not look like me <eos>
 This is not an appropriate time for a conversation <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Emergency force fields are holding <eos>
  <eos>
 Why is it moving ? <eos>
 Like me it has been designed with modular power sources <eos>
 The resemblance is striking <eos>
 I would like to pick you up now May I do that ? <eos>
 Thank you <eos>
 With pleasure Captain <eos>
 Do you have a moment sir ? <eos>
 Of course sit down <eos>
 And I you <eos>
 I know how he thinks <eos>
 Counselor ? <eos>

 God I am hungry <eos>
 I don t know I am getting these u CRAMPS u ! <eos>
 u OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD u ! <eos>
 I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin <eos>
 A transmission ? <eos>
 A voice transmission <eos>
 Play it for us please <eos>
 Unknown <eos>
 What ? u Why u ? <eos>
 I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise <eos>
 It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man <eos>
 I have a temporary sequence on the monitor <eos>
 Hold it I can t hear a damn thing ! <eos>
 Has the hull been breached ? <eos>
 Hard to say <eos>
 Well get started <eos>
 Right Talk to you <eos>
 Yeah ! <eos>
 How s it coming on the engines ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Not u they u u he u <eos>
 Machine s screwed up I can t tell Needle s spinning all over the dial <eos>
 That way <eos>
 Bulbs burned out nobody bothered to replace em <eos>
 All over the ship we will have to check the charts to know for sure <eos>
 Dead <eos>
 Dead ! <eos>
 It s monstrous it grew like some horrible tapeworm We were completely unprepared <eos>
 It s still in the ship ? <eos>
 Is it alive ? <eos>
 What was that ? What the Christ was that ? <eos>
 The water will still recycle <eos>
 Well I am going to have to blow the engines out <eos>
 And when will you be ready to do that ? <eos>
 Oh I am not near ready yet <eos>
 Then why the hell are you sitting around here ? <eos>
 Right <eos>
 Here let me try <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 The engines are fixed <eos>
 Just hold us together till we are in space that s all ! <eos>
 I hope not <eos>
 Poison gas <eos>
 Meet us on the bridge Be careful it s u huge u now <eos>
 Right <eos>
 Right <eos>
 And be right back <eos>
 u He s u the only one that knows that <eos>
 How does he breathe ? <eos>
 Yeah but how ? His nose and mouth are blocked <eos>
 It s eating a hole in the floor ! <eos>
 But this thing uses it for u blood u <eos>
 Hell of a defense mechanism You don t dare kill it <eos>
 Isn t there some way we can get it off him ? <eos>
 You can t tell that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits <eos>
 We d be sitting ducks in the freezers <eos>
 Boy that s terrific <eos>
 Well how does it feel to be rich men ? <eos>
 It wouldn t come <eos>
 Ask him <eos>
 Careful don t get under it ! <eos>
 I will come with you <eos>
 The door was closed It must still be in here <eos>
 How s Broussard ? <eos>
 He s running a fever <eos>
 Still unconscious ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Can you do anything for him ? <eos>
 The machine will bring his temperature down His vital functions are strong <eos>
 Good <eos>
 Sounds like a rough one <eos>
 Got a better idea ? <eos>
 At least it can t get up here now <eos>
 Oh my God <eos>
 Does anybody know what happened ? <eos>
 The flamethrower needs more fuel <eos>
 Right We ve got a lot to accomplish Let s get moving <eos>
 Should we go outside and bring him in ? <eos>
 No the risk is too great Perhaps after we ve destroyed the thing <eos>
 What we really need is some red meat in here for bait <eos>
 Let me go first you stay behind me <eos>
 I can t the acid will pour out ! <eos>
 I ve completely lost their signal <eos>
 Can you get them back ? <eos>
 I am trying <eos>
 How many ? <eos>
 Three blips ! They are coming this way ! <eos>
 Jay this is Cleave ! Meet me at the main air lock ! <eos>
 I guess I had it coming Let s call it settled <eos>
 I think it s fizzled out <eos>
 Hey ! what about the film ? <eos>
 Listen hadn t somebody better check on Broussard ? <eos>
 It was horrible horrible Like a chicken <eos>
 We sure need this flamethrower <eos>
 And the creature with it We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat <eos>
 Feast your eyes <eos>
 Sandy can you home in on that beam ? <eos>
 What s the frequency ? <eos>
 Computer what s the frequency of the transmission ? <eos>
 You lead <eos>
 My signal s fading <eos>
 How far ? <eos>
 We should be almost on top of it I just can t quite <eos>
 Who knows ? <eos>
 That creature sure must have considered it important using his last strength to draw it <eos>
 Can t tell these weather conditions could erode anything fast <eos>
 I couldn t make it out too much interference <eos>
 Is it still coming up or is it hooked on something ? <eos>
 No it s coming <eos>
 Can you see anything ? <eos>
 u Don t touch him watch it u ! <eos>
 Help me I am going to try to get it off <eos>
 Let s let the machine work on him <eos>
 Is it still dripping ? <eos>
 It appears to have healed itself <eos>
 We are going into the freezers now <eos>
 Room by room corridor by corridor <eos>
 Are they close ? <eos>
 They are on the next level up <eos>
 Let s get moving with this net <eos>
 Just a second Those aren t water vapor clouds they have no moisture content <eos>
 Close <eos>
 That tube must be depositing it in him <eos>
 Could be some kind of venom or poison <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 They never made it off the planet The parasites won <eos>
 Sandy contact traffic control <eos>
 Well it s finally happened <eos>
 No that s atmosphere Cloud layer <eos>
 Turn on navigation lights <eos>
 Engine room what happened ? <eos>
 Sandy how far are we from the source of the transmission ? <eos>
 Good I am getting you clear too Let s just keep the line open <eos>
 Found what ? <eos>
 It appears to be some sort of spacecraft We are going to approach it <eos>
 I agree This is the single most important discovery in history <eos>
 But ? <eos>
 What killed it ? <eos>
 I don t even know what I am looking for <eos>
 Still worried ? <eos>
 Oh well you know me <eos>
 I ve always respected your opinion Martin If something worries you it worries me <eos>
 Tell you what Martin As soon as the engine s fixed <eos>
 We are coming up now open the outer lock door <eos>
 Chaz what happened to Broussard ? <eos>
 It s some kind of organism it s attached itself to him Let us in <eos>
 Good <eos>
 Is that its mouth ? <eos>
 Up one kilometer Jay <eos>
 Let s take her into an escape orbit <eos>
 You bet we made it Martin set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive <eos>
 With great pleasure <eos>
 It started crashing around right after we locked it in <eos>
 Now what ? <eos>
 I guess we open the door and net it <eos>
 Go ahead Jay <eos>
 What do you think ? Now we go in <eos>
 Let s be democratic <eos>
 By eating our food supplies <eos>
 What s that supposed to mean ? <eos>
 Nothing <eos>
 More spores coming <eos>
 It s stable it doesn t hurt to drop it <eos>
 Who gets the privilege ? <eos>
 What did it do to you ? <eos>
 Look <eos>

 Do you want an argument or an answer ? <eos>
 An answer <eos>
 No <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Now you want an argument <eos>
 She works hard <eos>
 Night an day <eos>
 She s loyal and efficient <eos>
 Like an agent with one client <eos>
 She thinks only for me doesn t she ? <eos>
 Well let s say she thinks only about you anyway <eos>
 How do you mean that ? <eos>
 Miss Harrington <eos>

 They certainly don t waste much time <eos>
 Nothing definite yet it s just to have lunch <eos>
 Don t get up And don t act as if I were the queen mother <eos>
 I don t expect you to be pleasant <eos>
 I don t intend to be <eos>

 I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you d seen the play <eos>
 Roughly ten minutes <eos>
 How far to the station ? <eos>
 Three or four miles <eos>
 Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas ? <eos>
 None in sight there aren t many along this back road <eos>
 Not many car either not much chance of a lift <eos>
 It seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous <eos>
 I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down <eos>
 Be brave He will come back with or without gas <eos>
 It doesn t matter <eos>
 I detest cheap sentiment <eos>
 You will be there won t you <eos>
 Loud <eos>
 In a minute <eos>
 Just a little skid that s all This road s like glass <eos>
 Margo ! <eos>
 I have no possible interest in anything she d have to say <eos>
 Nothing much She apologized <eos>
 Nothing <eos>
 Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr Richards ? <eos>
 I doubt very much that you d like her in The Hairy Ape <eos>
 Among so many quiet qualities <eos>
 What is he talking about ? <eos>

 Up in the room <eos>
 Too many And you ve got a new guest A movie star from Hollywood <eos>

 Satisfied Wiseass ? <eos>

 The cop in the trunk he could still be alive <eos>
 That s a reasonable possibility <eos>
 He might ve heard everything we said in the car <eos>
 What s your point ? <eos>
 We can t leave him to repeat anything <eos>

 So does Elliot <eos>
 Not one of Steven s finer moments <eos>
 Oh You know him <eos>
 A little <eos>
 And he has finer moments now and then <eos>
 He has something A funny little quality I find <eos>
 Endearing <eos>
 Engaging <eos>
 Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike <eos>
 A little drastic maybe ? <eos>
 Say it again <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You know what <eos>
 Alla puttanesca <eos>

 You grow fond of him That s good <eos>
 Don t play God with me Aramis I <eos>
 But what is Porthos doing ? <eos>
 Going into the barn naked or so it appears <eos>
 But what is he doing ? <eos>
 About to hang himself I should think <eos>
 The mask is terrifying especially when unexpected Do you notice ? <eos>
 All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal <eos>
 Hold your goblet with two fingers <eos>
 We can t stay here That traitor d Artagnan knows about this place <eos>
 To the Bastille And death <eos>
 Aramis the King wishes to see you <eos>
 Still you serve him loyally though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem <eos>

 We will make our own luck tonight if Phillippe holds up <eos>
 Bread and wine in that cupboard <eos>

 Better grab up some sand to take home to your family <eos>
 Oh God <eos>
 No please not again <eos>
 We are going to keep driving <eos>
 Wha <eos>
 Oh Jesus they ve stopped <eos>
 We shouldn t have been here Epps There is a war going on ! <eos>
 This is miles from the battle lines They were probably deserters <eos>
 Deserters would have run they wouldn t have engaged <eos>
 They shouldn t have been out this way that s all I am saying <eos>
 Low on gas Got to refill <eos>
 Him getting us stranded out here doesn t do much good either <eos>
 For climbing <eos>
 Break it out <eos>
 Yeah <eos>
 The soldiers are going to kill those people ! <eos>
 Let me see the map <eos>
 What do you figure it to be ? <eos>
 Got to be some kind of landmark something distinctive <eos>
 So we wait <eos>
 Move ! <eos>
 I heard ! <eos>
 All right I will go up then you send up the gold and <eos>
 I told you He tried to steal our gold He tried to kill us <eos>
 I told you don t push me around <eos>
 He s an enemy soldier <eos>
 I am not going to let you kill him <eos>
 We are at war <eos>
 Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand <eos>
 Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge <eos>
 And let me guess who is <eos>
 I have to answer him <eos>
 So you can give us away ? <eos>
 If I don t answer he will know something s up <eos>
 If I give it to you will you let us go ? <eos>

 I am the one who can feel my leg and it s falling asleep <eos>
 It falls asleep and you die so wake it the hell up <eos>
 It s the treasure that s what it is <eos>
 Just figure it s my map I ought to hang on to it <eos>
 Shut up and listen ! <eos>
 It s a fire fight <eos>
 Single shots doesn t mean a fire fight That s not a battle going on <eos>
 What are they doing here ? <eos>
 The Shi ites are on our side ? I didn t know that <eos>
 Something like that <eos>
 But the white dot in the middle that s got to mean something <eos>
 I hope it means something otherwise <eos>
 Stay low <eos>

 Is it all right if I stand up ? <eos>

 He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 He believed the key to self knowledge was emotion not logic <eos>
 Fascinating <eos>
 That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City <eos>
 To land any closer would risk detection <eos>
