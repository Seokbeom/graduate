 She undressed alone she bathed alone <eos>
 Is that normal ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Who was the father ? <eos>

 What man had access to her ? <eos>
 None as far as I know <eos>
 Was there a priest ? <eos>
 Yes but I <eos>
 Could there have been anyone else ? <eos>
 What s your opinion ? <eos>
 I believe Agnes is different <eos>
 So someone else could have done it <eos>
 No not in the eyes of the police <eos>
 And in your eyes ? <eos>
 It s possible isn t it ? <eos>
 That s absurd ! <eos>
 Shortly after she came to us <eos>
 And you weren t shocked ? <eos>

 Where is she ? <eos>
 Hasn t she had enough ? <eos>
 I have a few more questions to ask her <eos>
 Who knew she was pregnant ? <eos>
 Why do you insist upon pressing <eos>
 Was it you ? <eos>
 Is it because she s a nun ? <eos>
 Did you know she was pregnant ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 And you didn t send her to a doctor <eos>
 I didn t guess until it was too late <eos>
 For what ? An abortion ? <eos>
 Oh don t be ridiculous <eos>
 Too late for what ? <eos>
 I don t know too late to stop it <eos>
 The baby ? <eos>
 She didn t want any help <eos>
 You wanted that child out of the way <eos>
 That s a lie <eos>
 And the baby <eos>
