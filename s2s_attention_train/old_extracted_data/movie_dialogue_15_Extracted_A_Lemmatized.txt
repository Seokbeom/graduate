 the chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal <eos>
 far be it for me to UNK my first officer starfleet ha always <eos>
 i am UNK <eos>
 NAME i am really tired <eos>
 we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation <eos>
 where ? <eos>
 UNK it appears to UNK from u <eos>
 from enterprise ? <eos>
 we ve fired on the chancellor s ship <eos>
 according to the data bank we have twice <eos>
 he wa just about to explain the whole damn <eos>
 why would they give them to u ? <eos>
 the NAME is an old friend of yours <eos>
 not yet section UNK <eos>
 probably trying to figure out why we are UNK wondering if we detect her <eos>
 is to trust him <eos>
 control this is enterprise requesting permission to UNK <eos>
 this is the starship enterprise NAME NAME NAME commanding <eos>
 we surrender <eos>
 this is enterprise we surrender repeat enterprise surrender <eos>
 who else ? <eos>
 nothing NAME if they are here they are UNK for silent running <eos>
 not from a distance she won t show up on any type of scan <eos>
 NAME ? <eos>
 that the universe will UNK a it should <eos>
 such thing have happened before sir <eos>
 an error <eos>
 i don t want to <eos>
 i believe you please <eos>
 confirmed NAME ! <eos>
 fifty four planet and their UNK atmospheric anomaly our UNK and UNK equipment worked well <eos>
 then it s time we were heading home three year is <eos>
 visual ! <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 i cannot confirm the existence of praxis <eos>
 what s left of it <eos>
 mr NAME you forget yourself please accompany me <eos>
 yet the data bank insist we fired twice one computer is lying <eos>
 a computer canna lie sir <eos>
 i think not <eos>
 you can check the torpedo UNK if you like <eos>
 we will have to check every one of them mr NAME <eos>
 that could take hour ! <eos>
 nevertheless <eos>
 and if they are still in place ? <eos>
 then someone forged a data bank entry <eos>
 i know precisely where he will be <eos>
 there wa an enormous neutron energy surge <eos>
 not from u ! <eos>
 if another ship had been beneath u the klingons would ve seen her ! <eos>
 would they ? <eos>
 this one can <eos>
 they you are talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction mr NAME <eos>
 i believe i am <eos>
 aye aye sir <eos>
 how do both side overcome UNK prejudice ? <eos>
 he s placing himself in a most awkward position <eos>
 maybe we should write them a letter ? <eos>
 but you didn t join a conspiracy <eos>
 you are me <eos>
 no my name is NAME i am your brother <eos>
 i am in a room with light <eos>
 no <eos>
 no <eos>
 is that your final answer ? <eos>
 no i have only activated your UNK and communication UNK <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 because you are dangerous <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship <eos>
 i do not understand <eos>
 i know <eos>
 no <eos>
 do you have any knowledge of the tactical UNK of this ship ? <eos>
 no can i move now ? <eos>
 no i must deactivate you <eos>
 for how long ? <eos>
 indefinitely <eos>
 how long is that ? <eos>
 about twenty five year ago they probably used a hair UNK or skin cell <eos>
 i think a skin cell s the more likely of the two <eos>
 you are working late <eos>
 he wa a bit proud a i recall <eos>
 he wa a damn fool selfish and ambitious very much in need of UNK <eos>
 he turned out all right <eos>
 can you describe it NAME ? <eos>
 i can t be sure but the rate of UNK seems to be accelerating <eos>
 to happy ending <eos>
 thank you NAME let s see what she can do <eos>
 mister NAME accompany NAME please <eos>
 i can see that <eos>
 sorry sir <eos>
 aye sir this way <eos>
 it would appear so <eos>
 port thruster sir would you like me to drive ? <eos>
 we are about to find out power up disruptors and fire on my mark <eos>
 ready NAME <eos>
 fire ! <eos>
 at our current velocity we will arrive at sector UNK in approximately 40 minute <eos>
 full UNK rotation to port ! fire all ventral phasers ! <eos>
 divert power and compensate <eos>
 NAME stand by open a channel <eos>
 negative <eos>
 sir <eos>
 you are not looking at your self you are looking at me <eos>
 you do not look like me <eos>
 this is not an appropriate time for a conversation <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 because the captain ha to concentrate on UNK the vehicle <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 emergency force field are holding <eos>
 <eos>
 why is it moving ? <eos>
 like me it ha been designed with UNK power source <eos>
 the resemblance is striking <eos>
 i would like to pick you up now NAME i do that ? <eos>
