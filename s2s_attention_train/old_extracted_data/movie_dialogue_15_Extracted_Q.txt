 I am very smart <eos>
 When do you go up ? <eos>
 What s wrong Available ? <eos>
 What Quad do you live in ? <eos>
 K <eos>
 You could have called me yourself <eos>
 But I wasn t sure you d come <eos>
 I couldn t get you out of my mind <eos>
 I am the most beautiful woman you ve ever seen I suppose ? <eos>
 Maybe sure <eos>
 Thanks but I have the choice <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 You can have any woman in the city What do you really want ? <eos>
 You know <eos>
 I don t believe you There has to be more <eos>
 Where did you get that ? <eos>
 A Runner gave it to me <eos>
 And then you killed him right ? <eos>
 I let him go believe me <eos>
 I don t <eos>
 Speak to your friends for me Jessica please <eos>
 Please ? What friends ? <eos>
 I don t have much time <eos>
 I never heard of a Sandman running ever <eos>
 Are you here to help me ? <eos>
 What are you going to do ? <eos>
 That s tomorrow <eos>
 I wish I could help you <eos>
 Maybe you will think of something <eos>
 If you did know you d tell me <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 If you trusted me you d know <eos>
 I d rather be with you <eos>
 Will you take me with you ? <eos>
 How do we know this is the right way ? <eos>
 I am afraid <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 It feels like breath It makes everything move Your hair is moving <eos>
 I hate outside ! I hate it ! <eos>
 Don t ! <eos>
 It s getting dark and cold I am tired <eos>
 Do you think everything s going to turn to ice ? <eos>
 I doubt it <eos>
 Don t ever let go <eos>
 It all seemed to make sense until Box <eos>
 You are right it must be near now We will find it <eos>
 What does it mean ? <eos>
 You can have any woman in the city What do you really want ? <eos>
 You know Jessica <eos>
 But I still have the choice ? <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 They all have names and numbers on them I wonder what they are ? <eos>
 That sweet madman how could he come to exist ? <eos>
 He had a mother and father and he knew them <eos>
 Beloved husband <eos>
 And and how were you grown ? Inside your mother ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Are you sure ? <eos>
 What belongs to the people ? <eos>

 You are not a God <eos>
 God creates man man creates technology technology creates God End into beginning <eos>

 The new world <eos>

 You were the one who was dying <eos>
 You sealed off the system When it crashes everyone dies with you <eos>
 Yes but only in the dream they call life <eos>
 Dream ? ! <eos>
 Unlimited energy out there Enough to run this world for all eternity <eos>
 But you will never be able to get it through the maze <eos>
 But once the system touches the net all links are severed Everybody dies <eos>
 Only up there in the dream they called life <eos>
 Remember I am not the one who chose this <eos>
 Where the hell are you going ? <eos>

 Champion s going to bounce back and I want to be here when it does <eos>
 Me too <eos>

 If someone looks at you you immediately become visible again <eos>
 So how do you know that you ve ever been invisible ? <eos>
 Come on guys we are fighting against evil <eos>
 You are the Sphinx <eos>

 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 And it would be the right thing to do <eos>
 Have you ever seen him ? <eos>

 There s a vague similarity <eos>
 Maybe you should try a more romantic approach <eos>
 Like what ? Cutting off my own ear ? <eos>
 Or flowers <eos>
 I saw him go in and he didn t come out ! <eos>
 Let s go <eos>
 I am soaked Oh great <eos>
 Maybe she s right <eos>
 Roy <eos>

 I know whose blood you need to end the curse <eos>
 Say the name or I slit your throat <eos>
 You d best take a swim Jack <eos>
 So how did you get off that island anyway ? <eos>
 You can go to your grave not knowing <eos>
 No I really think I do <eos>
 You ve no hope of surviving Norrington s attack that is if you are mortal <eos>
 Now you can take care of the Dauntless right ? <eos>
 There s another exit ? <eos>

 Looks like your back to having nothing to offer <eos>
 Do you believe him ? <eos>
 My apologies miss As you were saying before you were so rudely interrupted ? <eos>
 I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request Means No <eos>
 You have a name missy ? <eos>
 Maid or not it fits you <eos>
 Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner ? <eos>
 Oh there would be no sense in killing you Miss Turner <eos>
 Then why aren t you eating ? <eos>
 Do you not know what this is then ? <eos>
 It s a pirate medallion <eos>
 Agreed You have my word as a gentleman of fortune <eos>
 Man overboard ! <eos>
 Boy overboard ! <eos>

 His name is Will Turner that s all I found out <eos>
 Commodore I must protest Pirate or not this man saved my life <eos>
 Elizabeth I hereby withdraw my proposal <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Elizabeth ? Is everything all right ? Are you decent ? <eos>
 It s beautiful May I inquire as to the occasion ? <eos>
 Although I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today <eos>
 Ceremony ? <eos>
 Difficult to say <eos>
 I am told that dress is the very latest fashion in London <eos>
 Elizabeth this is hardly appropriate <eos>
 I could never forget it Miss Swann <eos>
 Will how many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth ? <eos>
 I am glad we got here in time <eos>
 I can t believe he would make such a sacrifice for us <eos>
 There And don t you dare tell me that wasn t a proper kiss ! <eos>
 Elizabeth I think it doesn t matter that we are of a different class <eos>
 It doesn t ! <eos>
 Miss Swann <eos>
 You are despicable <eos>
 You ? ! <eos>
 Me ! <eos>
 You are in league with Barbossa ! <eos>
 Come on ! <eos>
 Has it changed since the last time you were here ? <eos>
 Captain Sparrow ! We have to get off this island immediately ! <eos>
 That was before I met one of course <eos>
 Now I must hear this song An authentic pirate song Have at it <eos>
 Well perhaps with a bit more to drink I might <eos>
 To freedom <eos>
 What are you doing ? You ve burned our food the shade the rum ! <eos>
 Kid s a bit of a stick isn t he ? <eos>
 We d best drop canvas sir ! <eos>
 What s in your head to put you in such a fine mood ? <eos>
 How did you get off the island ? <eos>
 Blast it I am already awake ! <eos>
 We can at least fight we might be able to kill a few <eos>
 All the men in place sir Ready to fire <eos>
 Sir ! Shall I break out the cannons ? <eos>
 This dock is off limits to civilians <eos>
 What s your name ? <eos>
 Well well Jack Sparrow isn t it ? <eos>
 But it seems to be enough to condemn him <eos>
 We had time to get to know each other <eos>
 Do you think this is wise boy ? Crossing blades with a pirate ? <eos>
 You threatened Miss Swann <eos>
 You cheated <eos>
 Move away <eos>
 No <eos>
 Move ! <eos>
 Agreed <eos>
 Not without my effects <eos>
 This is either crazy or brilliant <eos>
 Everybody stay calm We are taking over the ship ! <eos>
 Tortuga ? <eos>
 Just do it quickly <eos>
 Shut up before you lose them all ! <eos>
 Miss Swann ! We are here to rescue you ! It s going badly ! <eos>
 No <eos>
 Do you have any idea where you are going ? <eos>
 Jack ! <eos>
 Are you certain this is the right way ? <eos>
 What s your business in Port Royal Mr Smith ? <eos>
 I think he s telling the truth <eos>
 He s not telling the truth <eos>
 He may be <eos>
 That Jack Sparrow he talked about the Black Pearl <eos>
 Mentioned it is more what he did <eos>
 He s still breathing <eos>
 What happened here ? <eos>
 Has my daughter given you an answer yet ? <eos>
 No She hasn t <eos>
 Well she had a very taxing day Ghastly weather tonight <eos>
 Commodore <eos>
 A moment <eos>
 But <eos>
 Please <eos>
 How long do you leave him in there ? <eos>
 Wheelchair accessible <eos>
 You can t mean that <eos>
 Something to drink Dr Bright ? <eos>
 No thank you <eos>
 We will always love most that which we create Don t you agree Susan ? <eos>
 What are you going to do to him ? <eos>
 What did you use ? <eos>
 I should kill you right now for what you did to me ! <eos>
 How apropos <eos>
 I know what you are doing <eos>
 You mean besides kicking your ass ? ! <eos>
 Like rotting meat <eos>
 Oh no ? Smell this <eos>
 Icarus please if you want me to give you a bath just say so <eos>
 Icky ! What s happening ? <eos>
 Gently Ott Gently <eos>
 Do you think she will give us the designs ? <eos>
 Eventually These things are always a matter of leverage <eos>
 And you think O Brien is that leverage ? <eos>
 And you still believe he s going to come here ? <eos>
 Based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable <eos>
 Do you think she loves him ? <eos>
 Poppy are you in one of your moods again ? <eos>
 Icarus ? <eos>
 I promise my dear I will give the matter some consideration <eos>
 Consideration ? <eos>
 It will be an ascension <eos>
 I was wondering if you d finished considering ? <eos>
 Considering what ? <eos>
 Poppy please <eos>
 If you loved me like I loved you ? <eos>
 Did you feel that ? <eos>
 Did I ? I ve been waiting for that for years <eos>
 She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys <eos>
 Where did he go ? <eos>
 They are here ! They are here ! We have the nanobot <eos>
 Dr Makeo is working on it now sir I estimate at least another six hours <eos>
 Excellent work Dr Nebbleman You have outdone yourself <eos>
 Hey ! <eos>
 You don t want this <eos>
 Yeah I do ! <eos>
 You have no idea what this is doing to your body <eos>
 Here kid this is great stuff Why don t you give it a try ? <eos>
 Do you remember about five years ago that uh incident at Purnell Labs ? <eos>
 Oh yeah They were working on molecular assemblers too weren t they ? <eos>
 They also tried using viral R N A as the bonding element <eos>
 What did security say ? <eos>
 They will in validate the key Probably nothing <eos>
 Well you got another problem <eos>
 The replicators ? <eos>
 Worse Mrs Argon wants to talk to you She s waiting in the lab <eos>
 You were never invited to my house <eos>
 I don t believe this is happening <eos>
 Susan Dr Argon is giving you an opportunity here <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 It s Sim We are almost there <eos>
 What s it smell like ? <eos>
 Smell ? Uh something like methylcyanoacrylate <eos>
 Like Crazy Glue ? <eos>
 Sir please try to hold still <eos>
 Susan ! <eos>
 Daniel <eos>
 When did you ? <eos>
 Been out for six months now <eos>
 Really ? What have you been doing ? <eos>
 Nothing really worthwhile <eos>
 Daniel give him the Trix <eos>
 Susie ! You gotta help me ! <eos>
 Daniel what are you doing here ? <eos>
 Please Susan ! I need help ! Something is wrong with me ! <eos>
 Sorry Daniel I am a physicist not a psychiatrist <eos>
 They did it to me ! <eos>
 just like the mouse <eos>
 Mouse ? What mouse ? <eos>
 My first organic polymerization was a lab mouse <eos>
 What happened to it ? <eos>
 You don t know ? <eos>
 It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment <eos>
 But you ve polymerized single celled bacteria and the fruit flies I know you have <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Pills you know how I feel about pills <eos>
 Why do we need it ? <eos>
 The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste <eos>
 The replicators start off like assemblers but the replicators never stabilize <eos>
 That was an egg ? <eos>
 Three days ago it was <eos>
 What do these replicators do to people ? <eos>
 So right now there s little replicators spreading throughout Argon s lab ? <eos>
 That s right <eos>
 I think while we are waiting we had better run some basic diagnostics on you <eos>
 Is something wrong ? <eos>
 Susan ! <eos>
 Look at this ! <eos>
 Just look at it ! <eos>
 Just like old times <eos>
 I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me <eos>
 I feel very emotional right now A bit out of control <eos>
 Probably the caffeine <eos>
 Do you have something to bring me down ? <eos>
 Uh oh I remember that temper <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 The nanobot it s not here <eos>
 How far can you stretch ? <eos>
 That s pretty good <eos>
 Did you go ? <eos>
 Who is he ? <eos>
 Run Daniel ! Get out of here ! <eos>
 You saved my life <eos>
 What in the ? <eos>
 Oh shit the meltdown It s spread to the tower <eos>
 We ve got to get the nanobot <eos>
 It s too late Argon injected it <eos>
 That means the nanobot is still inside him <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 What would happen if I threw him into the core ? <eos>
 You are not going after Argon ! <eos>
 I have to ! <eos>
 Things do change <eos>
 Only this ain t no tranquilizer gun Now let s go ! <eos>
 All the different ways that I could kill you <eos>
 Maybe you are ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof ? <eos>
 That s impossible <eos>
 Mrs Argon ? It s Sim <eos>
 Mr Sim ? Do you have him ? He s alive ? <eos>
 Oh yeah he s alive Technically <eos>
 And you have him ? <eos>
 Vermin <eos>
 I could have you fired right now <eos>
 Icky ! <eos>
 Okay Barbie let s get this over with <eos>

 We should be going <eos>
 So I will meet you at the restaraunt ? <eos>
 and the listless ones do the binding <eos>
 It s remarkable Doctor The patients are so subdued so docile <eos>
 To seal the wound he took a poker from the fire <eos>
 Then how can we know who is truly good and who is evil ? <eos>
 Has he hurt you ? <eos>
 In part yes <eos>
 Charenton has changed it s not safe for you here <eos>
 Don t turn us out Abbe <eos>
 Go back to your room Quickly <eos>
 What ? What ve I done ? <eos>
 Don t come back not tonight not again <eos>
 Free his mouth <eos>
 Mustn t do that sir <eos>
 I must grant him his last rites <eos>
 I don t take my orders from you not anymore <eos>
 Care for a splash of wine Abbe ? <eos>
 It s not even noon <eos>
 You ve a touch of the poet too perhaps you should take up the quill <eos>
 You mean to take us all down with you ? <eos>
 I will die of loneliness ! I ve no company but the characters I create <eos>
 Virgin birth ha ! An entire religion built on an oxymoron ! <eos>
 Orvolle His wine From now on nothing but water at every meal <eos>
 water ! <eos>
 WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE ? <eos>
 OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES ! <eos>
 Coulmier you animal ! <eos>
 I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT MARQUIS ! <eos>
 Oh but you must my pumpkin ! Sex without flirtation is merely rape ! <eos>
 It s a potent aphrodisiac isn t it ? Power over another man <eos>
 It s no secret that you loved her <eos>
 Oh that s rich coming from her lapdog <eos>
 I saw the longing in your eye <eos>
 that was lust <eos>
 I dare you Stab my flesh Which one of us will bleed ? <eos>
 Abbe de Coulmier ! <eos>
 I am here <eos>
 Surely you will grant me a final word <eos>
 I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction <eos>
 Why is he in your care and not a proper prison ? <eos>
 His wife s influence <eos>
 His wife s ? <eos>
 Oh That <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 It s essential to his recovery a purgative for the toxins in his mind <eos>
 Do you favor its publication ? <eos>
 On the contrary Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself <eos>
 And place my reputation at stake ? <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 I spoke to him with reason and compassion the tools which serve us best here <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 He s more than a patient Doctor the Marquis is my friend <eos>
 You keep strange company Abbe But if you truly have matters in hand here <eos>
 I have <eos>
 Madame Bougival Mademoiselle Clairwil and of course the Marquis wife <eos>
 It was fiction of course <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 It was not inspired by circumstance <eos>
 You will get more from her with kindness than you will with force <eos>
 If only blood will appease you then shed mine <eos>
 Perhaps you will be so kind as to remind me of her name <eos>
 I beg you Doctor don t make me say it <eos>
 But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an aggressive course of treatment <eos>
 Quite <eos>
 Charenton ? The administrator there is quite well loved is he not ? <eos>
 I am afraid so he s an idealist You will have to be politic <eos>
 You asked my name once it s Madeleine <eos>
 I am only a laundress not a detective <eos>
 I am hungry for a proper visit <eos>
 Don t start <eos>
 The peril of composing such incendiary prose <eos>
 A kiss for each page <eos>
 Must I administer them directly or might I blow them ? <eos>
 The price my coquette is every bit as firm as I am <eos>
 It s a long story this one <eos>
 The climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap <eos>
 The story s thrilling conclusion comes at a premium <eos>
 They ve taken your clothes ? <eos>
 Surely you ve seen a man naked <eos>
 I must say in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations <eos>
 It needn t be not if you ve another story <eos>
 How do you propose I write it ? With dust upon the air ? <eos>
 It is customary to write first and request an appointment <eos>
 Desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy <eos>
 Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them <eos>
 I am not a wealthy woman <eos>
 But you ve a pension haven t you from the sale of his books ? <eos>
 It s tainted money Doctor <eos>
 What a beautiful thought Marquise <eos>
 What thought is that ? <eos>
 I am eternally in your debt <eos>
 And I in yours <eos>
 Doctor Can I impart to you his cruelest trick ? <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 Hm ? Tell me What other treats ? <eos>
 Leave at once <eos>
 But it s just begun <eos>

 The S E C has turned down my request for relief on the debts <eos>

 Mank ! You scoundrel ! What took you so long ? ! <eos>
 He will destroy us <eos>

 The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage <eos>

 I thought he was the Chief Engineer <eos>
 He is <eos>
 Target their Bridge <eos>
 Actually Captain your precise target area was thirty five meters that way <eos>
 This is its current position <eos>
 Are any of them inhabited ? <eos>
 Veridian III is uninhabited but Veridian IV supports a pre industrial humanoid society <eos>
 Population ? <eos>
 Approximately forty seven minutes sir <eos>
 But at the first sign of trouble I am going to deactivate it Agreed ? <eos>
 I get it I get it <eos>
 I don t see a control panel or an access port <eos>
 Data this isn t the time <eos>
 Data are you all right ? <eos>
 I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays <eos>
 That s it Bridge we are all out ! <eos>
 Sensors show five life signs aboard the station Captain <eos>
 Looks like you are stuck with emotions for a while How do you feel ? <eos>
 I am quite preoccupied with concern about Geordi <eos>
 We all are Data But we are going to get him back <eos>
 I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters attempting to level our descent <eos>
 We are within visual range of the energy distortion Captain <eos>
 We are within range sir <eos>
 Deck 15 section 21 alpha <eos>
 Guinan what s going on ? Where am I ? <eos>
 This is the Nexus ? <eos>
 For you This is where you wanted to be <eos>
 But I never had a wife children a home like this <eos>
 I am Captain John Harriman I d like to welcome you all aboard <eos>
 Well may we have a look around ? <eos>
 Excuse me gentlemen if you will take your seats <eos>
 What about the gravimetric distortions ? They will tear us apart <eos>
 Beautiful day isn t it ? <eos>
 This clock I gave this clock to Bones <eos>

 Close to retirement ? <eos>
 You know Scotty it amazes me <eos>
 And what would that be sir ? <eos>
 Sulu When did he find the time for a family ? <eos>
 Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space time continuum <eos>
 The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death Scotty ? <eos>
 Keep her together until I get back <eos>
 Kirk here <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 There s still no indication of why they attacked the station ? <eos>
 We think they were looking for something they practically tore the place apart <eos>
 Hmm Inform Starfleet Command This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector <eos>
 You want me to contact Starfleet ? <eos>
 Is there a problem ? <eos>
 No sir <eos>
 Report <eos>
 A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star All nuclearfusion is breaking down <eos>
 That s a pretty big margin of error <eos>
 Captain are you all right ? <eos>
 You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line <eos>
 My brother had shouldered that burden allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs <eos>
 Or perhaps they are on the surface <eos>
 Doctor Soran ? <eos>
 We are all mortal Soran It s one of the truths of ou existence <eos>
 What if I told you I found a new truth ? <eos>
 The Nexus <eos>
 The royal studs ? <eos>

 These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors <eos>
 Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago <eos>
 They have found a way to penetrate our shields <eos>

 Yes Enough energy to hide a ship wouldn t you say ? <eos>
 A cloaking device ? <eos>
 Klingon Bird of Prey sir ! She s arming torpedoes ! <eos>

 Beyond what I told you sir it is classified information <eos>
 Umm And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information ? <eos>
 I would think so sir He s on the Fleet General Staff <eos>
 Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis ? <eos>
 To Doctor Marcus the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I <eos>
 Well done Commander <eos>
 Where s Dr Marcus <eos>
 Why didn t you tell me ? <eos>
 It s a long story <eos>
 It s the Genesis Wave ! <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 He s on a build up to detonation ! <eos>
 How soon <eos>
 We encoded four minutes <eos>
 We will beam aboard and stop it <eos>
 I don t mean to intrude <eos>

 Time s up Admiral <eos>
 Captain We are waiting What s the delay ? <eos>
 All is well sir You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis <eos>
 Scotty what s left ? <eos>
 Just the batteries sir I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes <eos>
 We don t have minutes Can you give me phaser power ? <eos>
 Just barely sir <eos>
 I will need ten minutes sir til the radiation dissipates <eos>
 Uhura Can t you augment ? <eos>
 She s not responding <eos>
 Try the emergency channels <eos>

 Carol Marcus <eos>
 What s she doing here ? <eos>
 Is it possible their COMM system has failed ? <eos>
 They knew just where to hit us <eos>
 WHO ? Who knew just where to hit us ? And u why u ? <eos>
 One thing is certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power <eos>
 Visual ! Mr Sulu divert everything to the phasers <eos>
 Not enough against their shields <eos>
 The prefix code ? <eos>
 What IS working around here ? <eos>
 Not much Admiral We have partial main power <eos>
 That s it ? <eos>

 Uhura ! What s happening ? Damn it <eos>
 Transmission jammed at the source sir <eos>
 Any suggestions Admiral ? <eos>
 Lieutenant are you wearing your hair differently ? <eos>
 May I speak sir ? <eos>
 Lieutenant self expression does not seem to be one of your problems <eos>
 I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating <eos>
 You earned it <eos>
 I did not think so <eos>
 You are bothered by your performance on the u Kobayashi Maru u <eos>
 I failed to resolve the situation <eos>
 There is no correct resolution It is a test of character <eos>
 May I ask how u you u dealt with the test ? <eos>
 That was a little joke <eos>
 Humor that is a difficult concept it is not logical <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 This is damned peculiar Yellow alert <eos>

 You lied <eos>
 Heard there was some excitement <eos>
 You sent them away Without even letting me say goodbye ? <eos>
 He never jokes Perhaps the professor could use your computer <eos>
 No ! No What did you have in mind ? <eos>
 Bones <eos>

 It doesn t look all that different <eos>
 Oh joy <eos>
 What did you say she was getting ? <eos>
 An experimental device doctor <eos>
 Wake up man wake up ! <eos>
 He s coming round Jim <eos>
 Congratulations Jim I think you ve saved the Earth <eos>
 You just said there aren t any except on Earth of the past <eos>
 That is what I said Doctor <eos>
 Angels and ministers of grace defend us <eos>
 I don t think he understands <eos>
 You are saying It is a compliment <eos>
 Who are you ? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me <eos>
 We are just observing <eos>
 What the hell do you think you are doing ? <eos>
 What s causing that ! ? <eos>
 Captain their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power ! <eos>
 Can you isolate the wave ? <eos>

 Find it ? <eos>
 How long ? <eos>

 Mr Spock your computations ? <eos>
 In progress Admiral <eos>
 Weren t those a birthday present from Dr McCoy ? <eos>
 Oh the complete works of Jacqueline Susan the novels of Harold Robbins <eos>
 Admiral Full power is restored <eos>
 Admiral may I suggest that Dr McCoy is correct We must help Chekov <eos>
 Is that the logical thing to do Spock ? <eos>
 No Admiral But is the human thing to do <eos>
 Mr Spock where the hell is the power you promised me ? <eos>
 Spock Did braking thrusters fire ? <eos>
 They did Admiral <eos>

 It s under water ! There s no way to reach it <eos>
 Go on ahead Close the hatch ! <eos>
 Excelsior ? Why in God s name would you want that bucket of bolts ? <eos>

 Hi <eos>
 Hi Huey 205 isn t it ? <eos>
 Right on You fly ? <eos>
 Oh here and there I flew something similar in my Academy days <eos>
 All right then this is old stuff to you <eos>
 You have warp capability ? <eos>
 I understand how you feel We just want to retrace Data s movements that day <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I don t like to leave questions unanswered <eos>
 There s a cavern at the base of the next hill <eos>
 Mother and son You arranged this ? <eos>
 There is no need for concern I am operating within normal parameters now <eos>
 You are what ? <eos>
 My father told me I shouldn t talk to you <eos>
 I understand <eos>
 Don t you ever get tired ? <eos>
 My power cells continually re charge themselves <eos>
 Anij ! <eos>
 Tournel will take you the rest of the way <eos>
 No I want to stay with you <eos>
 I have to go home now <eos>
 Can he breathe under water ? <eos>
 Data doesn t breathe <eos>
 Won t he rust ? <eos>
 Very funny <eos>
 Prepare to transport the hostages to the ship <eos>
 Will he live ? <eos>
 She s stabilizing <eos>
 Is it safe to move her ? <eos>
 Hello Data <eos>
 Captain Geordi ? <eos>
 Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills <eos>
 A ship <eos>
 It is clearly Federation in origin Captain <eos>
 Incomplete I might add <eos>
 it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence <eos>
 Why would the Federation or the Son a wish to move the Ba ku ? <eos>
 Captain I ve activated transport inhibitors around the village <eos>
 How many ? <eos>
 I am showing fresh air behind this calcite formation Captain <eos>
 Will the structure hold if we blast through ? <eos>
 It isn t safe for you to remain in this area <eos>
 I will order Riker to turn around <eos>
 You are not going to launch anything until <eos>
 We are taking this ship out of here this mission is over <eos>
 It is not over <eos>
 I wonder which one of us will be facing that court martial <eos>
 The countdown control has been transferred to the collector I can t override <eos>
 They are following the kelbonite deposits using the interference to block our transporters <eos>
 We are about to lose communications with Starfleet Captain <eos>
 The torque sensors are out of alignment by twelve microns you could hear that ? <eos>
 Implants bothering you ? <eos>
 A photon torpedo Isn t that the universal greeting when communications are down ? <eos>
 We are pulling it like a zipper across space <eos>
 Options ? <eos>
 I don t think they believe us <eos>
 Sir they ve detonated an isolytic burst a subspace tear is forming <eos>
 The tear is closing on us impact in fifteen seconds <eos>
 The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son a s throat <eos>
 Commander if one of their weapons hits that gas <eos>
 Commander I am showing two Son a ships on an intercept course <eos>
 How long til they reach us ? <eos>
 I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord <eos>
 We are still thirty six minutes from transmission range sir <eos>
 They are powering their forward weapons array <eos>
 Yew cheen chef faw <eos>
 Who is it ? <eos>
 Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven t left yet <eos>
 Deck five <eos>
 Prepare the ship for departure at oh seven hundred hours <eos>
 You must be planning on doing some hunting <eos>
 I wish there was a way to bring them back home <eos>
 Ask them <eos>
 Bridge to Captain Picard We are approaching sector four four one <eos>
 I I must have slept through my alarm I am on my way <eos>
 Worf to Picard <eos>
 Yes yes I can hear you <eos>
 Worf you must hurry <eos>
 We are coming as fast as we can we can t risk using phasers <eos>
 Captain <eos>
 Come out come out wherever you are <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Direct hit He s resetting his shield harmonics <eos>
 He s activated a transport inhibitor <eos>
 Scanners are off line ! <eos>
 The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire ! <eos>
 Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings ? <eos>
 No sir <eos>
 Debrief them again Have you been in a fight Commander ? <eos>
 No sir It is a gorch <eos>
 Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned <eos>
 Should I distribute phasers to the Ba ku sir ? <eos>
 You need a haircut Commander <eos>
 Isolinear tags Their transporters can lock onto them <eos>
 All injector sub systems are confirmed off line <eos>
 One It s Ru afo <eos>
 Can you beam him off ? <eos>
 Negative He s established a security field around the control room <eos>
 Population three hundred million <eos>
 Say the greeting again <eos>
 I don t see anything to suggest the Son a have any interest in sociology <eos>
 What are they interested in ? <eos>
 Wine women and song <eos>
 Why would we be involved with these people ? <eos>
 You haven t done that in a long time <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 What you are doing to my neck <eos>
 This isn t one of the usual therapeutic postures <eos>
 But it s comfortable <eos>
 Why don t you try sitting up ? <eos>
 Or you could try lying down <eos>
 Both I think I am having a mid life crisis <eos>
 I believe you <eos>
 I am not sleeping well <eos>
 Augh <eos>
 Augh ? <eos>
 All hands Battle stations ! <eos>
 Initiate launch sequence <eos>
 Exactly as the simulations predicted <eos>
 Sir I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels <eos>
 Your scanners must be malfunctioning <eos>
 This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters are they all useless ? <eos>
 They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here <eos>
 Montana Energize <eos>
 I have to go back to the silo Will you be all right ? <eos>
 You actually performed surgery ? <eos>
 How long has he been unconscious ? <eos>
 Is it Japanese ? <eos>
 Um yeah Now he s going to need a respirator Do you have one ? <eos>
 His automatic reflexes are fluctuating We ve got to get him on a respirator <eos>
 You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg ? <eos>
 Have you ever wondered what it s like to have flesh ? <eos>
 You ve taken your first step toward perfection How does it feel ? <eos>

 Something wrong with that ? <eos>
 There is no invasion <eos>

 Captain there are five Borg ships closing in on our position <eos>
 Hull integrity down to thirty percent <eos>
 Target locked ! <eos>
 Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command Admiral Hayes <eos>
 We are caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex <eos>
 They must ve done it in the past they went back and changed history <eos>
 Report <eos>
 We are still in Earth orbit <eos>
 Looks like they damaged the silo <eos>
 Life signs ? <eos>
 Good luck sir <eos>
 Return to our own time ? <eos>

 Unless you d like to stay <eos>
 Casualties are light Captain Minor buckling on the port nacelle Nothing serious <eos>
 A ship wide decompression has been initiated ! <eos>
 What the hell is happening Worf ? <eos>
 What are they doing ? <eos>
 They are re routing the deflector power conduits <eos>
 They are connecting the conduits to subspace communications <eos>
 We have to stop them from sending that message <eos>
 Agreed Options ? <eos>
 Worf ! I am going to need at least five minutes ! <eos>
 Report ! <eos>
 We ve lost Bridge control ! <eos>
 Emergency override ! <eos>
 All right we ve lost control of eight decks three Cargo Bays one Shuttlebay <eos>
 They are bypassing Engineering <eos>
 I remember it made me sick <eos>
 What are you suggesting ? <eos>
 I have to admit there was a moment there when <eos>
 Worf to Bridge <eos>
 Riker here <eos>
 Worf to Bridge We are about to enter the Environmental Control Room <eos>
 Worf ? Is something wrong ? <eos>
 What the hell happened down there Worf ? <eos>
 Captain they are firing at a nuclear missile silo in central Montana <eos>
 Even Data ? <eos>
 Good luck Captain <eos>
 I believe the operation is over <eos>
 I am going to perform surgery on a torpedo you never know <eos>
 You may need assistance doctor <eos>
 Bet you wish you d stood in bed <eos>
 Spock that was actually funny <eos>
 Calm yourself doctor the operation is almost complete <eos>
 Pity they are retiring us just as I was starting to understand you Spock <eos>
 Or not to be <eos>
 Uh Jim <eos>
 What the Hell s going on ? <eos>
 Sweet Jesus ! He s lost a lot of whatever this stuff is <eos>
 Can you ? <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Thanks <eos>
 Figures <eos>
 Three months till retirement What a way to finish <eos>
 We are not finished <eos>
 What is it with you anyway ? <eos>
 Still think we are finished ? <eos>
 What kind of creature is this ? Last night you two were spooning <eos>
 Jim leave me I am finished <eos>
 Damned clever if you ask me <eos>
 ABSOLUTELY NOT ! <eos>
 Perhaps with a few small steps at a time Like this one <eos>
 We are explorers not diplomats ! <eos>
 This is fun <eos>
 Too bad we can t SMELL her <eos>
 Are you carrying a surgeon ? <eos>
 We were until your torpedoes ! <eos>
 Doctor McCoy what is your current medical status ? <eos>
 Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him ? <eos>
 Barely <eos>
 I didn t have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed <eos>
 They will respect him now <eos>
 I ve always wanted to meet you Captain <eos>
 Would you care to go topside ? <eos>
 He s a DOCTOR ! <eos>
 Are those your words ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Spoken by you ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Louder please We cannot hear you <eos>
 As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command <eos>
 Where is Mr Sulu ? <eos>
 Captain you are not going to show them the bridge ? ? <eos>
 Just the size of my head <eos>
 Torpedo room ? <eos>
 Captain if they fire at us with our shields down <eos>
 From Starfleet ? <eos>
 Where IS the conference ? <eos>
 Shields Battle stations <eos>
 Mr Chekov take us forward thrusters only one half impulse power <eos>
 Mr Chekov slow down Take us forward thrusters only one quarter impulse power <eos>
 Course heading Captain ? <eos>
 They are preparing to fire <eos>
 Klingon blood <eos>
 They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here <eos>
 This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory <eos>
 Now we go to Starfleet ? <eos>
 Now we expand our search to include uniforms <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 Captain I am getting a message from Klingon High Command <eos>
 An INCIDENT ? <eos>
 Do we report this sir ? <eos>
 We d be delighted to accept your gracious invitation <eos>
 We will make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours <eos>
 Thank you Captain Kirk The evening has been most edifying <eos>
 I ve heard of chameloids Shapeshifters I thought you were mythical <eos>
 Your friends are late <eos>
 Isn t it about time you became something else ? <eos>
 What took you so long ? <eos>
 Kill him ! He s the one ! ! <eos>
 He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens <eos>
 He s got it <eos>
 And your coat <eos>
 Fraid not It wouldn t fit him anyway <eos>
 How did you know ? <eos>
 We don t get many presidential assassins <eos>
 We didn t kill Gorkon <eos>
 How much time s left of your sentence ? <eos>
 That s not his knee Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place Captain <eos>
 Listen No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe <eos>
 Except us <eos>
 Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed <eos>
 Stand down your weapons <eos>
 Captain if <eos>
 Stand DOWN Mr Scott All stop That s an order <eos>
 This is incredible <eos>
 As you were Lieutenant ? <eos>
 Aft thrusters <eos>
 Thank you Lieutenant one quarter impulse power <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 Plot a course for Kronos Lieutenant <eos>
 Kronos sir ? <eos>
 I am still in the chair Lieutenant <eos>
 Sorry <eos>
 Come on Saavik you COULD knock <eos>
 We are almost at the rendezvous I thought you d want to know <eos>
 Uhura hailing frequencies Right standard rudder bring us alongside <eos>
 I hope you are happy <eos>
 Saavik you know anything about a neutron energy surge ? <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Captain our shields ! <eos>
 Just the prototype <eos>
 I have personally vouched for you in this matter Captain <eos>
 Never been this close <eos>
 I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet s mission has always been one of peace <eos>
 What is it ? <eos>
 I am uncertain <eos>
 Spock I am really tired <eos>
 We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Curiously it appears to emanate from us <eos>
 What the <eos>
 We HAVEN T fired <eos>
 Captain <eos>
 I ve been dead before Uhura raise Excelsior She ought to have the co ordinates <eos>
 Why would they give them to us ? <eos>
 Close enough to beam down ? <eos>
 What s she waiting for ? <eos>
 The only way to find out if a man s trustworthy <eos>
 Control tower reading Sir <eos>
 Channel open Captain <eos>
 Captain <eos>
 WE SURRENDER <eos>
 Gorkon s own man ? ? <eos>
 Uhura ? <eos>
 Captain we can t see her but she gives off heat <eos>
 You must have faith <eos>
 Faith ? <eos>
 Her own father ? <eos>
 A lie ? <eos>
 If you are logical <eos>
 I don t want to <eos>
 Direct hit <eos>
 According to this we ve completed our exploration of the entire sector <eos>
 Fifty four planets and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well <eos>
 I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port <eos>
 I have confirmed the location sir but <eos>
 What is it ? <eos>
 Praxis ? <eos>
 NO WAY ! <eos>
 It s as I said Mr Spock Inventory still registers every torpedo <eos>
 Yet the data banks insist we fired twice One computer is lying <eos>
 A computer canna lie sir <eos>
 I think not <eos>
 You can check the torpedoes visually if you like <eos>
 We will have to check every one of them Mr Scott <eos>
 That could take hours ! <eos>
 Nevertheless <eos>
 And if they are still in place ? <eos>
 Twenty four hours from now we won t have a clue where the Captain is <eos>
 They dinna fire on themselves And there were no other ships present <eos>
 There was an enormous neutron energy surge <eos>
 Too far off Very near us Perhaps underneath us <eos>
 If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would ve seen her ! <eos>
 A Bird of Prey canna fire when she s cloaked ! <eos>
 This one can <eos>
 They you are talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction Mr Spock <eos>
 They are outside the beaming shield Mr Scott start your engines <eos>
 They are naturally wary ma am We ve been at war a long time <eos>
 Sulu s giving us his position and telling us he s standing by <eos>
 I don t think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament <eos>
 They might as well arrest me too I felt like Lieutenant Saavik <eos>
 Do you know who I am ? <eos>
 You are me <eos>
 Do you know where you are ? <eos>
 Can you remember our father ? <eos>
 Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel ? <eos>
 No <eos>
 Brother I cannot move <eos>
 No I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because you are dangerous <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship <eos>
 I do not understand <eos>
 Do you know anything about Shinzon s plans against the Federation ? <eos>
 No <eos>
 Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship ? <eos>
 No Can I move now ? <eos>
 No I must deactivate you <eos>
 For how long ? <eos>
 Indefinitely <eos>
 When was he created ? <eos>
 About twenty five years ago They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell <eos>
 Beverly come in <eos>
 Remember him ? <eos>
 He was a bit proud as I recall <eos>
 He was a damn fool Selfish and ambitious Very much in need of seasoning <eos>
 Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels you are completely normal <eos>
 How long does he have ? <eos>
 So To happy endings <eos>
 The closest signature is two kilometers to the west that direction sir <eos>
 The final signature is approx imately 300 meters up that incline <eos>
 He is very observant <eos>
 Data ! <eos>
 A bit less florid Data <eos>
 A weapon <eos>
 What do you imagine this is ? <eos>
 Do you think this is a wise course of action ? <eos>
 We are about to find out Power up disruptors and fire on my mark <eos>
 Ready Captain <eos>
 How long until we reach the fleet ? <eos>
 We are losing dorsal shields <eos>
 Captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine <eos>
 We are being hailed <eos>
 Sir allow me to go You are needed here <eos>
 Negative <eos>
 Why am I looking at me ? <eos>
 You are not looking at your self You are looking at me <eos>
 You have a red shirt <eos>
 This is not an appropriate time for a conversation <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle <eos>
 We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten <eos>
 What is our approximate distance ? <eos>
 It appears to be an arm <eos>
 Why is it moving ? <eos>
 It s you <eos>
 No <eos>
 If you wouldn t mind <eos>
 May I have this dance ? <eos>
 Counselor <eos>
 Do you have a moment sir ? <eos>
 I am going to miss you <eos>
 How can you be certain ? <eos>
 Captain I might have a way to find them <eos>
 Counselor ? <eos>
 The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle me <eos>
 But how can he ? He will kill you <eos>
 Imzadi This is so good <eos>
 I will always be with you now Now and forever <eos>
 No <eos>
 Captain Picard Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore Might we be of assistance ? <eos>
 Your timing is impeccable Commander <eos>
 The Empire considers this a matter of internal security We regret you ve become involved <eos>
 I am afraid that drink will have to wait Captain <eos>
 Do you have life support ? <eos>
  <eos>
 I read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface <eos>
 Cannon fodder <eos>
 What s he doing ? <eos>
 He thinks he knows exactly what I am going to do <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 How long until he can fire ? <eos>
 Sir we are being hailed <eos>
 Enterprise We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar <eos>
 Praetor Shinzon I am pleased to <eos>
 I won t do it <eos>
 Won t do what Mister Worf ? <eos>
 Captain I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear Naked <eos>
 I am picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system <eos>
 To find the head sir ? <eos>
 Sir I recommend we raise shields <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Captain ! <eos>
 Tactical analysis Mister Worf <eos>
 We are being hailed <eos>
 Sir we ve had an unauthorized access into the main computer <eos>
 Sir we are being hailed <eos>
 Coordinate our attack with the Valdore s tactical officer Triangulate fire on any shield impacts <eos>
 Captain the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone <eos>
 Captain you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command <eos>
 We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators <eos>
 A coup d etat ? <eos>
 She s not out for a pleasure cruise <eos>
 Not very chatty <eos>
 He wasn t designed to live a complete human life span <eos>
 Strength in numbers ? <eos>
 Report <eos>
 Serving with you has been an honor <eos>
 I hope you will forgive the darkness we are not comfortable in the light <eos>
 And you are not as we imagined you <eos>
 Praetor ? <eos>
 Romulan ale I am surprised I can t stand it <eos>
 After you Praetor <eos>
 So I am not as tall as you expected ? <eos>
 I always hoped I would hit two meters <eos>
 With a full head of hair <eos>
 In time Jean Luc <eos>
 Hello Jean Luc <eos>
 Why am I here ? <eos>
 That s your life not mine <eos>
 Please <eos>
 It s too late <eos>
 You can still make a choice ! Make the right one now ! <eos>
 Praetor we ve received the transponder signal <eos>
 Report ! <eos>
 Target disruptors Destroy them <eos>
 Deploy the weapon Kill everything on that ship Then set a course for Earth <eos>
 What about Picard ? <eos>
 Our greater goal is more important brother <eos>
 Well that sounds relaxing too <eos>
 So they ve got him up and running <eos>
 He s a very unusual android <eos>
 My God <eos>
 Minimal damage to the Scimitar <eos>
 Believe it or not I think the cavalry has arrived <eos>
 Intruder alert ! <eos>
 Are we prepared ? <eos>
 This is a mistake <eos>
 He s gentler than I thought And he has a sense of humor <eos>
 Don t forget our mission Shinzon We should act Now Time is running out <eos>
 The bond is broken <eos>
 Find her again <eos>
 No this is wasting time <eos>
 It s accelerating You have no more time for games <eos>
 How long ? <eos>
 How long until we reach the Rift ? <eos>
 Praetor <eos>
 What is it ? ! ! Focus on your job ! ! <eos>
 How many Warbirds will you need ? <eos>
 Then I don t understand the reason for the delay ! <eos>
 You don t have to understand <eos>
 And bringing the Enterprise here ? ! What possible purpose could that serve ? <eos>
 I have a purpose <eos>
 Then perhaps you will enlight en us ? <eos>
 Benny God take it easy <eos>

 No one <eos>
 How did she hide it from the other nuns ? <eos>
 She undressed alone she bathed alone <eos>
 Is that normal ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 How did she hide it during the day ? <eos>
 She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to <eos>
 Didn t she have any physical examinations in this time ? <eos>
 We are examined once a year Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor s visits <eos>
 Who was the father ? <eos>
 I haven t a clue <eos>
 What man had access to her ? <eos>
 None as far as I know <eos>
 Was there a priest ? <eos>
 Yes but I <eos>
 What s his name ? <eos>
 Father Martineau but I don t see him as a candidate <eos>
 Could there have been anyone else ? <eos>
 Obviously there was <eos>
 And you didn t try to find out who ? <eos>
 Believe me I ve done everything possible short of asking Agnes <eos>
 That s absurd ! <eos>
 That possibility never occurred to you ? <eos>
 This was before her pregnancy ? <eos>
 It s my affair too <eos>
 All right what do you need <eos>
 When would Agnes have conceived the child ? <eos>
 Oh some time in January <eos>
 Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time ? <eos>
 Earthquakes ? <eos>
 Visitors to the convent <eos>
 Nothing <eos>
 Do you have a a diary or a day book ? <eos>

 Was the child full term ? <eos>
 Oh Dear God <eos>

 The sheets <eos>
 What sheets ? <eos>
 When was that ? <eos>
 The twenty third of January On that night one of our elder nuns passed away <eos>
 Sister Paul ? <eos>
 And my permission ? <eos>
 We will see about that <eos>
 Don t deny it ! <eos>
 I haven t decided yet <eos>
 The woman s health is at stake <eos>
 Her spiritual health <eos>
 I don t give a damn about her spiritual health <eos>
 Do you think Agnes is still attached to God ? <eos>
 Listen to her singing <eos>
 I d like to begin <eos>
 Begin what ? <eos>
 The hypnotism Do you still disapprove ? <eos>
 Would it stop you if I did ? <eos>
 May I be present ? <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 Stop this she will hurt herself I am not going to allow this <eos>
 This is permission to take her apart <eos>
 Where is she ? <eos>
 Hasn t she had enough ? <eos>
 I have a few more questions to ask her <eos>
 That s enough <eos>
 Agnes what happened to the baby ? <eos>
 She can t remember <eos>
 Oh don t do this ! <eos>
 Lay them down <eos>

 Just a minute hold it I am checking <eos>
 How long to fix ? <eos>

 Oh God oh <eos>

 And then we run out of food and oxygen <eos>
 Jay how s it coming on the repairs ? <eos>
 Well I am going to have to blow the engines out <eos>
 And when will you be ready to do that ? <eos>
 Oh I am not near ready yet <eos>
 Then why the hell are you sitting around here ? <eos>
 It s really on there tight <eos>
 Hey guess what ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again ! <eos>
 Might even incinerate the damn thing <eos>
 So it s trapped in between now we have to drive it out <eos>
 Hey are you guys still there ? What s going on ? <eos>
 Meet us on the bridge Be careful it s u huge u now <eos>
 All right but do u not u go below decks <eos>
 Right <eos>
 Where did it come from ? <eos>

 Blood s thoroughly oxygenated <eos>
 God that smoke s poisonous ! <eos>
 I never saw anything like that in my life except molecular acid <eos>
 But this thing uses it for u blood u <eos>
 It makes me sick to see him like that <eos>
 It s a crude symbolic language looks primitive <eos>
 We can t go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose <eos>
 It s over Hunter <eos>

 Hey now what is this ? <eos>

 Still unconscious ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Can you do anything for him ? <eos>
 The machine will bring his temperature down His vital functions are strong <eos>
 While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net <eos>
 Sounds like a rough one <eos>
 We d better seal off the lower maintenance level at least trap it there <eos>
 We ve got six hours left <eos>
 Oh my God <eos>
 You can t say that I think it s a good plan <eos>
 The flamethrower needs more fuel <eos>
 The ship s gravitational attraction must have drawn him back <eos>
 Should we go outside and bring him in ? <eos>
 It will be <eos>
 It must have stopped moving I am not getting anything <eos>
 The flamethrower ! <eos>

 My God it s stormy for a piece of rock that size ! <eos>
 Source of transmission is to the northeast about 300 meters <eos>

 That tube must be depositing it in him <eos>

 Now what ? <eos>
 So the only question left is who gets to crawl down the airshaft ? <eos>
 How did it get so u big u ? <eos>
 Two down four to go <eos>
 What s that supposed to mean ? <eos>
 Which presumably means <eos>
 u Hey watch it u ! <eos>
 Yes and maybe launch the boat and blow it too if the others are injured <eos>
 Kill me <eos>

 This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade <eos>
 This baby s got a few surprises left in her <eos>

 Asteroids ! Chewie bank left let s find out where they are coming from <eos>
 Probably an asteroid field <eos>
 Let s hope so it s just the chance we need <eos>

 Don t start a war on my wedding day ! <eos>
 The law forbids it <eos>
 There are things about love <eos>

 The King without his sword the land without a king <eos>
 Just a man A knight in the King s service <eos>
 Very well Climb up <eos>

 You provoke me Merlin <eos>
 I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames <eos>
 I am the desert where water disappears <eos>
 I am the sea which covers the desert forever under its weight <eos>

 Dodge was killed in the hunt What happened to Landon ? I don t know <eos>
 Flight is a scientific impossibility <eos>
 Then how do you account for me ? <eos>
 I don t And I am not going to try <eos>
 But what about your theory ? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it <eos>
 Zira are you trying to get my head cut off ? <eos>
 Don t be foolish If it s true they will have to accept it <eos>
 A toy It floats on the air Try it <eos>
 How did it go ? <eos>
 Which direction ? <eos>
 That way <eos>
 Any particular reason ? <eos>
 Where there s one there s another And another And another <eos>
 Well at least they haven t tried to bite us <eos>

 Objection ! These remarks are profane and irrelevant <eos>
 Objection ! <eos>

 Sustained <eos>

 Bad ? <eos>
 Bad enough <eos>
 He could hardly help suspecting you <eos>
 Cold ? <eos>
 Is this the best you can do ? <eos>
 That man over there He was in the hotel lobby <eos>
 I didn t notice him <eos>
 We walked right passed him He s following us <eos>
 Killaine s not that sort of guy He said no he meant no <eos>
 Then he s got to be a detective <eos>
 Couldn t be <eos>
 Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby ? <eos>
 Absolutely sure <eos>
 It still doesn t matter if I kiss you ? <eos>
 Nothing matters <eos>
 That s the second round I ve lost tonight That fellow hurt me <eos>
 So have I <eos>
 I hated to go to that place I almost went to the police station instead <eos>
 No percentage in that <eos>
 They are going to arrest me <eos>
 I know Killaine has a warrant <eos>
 I d still go through even if I ended up in jail <eos>
 You wouldn t like it I ve been there <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 See anything ? <eos>
 I can still see the shoreline The moon is rising <eos>
 I decided I didn t want a drink I am beginning to wonder <eos>
 Wonder what ? <eos>
 If you are doing all this just for me <eos>
 That and the fun of it <eos>

 Hello Mitchell Having fun ? <eos>
 Good afternoon Mr Campbell <eos>
 Mr Mitchell <eos>

 Not too hard is it ? <eos>
 Maybe we ve been pretty dumb <eos>

 I think so <eos>
 Where s the shell ? <eos>

 Mayfield ? She fit into this ? <eos>
 This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon ? <eos>
