 well you got another problem <eos>
 the replicators ? <eos>

 my first organic polymerization wa a lab mouse <eos>
 what happened to it ? <eos>
 i don t know <eos>
 you don t know ? <eos>
 it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment <eos>
 but you ve polymerized single celled bacteria and the fruit fly i know you have <eos>
 yes <eos>
 then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure <eos>
 pills you know how i feel about pill <eos>
 if you don t want to do it this way i can remove it surgically <eos>
 why do we need it ? <eos>
 the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste <eos>
 what waste ? <eos>
 the replicators start off like assembler but the replicators never stabilize <eos>
 what happens ? <eos>
 that wa an egg ? <eos>
 three day ago it wa <eos>
 what do these replicators do to people ? <eos>
 with enough UNK the same thing they do to everything else <eos>
 so right now there s little replicators spreading throughout NAME s lab ? <eos>
 that s right <eos>

 it s essential to his recovery a UNK for the toxin in his mind <eos>
 do you favor it UNK ? <eos>

 a computer canna lie sir <eos>
 i think not <eos>
 you can check the torpedo UNK if you like <eos>
 we will have to check every one of them mr NAME <eos>
 that could take hour ! <eos>
 nevertheless <eos>
 and if they are still in place ? <eos>
 then someone forged a data bank entry <eos>
 twenty four hour from now we won t have a clue where the NAME is <eos>
 i know precisely where he will be <eos>
 they UNK fire on themselves and there were no other ship present <eos>
 there wa an enormous neutron energy surge <eos>
 not from u ! <eos>
 too far off very near u perhaps underneath u <eos>
 if another ship had been beneath u the klingons would ve seen her ! <eos>
