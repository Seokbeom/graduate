 Why does anyone want to be in movies ? <eos>
 Yesterday you were a loan shark . <eos>

 Metal s crystallized . Gotta replace the whole deal . <eos>
 How much longer s that gonna take ? <eos>
 Like I always say <eos>

 The right way and the wrong way . <eos>
 But how long ? <eos>
 Hard to say . <eos>
 Three four days . <eos>
 Goddamit Dodge . <eos>
 She take a radio ? <eos>
 What you think there s something funny about it ? <eos>
 Warm water current maybe making the metal expand . <eos>
 Could be meant as a warning . <eos>
 So whoever did this might still be around . <eos>
 Murphy . <eos>
 I think you better see this for yourself . <eos>
 If they knew what they were carrying . <eos>
 I think you know . <eos>
 Maybe you can tell me then . <eos>
 The radio . Oh yeah the radio . <eos>

 What ? <eos>
 Do not lie to me ! <eos>
 What the fuck ? <eos>
 Look I did not touch it . Alright ? <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 Do not fall asleep . <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 Maybe twenty gallons an hour . <eos>
 Too big . More like a freighter . <eos>
 Cargo like this could make a crew think twice . <eos>
 Probably did not have time . <eos>
 That s what I call a payday . <eos>
 Hell yeah . <eos>
 You are a pal . <eos>
 Because of the gold . <eos>

 Maybe the other ship took the worst of it . <eos>
 If it was a ship she hit . <eos>
 Does not matter . <eos>

 You could say that . <eos>
 And may I see this storage facility ? <eos>
 No you may not . <eos>
 And why not Mr . Venkman ? <eos>
 Because you did not say the magic word . <eos>

 Just a little crazy . <eos>
 That would be difficult to explain . <eos>
 I would like you to try . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He knows about you . <eos>
 He s older than I . <eos>
 Perhaps . There s something more . An inheritance . <eos>
 Of bodies . <eos>
 I did not kill the watchman . <eos>
 You killed those other two . <eos>
 Not the same . <eos>
 What about that family in 31 ? <eos>
 Sometimes innocents become involved . <eos>

 Something s coming . <eos>
 It would appear so . <eos>
 Careful lad . <eos>

 Willful creature that one . <eos>
 We will never find the Baron s castle . <eos>

 The chill s worse this night . <eos>
 It feels wrong Jack . like a trap . <eos>
 Easily spoken . <eos>
 Been telling you that all along lad . <eos>

 Liar ! <eos>
 Or perchance . <eos>
 Oh fie . What about the unicorn ? <eos>
 Unicorn ? <eos>
 A promise s a sacred oath . <eos>
 All right . I will show you something sacred . <eos>
 A gentleman would offer water . <eos>
 Be patient . <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 Shhh ! <eos>
 They rival the angels of paradise . <eos>
 Jack ! <eos>
 To fetch your napkin . <eos>
 My father and the Baron . <eos>
 My own father . <eos>
 How bad was the unicorn s wound ? <eos>
 Oh yes and the mare with him . <eos>
 Its powers are strong . <eos>
 Nay Jack I am but wary of your intentions . <eos>
 Be it fit for your wife Green Jack ? <eos>
 I have no wife . <eos>
 Then perchance you will me . <eos>
 If wishes were horses even beggars would ride . <eos>
 Jack . Forgive me . <eos>
 Only what s right . <eos>
 I was bewitched . it s better this way . <eos>
 They told me you were dead . <eos>
 You have freed me Jack . <eos>
 Sunlight . It destroys him . <eos>
 Sunlight ? <eos>
 That s why he goes masked during the day . <eos>
 So he s hiding in the dark . <eos>
 In the dark . where I join him . <eos>
 You are teasing still . <eos>
 And I love you my husband . <eos>
 Ouch ! Something s biting me . <eos>
 Biting you ? <eos>
 Pinching me ! <eos>

 And charmed of course . <eos>
 Do I not please you Jack ? <eos>
 In every way . <eos>
 And am I not fair ? <eos>
 Wondrously so . <eos>
 Jest with me then . <eos>

 Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind . <eos>
 Pray you be sweet as your words dear Jack . <eos>
 A faerie s love makes anything possible . <eos>
 I am promised to another ! <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 We wait . <eos>
 I think she s about to foal . <eos>
 Watch behind or I will never collect on it ! <eos>
 Small miracles better than no miracles . <eos>
 Up ahead ! <eos>
 Bah ! You faeries have the morals of ferrets . <eos>
 It s done . we will never catch him . <eos>
 I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it . <eos>
 Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy . <eos>
 May God protect you . <eos>
 I am sending you back to Hell ! <eos>
 To Castle Couer de Noir ? <eos>
 You follow . <eos>
 You have been inside ? <eos>
 In a dream . <eos>

 Does everything have to have a point ? <eos>
 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 Josh said . <eos>
 I am not gay . <eos>
 It would help me if I could kiss you . <eos>
 Are you afraid of heights ? <eos>
 Not if what he left me was real . <eos>
 Floating to Catalina . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Will he talk to me ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 It could have been a squirt gun . <eos>
 You have been good this week . <eos>
 We have known each other since grade school . <eos>
 I have been dreading you . <eos>
 Oh yes . <eos>
 And if I enclosed it ? <eos>
 An exhaust system or a window s code . <eos>

 Allowed outside the enclosed area . <eos>
 I flushed it down the toilet . <eos>
 Well if it s we have a problem . <eos>
 Months . <eos>

 And you thought they might be under her dress ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 To check up on me ? <eos>
 I will be around to check up on you . <eos>
 Why would you be there ? <eos>
 Because I live there . <eos>

 To hide a black eye . <eos>
 Why would not she leave ? <eos>
 After everything he did to you and your mom ? <eos>

 He does not answer . <eos>
 Why does he have a lock on his door ? <eos>

 It s a pirate medallion . <eos>
 Boy overboard ! <eos>
 Fetch a hook haul him out of there ! <eos>
 I am a bit nervous myself <eos>
 You are speaking up for him again ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I know where your heart truly lies . <eos>
 That would hardly be proper . <eos>
 Captain Norrington s promotion ceremony . <eos>
 About the day we met . Do you remember ? <eos>
 Truthfully you were a bit late . <eos>
 then we never would have met . <eos>
 but that was not a proper kiss . <eos>
 Miss Swann if you will be so kind ? <eos>
 Me ! <eos>
 You are in league with Barbossa ! <eos>
 No I am rescuing you . <eos>
 To the Black Pearl . <eos>
 Nor did you I noticed . <eos>
 She can hold a bit longer . <eos>

 That we are . <eos>
 I do not think that will be necessary . <eos>
 Sorry I did not know . <eos>
 Smith . <eos>
 Captain Jack Sparrow . If you please . <eos>
 Indeed . <eos>
 Only a little . <eos>
 Pirate . <eos>

 And you want to turn pirate yourself ? <eos>
 Never . They took Miss Swann . <eos>
 How ? The key s run off . <eos>

 Good . <eos>
 Remarkable how often those two traits coincide . <eos>
 My father . William Turner ? <eos>
 I swear you look just like him . <eos>
 It s not true my father was a pirate . <eos>
 Figured you would not want to hear it . <eos>
 My father was not a pirate ! <eos>

 Jack ! <eos>

 The replicators ? <eos>
 You are looking for a urine sample . <eos>

 On the counter . <eos>
 The head shrinker at the prison . <eos>
 Argon s private lab . <eos>
 Let s go . <eos>
 I am not leaving without you Susan ! <eos>
 Did you think I could just leave you . <eos>
 It s too late . Argon injected it . <eos>
 You mean he s polymerized like me ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I have to ! <eos>
 God what a fight that was . <eos>
 We were different people then . <eos>
 I guess they do . <eos>
 Oh yes you are ! <eos>
 Oh yeah ? <eos>
 It s a miracle . <eos>
 And you have him ? <eos>
 We lost him . <eos>
 Can I help you Mrs . Argon ? <eos>

 We have been ordered to <eos>
 You having hearing problems mister ? <eos>

 You are me . <eos>

 Do not think I can not persuade her . <eos>
 I am a blank sheet . <eos>
 Do you hunt ? <eos>
 Occasionally . <eos>
 Dare say you can be taught . <eos>
 To shoot perhaps but not to kill . <eos>
 If you hunt you kill . <eos>
 You are injured . <eos>
 It s nothing . <eos>

 But yourself ? What about John Brown ? <eos>
 I said . I serve the Queen . <eos>
 No other aspiration ? <eos>
 See what ? <eos>
 Too busy looking after themselves . <eos>
 The greasy pole . <eos>
 No loyalty . <eos>
 No love . <eos>
 In time she will . <eos>
 She will think I betrayed her . <eos>
