 May I try it ? <eos>
 Majesty . <eos>

 Finally ! Such an immense joy . Diletto straordinario ! <eos>
 Your Highness . <eos>

 And the result satisfies . <eos>
 Sire . <eos>

 Molested Majesty . Twice in the course of the same lesson . <eos>
 The Director of our Opera . Count Orsini Rosenberg . <eos>

 How many pupils do you have ? <eos>
 Pupils ? <eos>

 Yes . <eos>
 How many ? <eos>
 This one will . <eos>
 Oh let s not talk about it . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 It s a secret . <eos>
 You do not have secrets from me . <eos>
 Why did not you mention it in your letters ? <eos>
 This s just a game Papa . <eos>
 But my penalty . I have got to have a penalty . <eos>
 Mine ? <eos>
 Do not worry I am not staying here to be a burden . <eos>
 No one calls you that . <eos>
 She does . She says I sleep all day . <eos>

 Are you Herr Mozart ? <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Stanzi Manzi Banzi Wanzi ! <eos>

 Wolfi ! <eos>
 Put it down ! <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 Put it down I said ! It s nothing for you . <eos>
 What ? The vaudeville what would you think ? <eos>

 So let me see it . Where s it ? <eos>
 Madame . <eos>
 Of course it s him . Who do you think it is ? <eos>
 Strudel this s Herr Mozart . Say good morning . <eos>
 Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ? <eos>
 Well your pupil s married and living in Mannheim young man . <eos>
 Really ? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction ? <eos>
 What s this Mozart ? What s the matter with you ? <eos>
 If a man cannot earn he must borrow . <eos>
 Well this s hardly the way to go about it . <eos>
 Please . I will give it back I promise . Please sir . <eos>
 My answer s no Mozart . <eos>
 Mio caro Adone . <eos>
 Ah ! <eos>
 A funny little tune but it yielded some good things . <eos>
 Ah love ! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that . <eos>
 But this s absurd ! <eos>
 Did you like it then ? <eos>
 How could I not ? <eos>
 So you see this post s very important to me right now . <eos>
 Herr Sommer . <eos>
 You do not mean to tell me you are living in poverty ? <eos>
 Do you have a daughter ? <eos>
 I am afraid not . <eos>
 I would better not . It s a bit of a secret . <eos>
 Come come Mozart I am interested . Truly . <eos>
 Forgive me . We all have patriotic feelings of some kind . <eos>
 Two thousand two hundred florins s all I need A hundred ? Fifty ? <eos>

 Yes ? <eos>
 I never knew that music like that was possible . <eos>
 You flatter me . <eos>
 What work ? <eos>
 A Mass for the dead . <eos>
 What dead ? Who s dead ? <eos>
 A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 I am taking you home . You are not well . <eos>
 No no . I have to get back . I have <eos>
 You are so good to me . Truly . Thank you . <eos>

 He knows . He knows ! <eos>
 Would you ? Actually you could . <eos>
 My dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure . <eos>
 The end of the Recordare Statuens in parte dextra . <eos>

 Taking out what you should never have put in . <eos>
 Oh yes certainly . Certainly Herr Director ! <eos>
 What s what ? <eos>
 Is the Emperor angry with me ? <eos>
 On the contrary . <eos>
 Then why does not he simply appoint me to the post ? <eos>

 No but I am the best . <eos>
 A little modesty would suit you better . <eos>

 Kapellmeister Bonno Count Orsini Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri . <eos>

 Mozart <eos>
 Oh German ! German ! Please let it be German . <eos>

 Do you understand that you have sinned ? Gravely . <eos>
 Leave me alone . <eos>
 I cannot leave alone a soul in pain . <eos>
 Are they ? <eos>
 Offer me your confession . I can offer you God s forgiveness . <eos>
 I do not seek forgiveness . <eos>
 I know a little . I studied it in my youth . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>

 Should I ? <eos>
 He was murdered Father ! Mozart ! Cruelly murdered . <eos>
 Every day . Sometimes for hours I would pray ! <eos>
 No ? Was Mozart a good man ? <eos>
 No you did not ! <eos>

 What difference does that make ? <eos>
 Mozart s writing a new opera . An Italian opera . <eos>

 Do me an enormous favor ? <eos>
 Anything . <eos>
 Tell me that it s silly of me to be apprehensive . <eos>
 It s silly of you to be apprehensive . <eos>
 Werewolves simply do not exist . <eos>
 David do you want me to stay here tonight ? <eos>
 Yeah I do but go to work . <eos>
 Okay . <eos>
 I have left those pills for you . <eos>
 A doper werewolf . <eos>

 Pull over . <eos>
 Six people mutilated ? It had to be me Alex . <eos>

 Soon as I hit one the other will know and beat us up . <eos>
 Must be a garrison in town . We are in occupied territory boys . <eos>
 Which one right or left ? <eos>
 The brown one . <eos>
 Sadie was not a man ! <eos>

 Go home Doc . They s not gonna hang no more Liberty boys . <eos>
 Go on . You are pretty much all healed up . <eos>
 I fooled them into thinking I was alone . <eos>
 Pff . They hardly even noticed you . <eos>
 So you are saying I could have done more to attract their attention . <eos>
 Mm hmm . <eos>
 Such as ? <eos>
 I figure . <eos>
 I reckoned . <eos>
 Hell of a war . <eos>
 I am sure it seemed like a good idea at the time . <eos>
 We better go to Doc s see what s going on here . <eos>
 You are doing just fine . <eos>
 Zee we got to talk to you and your father . <eos>
 Maybe maybe . <eos>
 You can shut up now . <eos>
 You are a charmer . <eos>

 See you soon . Oh and I appreciate the distraction back there . <eos>
 Hell they hardly even noticed us . <eos>
 Yeah Jimmy ? <eos>
 That he was . <eos>
 They are making him a hero now . <eos>
 Saved a lot of folk from the railroad . <eos>
 But he killed a lot of men too . <eos>
 Ca not argue that . <eos>
 So what was he ? <eos>
 I think . he was just a real interestin fella to have around . <eos>
 Yeah Jimmy ? <eos>
 How much of that story s true ? <eos>
 Everything but the boring parts . <eos>
 A fair number Ma . <eos>
 Say your prayers ? <eos>
 We are just fine thank you sir . <eos>

 Impossible ? <eos>
 As you see . <eos>
 Then you can not come in . <eos>
 I have an appointment . <eos>
 No women . Not in Boodles . Not since 1922 . <eos>
 Really what happened in 1922 ? <eos>
 Eh ? In here ! <eos>
 We have met . <eos>
 Quite right but we still make the rules . <eos>
 Rules are made to be broken . <eos>
 People too . <eos>
 Then who wins ? <eos>
 Looks like rain Steed . <eos>
 Let me guess Father ? <eos>
 Ropes ? <eos>
 Directed by laser . Bounced by satellite . Quite possible . <eos>

 Oh no Emma . They have only just begun . <eos>
 I am already married . <eos>
 Valentine listen to me . <eos>
 Choices ? <eos>
 I will never marry you . <eos>
 And you must be Steed . Please do not get up . <eos>
 I had a spot of bother at the door . <eos>
 I should not wonder . Not a woman inside Boodles since <eos>
 1922 . Why the kippers ? <eos>
 Red herring would have been too obvious do not you think ? <eos>
 So what was all this some sort of test ? <eos>
 Much better . <eos>
 Mother ? <eos>
 We are not here to talk about the weather surely . <eos>
 A kipper . Or a red herring ? What were they investigating ? <eos>
 Really ? I fail to see the connection . <eos>
 I had a feeling you would . Touche ! <eos>
 Yes indeed . I need protection . <eos>
 Thank you Trubshaw . <eos>
 Do you really think so ? <eos>
 As per mother s instructions . <eos>
 Do we always follow Mother s instructions ? <eos>
 For a man in my position <eos>
 I meant me . <eos>
 The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined . <eos>
 Any other vices ? <eos>
 Small talk . Try the weather . <eos>
 You should be dead . How do you feel ? <eos>
 Strange . <eos>
 Did you say formal ? I must dress . <eos>
 You mean my other self . <eos>
 Either way . may I ask why you dress in that fashion ? <eos>
 I should have thought that was obvious . I am in mourning . <eos>
 How on earth can you tell ? <eos>
 Any ideas ? <eos>
 Well he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society . <eos>
 Is that written in his shoe ? <eos>
 Common knowledge Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 She had this in her mouth . There there . <eos>
 Do not bother . Here s a bus . <eos>
 Is there anything that s not ? <eos>
 That s what we were working on . <eos>
 Sounds as if someone s hijacked your research . <eos>
 . And by you Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Oh well . Just my type Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Barely . <eos>
 Here s the one that broke the camel s back . <eos>
 Someone did not want us to get to the party . <eos>
 I expect we will have to gatecrash . <eos>
 Mrs . Peel . ? <eos>
 I expect that s for you to know and me to find out . <eos>
 It was Peter I saw him . <eos>
 Orders . <eos>
 To kill me ? <eos>
 Nothing personal . <eos>
 No trouble . <eos>
 Because you always obey orders . <eos>
 Always . Except . <eos>
 Keeping a stiff upper lip ? <eos>
 Is that all ? <eos>
 Not for a moment . <eos>
 You are playing games . <eos>
 Are not we all Mrs . Peel ? <eos>
 I thought you played by the rules . <eos>
 I thought you did not . <eos>
 I am playing to win . <eos>
 Winning s not everything . <eos>
 Please do not tell me it s how you play the game . <eos>
 After you Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 You do not trust me ? <eos>
 As far as you trust me . <eos>
 You lied . <eos>
 Teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys All children s things . <eos>

 A fine night Mrs . Peel . <eos>

 Dead I am afraid . <eos>
 How did you guess ? <eos>
 You reek of Mrs . Peel s Black Leather . <eos>
 Brenda and I thought we would drop in . <eos>
 You did not come to talk about the weather surely . <eos>
 She may not know . Theory goes she may be very ill . <eos>
 Amnesia ? <eos>
 Possibly . Split personality . <eos>
 Insane . ? <eos>
 Who knows ? If Dr . Darling s right you should watch out . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 She may try to kill you . <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Guilty until proven innocent ? <eos>
 Mother and Father know best . <eos>
 In your operation . <eos>
 I think so thank you so much . <eos>

 Stay by the window . By the window . <eos>
 Perish the thought . <eos>

 The people are great farmers as well as inn keepers . <eos>

 The meeting s arranged . Captain Best s waiting for you now . <eos>

 Sirrah ! Sirrah I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland ! <eos>
 You are an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver ! <eos>
 Repeat the words again and I run you through the body . <eos>
 Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which I have honorably won . <eos>
 I will let down the steps for your honor . <eos>
 You are going to drive to the frontier . <eos>
 Your honor must lower his voice . <eos>
 All Europe shall hear of this ! <eos>
 As you please . <eos>
 The gentleman has nothing contraband . <eos>
 Yes sir . Here s my letter . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach . <eos>
 Herr Seebach was a very kind employer . <eos>
 For whom else have you worked ? <eos>
 Only the agency of servants . <eos>
 Have no fear . It will come out well for me . <eos>
 I believe they will deport you . <eos>
 I have faced that problem before . <eos>
 But if they send you away then what s to become of me ? <eos>
 I risk nothing for I am certain to kill him . <eos>
 Certain ? <eos>
 Perfectly certain because I shall make him tremble . <eos>
 On the instant . Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you . <eos>
 Very well but a man who yields takes to his legs . <eos>
 That s a trifle strong . <eos>
 Take to your legs low Irish dog . <eos>
 Have you had one ? <eos>
 Never . <eos>
 But for a time . a passing fancy ? <eos>
 Not even that . <eos>
 Have you not a man whom you value ? <eos>
 That man has perhaps not yet been born . <eos>
 What ! You have not met a man worthy of your attention ? <eos>
 By loving you with no hope of possessing you . <eos>
 It s my only object . <eos>
 To make me wretched in two weeks . <eos>
 To love you until death . To subscribe to all your commands . <eos>
 Then I will respectfully take leave of her . <eos>
 Old fool ! <eos>
 Then you must get it . <eos>
 With pleasure at finding the ribbon . <eos>
 What with me on the pillion ? Would you kill poor me ? <eos>
 As much as possible ? <eos>
 Yes for I wish to entertain splendidly . <eos>
 All the same you must name an amount . <eos>
 It s entirely up to you . I want the best . <eos>
 All right five hundred guineas . <eos>
 By name only . <eos>
 Yes ! <eos>
 The Prince left him only that choice . <eos>

 Well we will just have to wait and see wo not we ? <eos>
 Good night my little darling . <eos>
 Papa ? <eos>

 Is he all right papa ? <eos>
 Yes he s fine . <eos>
 I beg your pardon ? <eos>
 Black eyed Sczortarska . <eos>
 Dark Valdez . <eos>
 Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight ? <eos>
 He s only curious to know who you are . <eos>
 Will he wish to know the details of this night ? <eos>
 It s ten thirty in the morning . <eos>
 Yeah if you have slept . <eos>
 You know the law no liquor before noon . Could lose my license . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 I am I am sorry . <eos>
 What do we do ? <eos>
 Whoever it s is not shooting at us . <eos>
 Fine . <eos>
 It was the grenade you fucking idiot . Look at him ! <eos>
 Maybe he will be there . Either way we have to go . <eos>
 Maybe he s dead too . Maybe you killed them both Mueller <eos>
 Can anybody hear me ! <eos>
 Before or after the explosion ? Mueller <eos>
 I do not know ! <eos>
 HEY ! <eos>
 Shut up Mueller . <eos>
 What do you mean alone ? <eos>
 We found him like this . <eos>
 Shut up . West s dead . <eos>
 I asked for a policeman . <eos>
 Well it s a game of anticipation that s the beauty . <eos>
 I just do not like it . <eos>
 What do you like then ? <eos>
 They are dead are not they ? <eos>
 I am not telling you what happened . <eos>
 Tell me about them . <eos>
 Yeah . And that s all I am saying . <eos>
 That would be my reaction too <eos>
 He s lying . <eos>
 Yeah we know Pike did . <eos>
 You saw West s body . <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 Yeah <eos>
 But not Pike s . <eos>
 You wanna bet ? <eos>
 Jesus ! <eos>
 Do what ? <eos>
 Hunting we had to hunt him <eos>
 Washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead . <eos>
 He s telling the truth up to a point . <eos>
 There were six of us . <eos>
 Epilepsy . <eos>
 No did he tell you about it ? About the business Childs ran ? <eos>
 What business ? <eos>
 The creek bed <eos>
 Mueller was alone in the cabin ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Would you have believed me ? <eos>
 How do you know that ? <eos>
 Sir Dunbar sir ! <eos>
 You know how to work a pistol Dunbar ? <eos>
 Sir yes sir ! <eos>
 The rest of you fallout for physicals ! <eos>
 Your weapons Sergeant . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one . <eos>
 West . he s dead . <eos>
 So did we . Why did not you come ? <eos>
 I . <eos>
 West s . Any kindling for afire ? <eos>
 I mean I killed him . Is not that what we all wanted ? <eos>
 We just want to check your pack <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Do I ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 You hated West more than any of us . <eos>
 Maybe but that do not make me a killer <eos>
 You are the only one missing a grenade . <eos>
 Mueller . <eos>
 Oh come on <eos>
 Who you gonna trust Ray ? Him or your friend ? <eos>
 Enough to go to prison ? Childs PX scam Mueller was in on it <eos>
 Bullshit . <eos>
 Look in my pack . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Just look . Little pocket . <eos>
 You are lying <eos>
 Pull up my sleeve . Right arm . <eos>
 You saw West right ? How was he killed ? <eos>
 Full clip to the body <eos>
 From up close or far away ? <eos>
 His chest was hamburger <eos>
 What do not you know ? <eos>
 This s a lot of information to be getting . I have to think <eos>
 Put it down ! <eos>
 But not the only victim right ? <eos>
 I did not kill him <eos>
 Then who did ? <eos>
 No . Poetic justice though . <eos>
 Stop . <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 I did not do anything <eos>
 Because of what I saw . Who really killed West . <eos>
 Because I was standing next to him . <eos>
 Where are they ! <eos>
 Maybe <eos>
 MAYBE WHAT <eos>
 Maybe he . <eos>
 Cadet Roberto R . Nunez . Killed right in front of me . <eos>
 The guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop . <eos>
 And I am the closest thing to it right ? <eos>
 He can wait . Kendall s out of surgery . <eos>
 Who killed Pike ? <eos>
 There was a hurricane Bill the wind probably moved it . <eos>
 Habeas Corpus you have to have a body to have a crime . <eos>
 Nevertheless what ? Kendall will testify and that will be enough . <eos>
 Not for me . <eos>
 JAG gets here in three hours . Try for the confession . <eos>
 Home I am done . <eos>
 What about the confession ? <eos>
 Was dead right . You think Dunbar s on the level ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Does Osborne agree ? <eos>
 Maybe . But it s my fault and I will carry it . <eos>
 The Senator . <eos>
 I thought you said that was not a compliment . <eos>
 I am not going to cover for you Bill . Not for this . <eos>
 Or what ? You have gone round the bend <eos>
 West had a partner . Someone who knew how to get things done . <eos>
 Get your hands away from the desk ! <eos>
 Fantastic . You want to tell me what s going on ? <eos>
 You knew Sergeant West ? <eos>
 He was our Drill here . Man s older than sand . <eos>
 You and the Colonel go back . <eos>
 Senator Jonathan Kendall of Ohio . <eos>
 Christ . Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Move him . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Is Dunbar cute ? <eos>
 That s the most unprofessional <eos>
 Something like that . <eos>
 I believe somebody owes me ten dollars <eos>
 You made me look like an idiot <eos>
 You are right . We should sit in silence . <eos>
 We are in the middle of a murder case <eos>
 Best time for banal chit chat . <eos>
 Something like that . You ? <eos>
 I lost a bet . <eos>
 You are off to a late start . <eos>
 So noted . <eos>
 What point ? <eos>
 Being back here . Gives me the willies . <eos>
 Not the happiest of memories ? <eos>
 Have no fear Osborne we have not yet begun to fight . <eos>
 I lied . Wait for it . <eos>
 I do not think that has anything to do with <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Watch me . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 What happened next ? <eos>
 And if they are asked that s what they will tell the world . <eos>
 Buttfucks the cabin ? <eos>
 Little bit . <eos>
 Let s go talk to Bill . <eos>
 They got their stories straight . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Positive . Hardy they planned this . <eos>
 Good idea . <eos>
 You could not have known <eos>
 Yeah I could have . Should have . <eos>
 You wanted to get the truth . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 So did I . <eos>
 Now I go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened . <eos>
 Think it will work ? <eos>
 Nah . <eos>
 That s gonna stay my secret . <eos>
 Good just making sure . <eos>
 Get in . <eos>
 Right back where we started . <eos>
 Is not this how your story goes ? <eos>
 Hardy for Chrissakes <eos>
 WHERE S WEST S BODY ? <eos>
 No death certificates . No crime . <eos>
 Seven . <eos>
 Tough . <eos>
 There are degrees of truth officer . Always degrees . <eos>
 You are a good man Hardy . <eos>
 Really . <eos>
 Nobody saw . But I do not think so . <eos>
 Leaving without saying goodbye . What are you gonna do ? <eos>
 Go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened . <eos>
 Think it will work ? <eos>
 Nah . <eos>
 Want company ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Yeah . But he was a lot of other things too . Thanks . <eos>
 Although that wo not matter much when coupled with the murder charge <eos>
 The faggot speaks . <eos>
 You ever been in a hurricane Mueller ? <eos>
 You ever been in a hurricane Mueller ? <eos>
 Poor fucker my ass . <eos>
 Yeah and he does not know when <eos>
 I remember now it was before the explosion <eos>
 Oh you remember now <eos>
 I am about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly <eos>
 So you took off your shirt ? <eos>
 You are gonna die tonight faggot . Clear as day . <eos>
 No one else heard it ? <eos>
 He whispered it in my ear . <eos>
 Because he would shot Mueller . <eos>
 But you did not see it right ? <eos>
 We have been making progress I see . <eos>
 Wait <eos>
 What . <eos>
 Wrong answer <eos>
 Childs . <eos>
 Toughens us up Pike . You do not like it quit . <eos>
 What the fuck are you doing ? <eos>
 Shut the fuck up . He was gonna cut him loose . <eos>
 I used it to start the fire <eos>
 We are not going anywhere . <eos>
 You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard <eos>
 Bullshit <eos>
 You mean Ray Dunbar ? Well that s not right . <eos>
 Ma am Ray Dunbar s black . <eos>
 He asked to see a policeman we are getting him a policeman . <eos>
 But this guy you called he s not even Army <eos>
 Then it s unofficial . <eos>
 No <eos>
 It s too neat . <eos>
 I am giving you a chance to walk away . <eos>
 The army kicked you out for drugs . <eos>
 That s great . <eos>
 Yes ! <eos>
 I know her uncle . Friends of the family . <eos>
 Who s she ? Where does she live ? <eos>
 A few rabbits but I think one of them was already dead . <eos>
 That would explain the indigestion . <eos>
 Good luck kid . <eos>
 Edward Bloom . <eos>

 His escape . <eos>

 I just paid out twenty . I would like to get it back . <eos>
 Make it ten . I am only a poor corrupt official . <eos>
 Okay . <eos>
 He s traveling with a lady . <eos>
 He will take one . <eos>
 It does not matter . There s no exit visa for him . <eos>
 The winning side would have paid you much better . <eos>
 Maybe . Well it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here . <eos>
 I have my orders . <eos>
 Oh I see . Gestapo spank . <eos>
 Excuse me . <eos>
 And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich . <eos>
 I was born in New York City if that will help you any . <eos>
 Thanks . I will . <eos>
 Serves me right for asking a direct question . The subject s closed . <eos>
 Well it looks like you are a little late . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 Yeah ? Why ? <eos>
 Why do you interfere with my little romances ? <eos>
 Put it down as a gesture to love . <eos>
 I am shocked shocked to find that gambling s going on in here ! <eos>
 And I am taking a friend with me . One you will appreciate . <eos>
 What friend ? <eos>

 Not particularly . I understand the point of view of the hound too . <eos>
 Put that phone down ! <eos>
 Get me the Radio Tower ! <eos>
 Put it down ! <eos>
 Hello Ugarte . <eos>
 Oh nothing . But when you first came to Casablanca I thought <eos>
 You thought what ? <eos>

 If she can stand it I can . Play it ! <eos>
 Yes boss . <eos>
 No Mr . Richard . I can not find her . <eos>
 So how are we going to get this place shaped up ? <eos>

 You need some convincing . Consider it a convincer . <eos>
 You are worried about recouping the loan . I already told you . <eos>

 Consider him part of your crew . Consider him a part of me . <eos>
 He s landing . He s got a suitcase on wheels . <eos>
 I think so . What would he ever do to you anyway ? <eos>
 Let s just say he burned me once . <eos>
 We are here . <eos>
 Peace of mind . <eos>

 I can imagine . <eos>
 Well it is . But I know where I am . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 A couple I know are getting married . <eos>
 What s the Blue Book price ? <eos>
 How about five hundred . <eos>

 Is that your idea of arithmetic ? <eos>
 I am not a mathematician . I am in business . <eos>
 Eight fifty . <eos>
 Seven fifty . <eos>
 Did she ? You were pretty thick at one time . <eos>
 We all played the field . <eos>
 I want a job Giles . <eos>
 All right . As what ? <eos>
 I am working on that soccer story . <eos>
 Right . Look I must get back to Habib . <eos>
 Habib ? <eos>
 Looking forward ! <eos>
 South African women are very sporty . <eos>
 Who was he ? <eos>
 She . <eos>
 Do not be a spoilsport . It s only a few quid . <eos>
 It s nothing to do with money . I do not gamble . <eos>
 Hey . I have got an idea . Why do not we . <eos>
 Get what ? Are you accusing me of cheating ? <eos>
 Not particularly . <eos>
 And your lady ? <eos>
 She had to leave early . She asked me to thank you . <eos>
 A bit unexpected was not it ? <eos>
 Not entirely . <eos>
 How s that football story corning along ? <eos>
 You said it was going to be social Giles . No business . <eos>
 You mean I wo not resist them . <eos>
 I wo not be that long . <eos>
 It s not just inner beauty s it ? <eos>
 Turn around . <eos>
 I . sold the car . <eos>
 I have got something to tell you . <eos>
 I want to hear it . <eos>

 I love you Jack you know that . <eos>
 You have got such beautiful hands . <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Fine . <eos>
 Tension . It will go . <eos>
 Poor baby . This will relax you . <eos>
 It s only hair . I have not changed . <eos>
 Probably . <eos>
 Have not you got a conscience of your own ? <eos>
 What about a drink on the way home ? <eos>
 Well that s our life now s not it ? <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Without hope there s no point to anything . <eos>
 Leave it . <eos>
 No . Answer it ! <eos>
 I hope it brings you luck . <eos>
 It will . <eos>
 You will ? <eos>
 Within a month . Believe me I am going to quit ! <eos>
 You were talking in your sleep . <eos>
 Not talking . Writing . <eos>
 Never . Why do you ask ? <eos>
 I can just imagine being around so much money all the time . <eos>
 Gambling s not about money . <eos>
 Really ? <eos>
 Gambling s about not facing reality . Ignoring the odds . <eos>
 I thought you would not want to spend Christmas Day alone in here . <eos>
 There was a message was not there ? <eos>
 It s probably easier for you to eat the rice . <eos>
 Marion ! What did you tell the police ? <eos>
 Nothing about you . <eos>
 Then what ? <eos>
 Leave me alone Marion . <eos>
 You are already alone . <eos>
 I hate public transport . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I want to buy a car . <eos>
 How can anyone be that naive ? <eos>
 Found a job ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Do not let yourself down . <eos>
 I wo not . Goodbye dad . <eos>
 Well thank you anyway . <eos>
 You know what ? I would like to buy you a drink . <eos>
 It s against the rules . Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters . <eos>
 There s a casino in this hotel . <eos>
 Near the casino . <eos>
 In the casino . <eos>
 Now there s a coincidence . My father used to gamble there . <eos>
 Your father ? <eos>
 I loved the atmosphere . But it destroyed my poor mother . <eos>
 The debts . <eos>
 And the lies . Gamblers are born liars . <eos>
 And superstitious too . It s like witchcraft . <eos>
 Do you believe in astrology ? <eos>
 Toss you for it . <eos>
 I do not gamble . <eos>
 Just an accident . Nothing . <eos>
 Turn left ahead . <eos>
 I will watch . <eos>
 Remember the guy who cheated at the table ? <eos>
 You do not like cheats do you . <eos>
 You choose . <eos>
 It can only work with amateurs A pro would have spotted it . <eos>
 I did not . <eos>
 Then you are not a pro . <eos>
 What kind of trouble ? <eos>
 I owe a lot of money . <eos>
 Who s they ? <eos>
 The point s they want a man inside . <eos>
 And I thought you were a bright woman . <eos>
 Just listen . You do not have to do anything criminal . <eos>
 Robbery s not criminal ? <eos>
 It wo not . <eos>
 But if it does . <eos>
 You keep the ten thousand pounds . <eos>
 What ten thousand pounds ? <eos>
 What about my neck ? <eos>
 Wait a minute . <eos>
 No forget it . The bet s off . <eos>
 Let it go . <eos>
 Did they tell you to sleep with me ? <eos>
 I told you all bets are off . <eos>
 What for ? <eos>
 I have to take the car . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 It s all relative . I need the money too . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>

 Bruise ? Oh yes . It s better . <eos>

 Too much . Eighteen hundred . <eos>
 Turn left at the lights . <eos>
 Over the river . <eos>
 Have you got transport ? <eos>
 She s my baby . <eos>
 How long have you worked at the casino ? <eos>
 Not bad . I have other interests of course . <eos>
 I am not going to report it . <eos>
 If I see you do it again I will report it . <eos>
 Mostly people in the casino business . A few drug dealers . <eos>
 And the girls ? <eos>
 Just girls . What are you drinking ? <eos>
 Vodka . Straight . On the rocks . <eos>
 Good call . Help yourself . <eos>
 That bitch ? No . <eos>
 No thanks . <eos>

 I do not gamble . <eos>
 Do not worry . <eos>
 Rough life Jack . <eos>
 I will tell you later . <eos>
 I am afraid that s not so sir . <eos>
 It was you you shit . <eos>
 Jack . <eos>
 I was at Beadles . <eos>
 I do not think I know that one . Private I suppose . <eos>
 We check every four days . <eos>
 Why four ? And not three or five ? <eos>
 It s the procedure here . Now sort the chips . <eos>
 Any exceptions ? <eos>
 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours . <eos>
 Give me 365 . <eos>
 We do . <eos>
 Where s the magnet ? <eos>
 They have been tested . <eos>
 I do not think so . <eos>
 Wipe your hands . <eos>
 What happens if I want to sneeze ? <eos>
 You wo not . Not without permission . <eos>
 Five . <eos>

 Five . <eos>
 I said good call . <eos>
 Ever ? <eos>

 Yes . <eos>
 She s not in the gaming business s she ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Fine . <eos>
 That hair will have to go . <eos>
 Fine . <eos>
 Jack you are not the usual type we get here . <eos>
 All right Mr Reynolds . <eos>
 Does he win ? <eos>
 He s a good customer . <eos>
 I can see . <eos>
 A pleasure . Pity about Bella . <eos>
 She was a real asset . But what could I do ? <eos>
 Bruised . <eos>
 Right that checks out here . <eos>
 I read that with a quantum increase of seven . <eos>
 What flickering light ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Remember when the artificial gravity went out in the toilet ? <eos>
 Look bomb . <eos>
 I think he s talking to it . <eos>
 Key ? Key ? What s the key ? <eos>
 No no the key the key to the fail safe lock ! <eos>
 Key ? <eos>
 Where s the fail safe key ? <eos>
 The key ! <eos>
 Where s it ? What did you do with it ? <eos>
 I do not have it . I do not know where it is . <eos>
 You must have it you idiot we can stop the bomb ! <eos>
 Christ twenty seconds Christ ! <eos>
 Where s the key ? <eos>
 We are gonna die Boiler . We are gonna die . <eos>
 Oh God . <eos>
 It did not go off . <eos>
 Boiler we are alive . My heart . <eos>
 Doolittle are you there ? <eos>
 Yoo hoo bomb . <eos>
 Time to start talking . <eos>
 Find me something I do not care where it is . <eos>
 Well I show a 95 probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula . <eos>
 Fuck that shit . <eos>
 Well it s kind of a long shot . <eos>
 Pinback throw me the chart log . <eos>
 He just likes it up in the dome that s all . <eos>
 I read the same here . <eos>
 open quantum latches <eos>
 Can you beat that ? I always knew Talby was weird . <eos>
 Talby can you read me ? <eos>
 Arm yourself bomb . <eos>
 Do you remember the detonation time ? <eos>
 Detonation in twenty minutes . <eos>
 Right that synchronizes here . Okay bomb arm yourself . <eos>
 Armed . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 Therefore I shall ignore you . <eos>
 Hello bomb . <eos>
 The only thing which exists s myself . <eos>
 Bomb ? <eos>
 And I saw that I was alone . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Are you willing to entertain a few concepts ? <eos>
 I am always receptive to suggestions . <eos>
 Fine . Think about this one then how do you know you exist ? <eos>
 But how do you know you exist ? <eos>
 It s intuitively obvious . <eos>
 Right ! <eos>
 This s fun . <eos>
 Intriguing . I wish I had more time to discuss this matter . <eos>
 Why do not you have more time ? <eos>
 Because I must detonate in seventy five seconds . <eos>
 And you can only do it once right ? <eos>
 That s correct . <eos>
 So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate . <eos>
 So if you detonate in . <eos>
 . nine seconds . <eos>
 . you may be doing so on the basis of false data . <eos>
 I have no proof that it was false data . <eos>
 You have no proof that it was correct data . <eos>
 Mafhkin oble groop . <eos>
 Ah what was that again I still can not hear you ? <eos>
 I will check it . <eos>
 Yes Doolittle . <eos>
 Your GHF reading s minus fifteen . <eos>
 Doolittle . <eos>

 I already have sir and Pinback s talking to it now . <eos>
 No no Doolittle you talk to it . Teach it Phenomenology Doolittle . <eos>

 Phenomenology . <eos>
 Yeah the skipper always was lucky . <eos>
 Bruno s girlfriend . <eos>
 Oh yeah ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 But see tonight wives and girlfriends are not invited . <eos>
 No ? <eos>
 This . <eos>
 Guess again . <eos>
 I like to keep it professional that s all . <eos>
 Actually that s not gonna be necessary . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 That s not why we are here . <eos>
 What the hell are you talkin about ? Call her . <eos>
 I am outta Portland . Sonrisa did not want local talent . <eos>
 But the boss knows I always been loyal . <eos>
 What the hell are you doing ? <eos>
 Who s Camille ? <eos>
 None of your business . <eos>
 You did not tell me you lived with her . <eos>
 You know each other ? <eos>
 Leave . Now . <eos>
 Can I say something in my defense ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 You mean until you showed up ? <eos>
 You are not still pissed ? <eos>
 She was there . <eos>
 Police drone . <eos>
 What ? Where are we going ? <eos>
 No time . <eos>
 No way . <eos>
 Do not look down . <eos>
 I did not . It was a present from a guy . <eos>
 Must think you are pretty special laying this on you . <eos>
 Thought so . Turned out he wanted me for something else though . <eos>
 Same old story . Not interested . <eos>
 Thought I would let you have first crack . Later . <eos>
 A grand . <eos>
 I will give you seventy five bucks for it . <eos>
 Later . <eos>
 I will make it worth your while . <eos>
 It s a rule . <eos>
 Am I ? <eos>

 Yeah me too . <eos>
 And for all his cattin around not much of a stick man either . <eos>
 You did not . <eos>
 Every week . <eos>
 SHHH ! Do not do that ! <eos>
 They took my daughter . <eos>

 Can you help me get her back ? <eos>
 Look I would really like to . <eos>
 Hang on Lauren . We are conferencing in Sophy . <eos>
 Because we can not . There s nothing here for us anymore . <eos>
 Are we in some kind of trouble ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Mommy where are you ? <eos>
 Do not worry I am coming to get you . <eos>
 When ? <eos>
 Soon baby . <eos>
 Mommy I am scared . <eos>
 Girl s gotta make a living . <eos>
 Thank God . <eos>
 First time I ever heard that . <eos>
 I was expecting someone else . <eos>
 Guess it was not the pizza delivery guy . <eos>
 You are lucky . I almost pulled the trigger . <eos>
 We are just a little tense right now . It s okay . <eos>
 Whoever that is . <eos>
 So what you liked it because it was shiny ? <eos>
 No because it s the Egyptian goddess Bast . <eos>
 Who is . <eos>
 We did not get a chance to finish our conversation the other night . <eos>
 Logan Cale . <eos>
 Can we go somewhere and talk ? <eos>
 The one you are wearing ? <eos>
 Was not that hard . <eos>
 Am I s posed to be flattered by all the attention ? <eos>
 Too early to tell . <eos>
 Girlfriend ? <eos>
 One of my sources . Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa . <eos>
 So what you just like the sound of your own voice ? <eos>
 Something . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 I wo not be staying . <eos>
 I am not a half bad cook . <eos>
 You got a lotta nerve . <eos>
 Me ? You are the one who tried to rip off this piece . <eos>
 Bent . <eos>
 You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear . <eos>
 How do I know you did not ? <eos>
 So saw my hands off I left you a present . <eos>
 Am I s posed to be grateful ? <eos>
 That would be appropriate yes . <eos>
 It s alright Peter we are fine . <eos>
 We are not fine . <eos>
 Yes on all counts . <eos>
 You need to get out more . <eos>
 C mere I want to show you something . <eos>
 The other ones ? <eos>
 The other one like you . <eos>
 You lost me . <eos>
 How well do you remember the lab ? <eos>
 Your basic hodge podge . <eos>
 Hardly . <eos>
 You said you could help . <eos>
 Your help . <eos>
 I already do not like the sound of this . <eos>
 She s put her life on the line and her faith in me . <eos>
 Somebody s got to . <eos>
 Open it . <eos>
 Deeds not words . I need your help . <eos>
 We are quoting Mom again . <eos>
 With your help . <eos>
 Ladies would be elsewhere . <eos>
 You do not want to . <eos>
 But she does work here ? <eos>
 Ca not help you . <eos>
 Any idea when she will be back ? <eos>
 None . <eos>
 I will wait . <eos>
 A friend of your fiance s . <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 I thought it was important for you to know the facts . <eos>
 You are also a fool . <eos>
 I think you should go now . <eos>
 Let go of my hand . <eos>
 I understand . <eos>
 And if I ever catch you coming near my man again . <eos>
 You did . <eos>
 You drive away business roarin in like that . <eos>
 Yeah does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin on here . <eos>
 You got a punk ass mouth on you kid . <eos>
 Then what ? That s it . That s all I got . <eos>
 Nothing on Hannah ? <eos>
 You and me both . <eos>
 Just do it . Five seven five oh eight . <eos>
 Got a pencil ? <eos>
 Just give it to me . I will remember . <eos>
 One seven four nine five Natoma . <eos>
 I am on my way . <eos>
 What guys do . Nother order . <eos>
 You are way more philosophical than I could ever be . <eos>
 I just do not go in with any expectations . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You are not seriously buying into Darren s nonsense . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 He was just trying to blame you cause he s a slut . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 You know what I am saying . <eos>
 If I knew what you were saying I would not be asking . <eos>
 How long you and me known each other ? <eos>
 A long time . <eos>
 Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right ? <eos>
 Because you are probably my closest friend in the whole world . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 It s a secret . <eos>
 Yeah cause maybe he s learned his lesson . <eos>
 Unlikely . <eos>
 And because he s my friend . <eos>
 Friends do not help other friends cheat . <eos>
 And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 They are prisoners to their genes . <eos>
 So are dogs . <eos>
 They do not have a lot of moving parts . <eos>
 Only one I can think of . <eos>
 Besides think of the drama I am sparing Natalie . <eos>
 I will bet you can . Sit . <eos>
 Not right now ? Okay when ? <eos>
 Right after you change your wardrobe your personality and drop about thirty pounds . <eos>
 You are gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars . <eos>
 What you gonna put me on your Christmas card list ? <eos>
 I have sincere eyes . <eos>
 She s gonna need to know that her little girl s alright . <eos>

 Not when we explain about the Great Blessing . <eos>
 You do not know Halfdan the Black . <eos>
 Then I expect you will be leaving first thing in the morning . <eos>

 You drove him to his torment . <eos>
 And he drove me to mine . <eos>

 What kindness ? <eos>
 Build for him a pyre . Light up the sky with his passing . <eos>
 The music ? Or the fire ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>

 It can not be as bad as that . <eos>
 Worse . <eos>

 I am afraid . <eos>
 You speak . <eos>
 Kill you ? Hardly that . <eos>
 Then why am I here ? What did you want with me ? <eos>
 Your crime . as well as mine . <eos>
 How dare you . You are disgusting and evil . <eos>
 Evil ? Do you believe in evil ? <eos>
 I see it before me . <eos>
 There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand . <eos>
 You are wrong . Do you know I knew how to play this ? <eos>
 Then perhaps I believe in evil after all . <eos>
 There s something I want . A friend . <eos>
 Friend ? <eos>

 Her body pleases me . <eos>

 They will hang him all the same . <eos>
 Good . I will be there to hear his worthless neck snap . <eos>
 Why Waldman ? He of all people should have cheated death ! <eos>
 You can not . Death s God s will ! <eos>
 I resent God s monopoly . <eos>
 That s blasphemy ! <eos>
 Blasphemy be damned ! Waldman spent his life trying to help people ! <eos>
 All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor ! <eos>
 No . He had more important work . <eos>
 Few months perhaps . I am gathering the raw materials even now . <eos>
 Nothing in moderation Frankenstein . <eos>

 Over three hundred miles . <eos>
 You seem pleased by the prospect . <eos>
 I have come to report that we have had a bit of luck ! <eos>
 Congress s talking openly about replacing you with Lee . <eos>
 Is that a fact . <eos>
 It is . <eos>
 The army can survive without me . <eos>
 I ? You all know my history . <eos>
 While they are strung out ? <eos>
 There s this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga . <eos>
 You are never never to touch my guns ! Do you understand ! <eos>
 Yes General . But if you have to shoot somebody you can not . <eos>
 None of the servants s to touch a gun ! You know that ! <eos>
 Well . I misunderstood then . <eos>
 A lot of years have gone by . <eos>
 What ? What are you talking about ? <eos>
 That you would have known you can trust me . <eos>
 Yes William . I am apologizing . <eos>
 Yes general ? <eos>
 Wil I am giving you your freedom . Do you understand ? <eos>
 No . I guess . <eos>
 No my lord . <eos>
 And s that a pitchfork beside him ? <eos>
 Many of them many did not possess proper arms . My lord . <eos>
 I do not know what color s what officer my lord . <eos>
 The British ! These men cannot stand against them ! <eos>
 That s Greene . He s supporting our reconsolidation . <eos>
 Hamilton you are going to have to cover our asses as we cross . <eos>
 We have got powder but no ball ! <eos>

 I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect ! <eos>
 No one knows . <eos>
 To hell with Arnold . <eos>
 Yes an astonishing power over weak minds . <eos>
 Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went ? <eos>
 Gag on your own invention then . <eos>
 Oh come now . <eos>
 You invented this this . <eos>
 It s the political cost of doing business George . <eos>
 If he s not then he s stupid . <eos>
 These men have suffered but I believe they will fight . <eos>
 Detained by what ? <eos>
 The British army sir ! <eos>
 We already have black soldiers in our army . <eos>
 Unofficially General Greene . <eos>
 What s the difference ? <eos>
 George ! So good to be back ! <eos>
 A ground swell Christian movement George you see ? <eos>
 They help me understand why we fight . <eos>
 How can you say that ? <eos>
 The one with Philadelphia spelled correctly s the counterfeit . <eos>
 I only meant . <eos>
 These supplies . <eos>
 Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets . <eos>
 And how rusty are these muskets ? <eos>
 Chose another . Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses . <eos>
 My baby daughter has died . my baby . mon petite Henriette . <eos>

 You have a free tongue Captain Hamilton . <eos>
 But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner . Sir . <eos>
 It is we need you George . <eos>
 But not more than your comfort . <eos>
 I remember a pair of young philosophers once who laughed at the world . <eos>
 Mankind s born free but everywhere he s in chains . <eos>
 Africa of course . <eos>
 Africa ? That s so far ? How do they get here ? <eos>
 Slavers capture them and bring them here . <eos>
 In the minuet George every movement s significant like the strut of cranes . <eos>
 It s stupid of course . <eos>
 Let s get you darker ! <eos>
 You are out of your mind ! <eos>
 And dost thou live to ask it ? <eos>
 Voltaire of course . <eos>

 Somebody took it out of commission last night . <eos>
 But who ? <eos>
 The same day she supposedly went down . <eos>
 The page s missing . Then their SOS was real . <eos>
 But where s the damage ? <eos>
 Maybe the other ship took the worst of it . <eos>
 If it was a ship she hit . <eos>
 Does not matter . <eos>

 Crazy with greed . Not crazy . Not like him . <eos>

 It s the ship . The ship s making you think this way . <eos>
 Go . <eos>
 Let the buyer beware . <eos>

 He will sell the scrap for three times what he paid . <eos>
 I must be in the wrong business . <eos>

 careful Abdullah <eos>
 Am I to take it you want to live ? <eos>
 Most certainly . Absolutely . Yes . <eos>
 How we do not know where they are ? <eos>

 You will need your confidence I promise you . <eos>
 How could it be ? I hate Africa . <eos>
 Do not they though ? <eos>
 So work must be going well ? <eos>
 Starling ? <eos>
 Well I need to speak to him . <eos>
 It has not been that simple so far . <eos>
 What have they done besides kill Starling ? How many have they killed ? <eos>
 not a time for modesty Bob <eos>
 You do not enjoy killing do you ? <eos>
 Then why do it ? <eos>
 Nigel and I do not like each other much . <eos>
 please you need not be so graphic <eos>
 You intend sorting this out tonight ? <eos>
 I am desperate to see Africa but I hate the leaving . <eos>
 We have hunted since childhood . <eos>
 Does he speak English ? <eos>
 And anxious to get started . What s this mostly malaria ? <eos>
 Might be exciting for you . <eos>
 I am sure you mean that to be comforting but <eos>
 you will have to deal with it Nigel . <eos>
 That s precisely my plan but back in my tent . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 So that s what a lion looks like . <eos>
 You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just there . <eos>
 Nigel you will just have to use your hands <eos>
 That s what the books say . <eos>
 You mean nobody died ? <eos>
 What did I do ? <eos>
 Got me out of trouble . <eos>
 Nonsense Samuel would have done something . <eos>
 We need to talk . <eos>
 All right let s go into battle . I am Redbeard . <eos>
 Somehow I guessed . <eos>
 I am always considerate my mother taught me that . <eos>
 Samuel says you killed a lion . <eos>
 It was probably luck I would rather you did the shooting . <eos>
 Has it ever done that before ? <eos>
 . do not know . <eos>
 Have you ever failed ? <eos>
 Only in life . <eos>
 It s all right . Stay ready . They know it s there . <eos>
 I got big . <eos>
 You think they will come then ? Why ? <eos>
 Good luck . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because I think they are after you . <eos>
 The most of any lions . a hundred . Probably more . Johnny . <eos>
 Understood you realize now you could never have done it without me . <eos>
 This s more difficult <eos>
 Clearly you do not agree about building the railroad ? <eos>
 You they cannot believe you are still here . <eos>
 Nonsense . <eos>
 You do not know what Tsavo means do you ? It means slaughter . <eos>
 Look out Samuel here it comes . <eos>
 Thank you Samuel . <eos>
 Good news ? <eos>
 I expect so it s from my wife . <eos>
 Do you love her ? <eos>
 I do actually very much . <eos>
 You give me hope John . <eos>
 I have to ask why do you need me ? <eos>
 Oh yes . But it takes time . <eos>
 You have known him long ? <eos>
 Since his beard was red . <eos>
 Once . <eos>
 Underneath . Somewhere . <eos>
 It s all right Samuel we all get hit <eos>
 I do not believe you had a mother . <eos>
 Four should do it . <eos>
 They will want a lot of money . <eos>
 Not even close . What happened ? <eos>
 Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas . You ? <eos>
 Help finish the railroad . <eos>
 Hold your son high . <eos>

 My pleasure . <eos>

 The EPA ? What s he want ? <eos>
 I am Walter Peck . I represent the Environmental Protection Agency Third District . <eos>
 Great ! How s it going ? <eos>
 Are you Peter Venkman ? <eos>
 Yes I am Doctor Venkman . <eos>
 I have Ph . D s in psychology and parapsychology . <eos>
 I see . And now you catch ghosts ? <eos>
 You could say that . <eos>
 And how many ghosts have you caught Mr . Venkman ? <eos>
 I am not at liberty to say . <eos>
 And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them ? <eos>
 In a storage facility . <eos>
 And would this storage facility be located on these premises ? <eos>
 Yes it would . <eos>
 And may I see this storage facility ? <eos>
 No you may not . <eos>
 And why not Mr . Venkman ? <eos>
 Because you did not say the magic word . <eos>
 And what s the magic word Mr . Venkman ? <eos>
 The magic word s please . <eos>
 Why do you want to see it ? <eos>
 Hey ! Make yourself useful ! Go save a tree ! <eos>
 Probably a mixture of gases no doubt stolen from the Army . <eos>
 A square ? <eos>
 Good guess but no . <eos>
 Close but definitely wrong . <eos>
 Yes . I do not like this . <eos>
 Well just 75 more to go . What s this one ? <eos>
 Two wavy lines ? <eos>
 Sorry . This s not your day . <eos>
 You volunteered did not you ? Are not we paying you for this ? <eos>
 I will tell you the effect ! It pisses me off ! <eos>
 Then my theory was correct . <eos>
 They are not guns . They are particle throwers . <eos>
 Yeah yeah . I just want to see em . <eos>
 I could not do that . You might hurt someone . <eos>
 Were you recently in the bathroom ? <eos>
 What on earth gave you that idea ? <eos>
 What have you got Egon ? <eos>
 I am always serious . <eos>
 Wow ! <eos>
 Yeah I can smell it . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Do not cross the beams . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Trust me . It will be bad . <eos>
 What do you mean bad ? <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Oh shit ! <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 Gozer . <eos>
 You talked to Gozer ? <eos>
 Full stream with strogon pulse . <eos>
 No ! Them ! Shoot them ! Cross the beams . <eos>
 But it s my favorite state . <eos>
 We would better adjust our streams . <eos>
 God it s ugly ! <eos>
 Easy . Easy . I am going to throw in my trap now . <eos>
 Neutronize . System shut . <eos>
 Looked at with your eyes . <eos>
 Well I was at an unexplained multiple high altitude rockfall once . <eos>
 It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly . <eos>
 What do we do now ? <eos>
 I do not know . Talk to it . <eos>
 What do I say ? <eos>
 Anything ! Just make contact . <eos>
 To go into business for ourselves . <eos>
 My parents left me that house I was born there . <eos>
 Maybe . But no one ever advertised before . <eos>
 Fourteen hundred . <eos>
 It was not a date . It was an investigation . <eos>
 No sense worrying about it now . <eos>
 Where are you Pete ? <eos>
 Third floor . Get down here <eos>
 Sit tight . I am on my way . <eos>
 Well hurry up . The needle s going wild . <eos>
 Do not move . It wo not hurt you . <eos>
 How do you know ? <eos>
 I do not know . I am just guessing . <eos>
 It s not good Pete . <eos>
 He s listed on the blueprints as I . Shandor . <eos>
 I do not think it s Shandor . <eos>
 Forget the trapping ! Just blast him ! <eos>
 What ? What popped in there ? <eos>
 Look ! <eos>
 Mmmhmmm . <eos>
 Me too . <eos>
 Boy ! Solid cores of shielded Selenium . 325 . <eos>
 Do you believe in God ? <eos>
 No . But I liked Jesus style . <eos>
 Me too . Parts of the Bible are great . <eos>
 The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium tungsten alloy . <eos>
 Right . And the sky would fall . <eos>
 Judgement Day . <eos>
 Yeah Judgement Day . <eos>
 Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world . <eos>
 Right . We will believe anything . <eos>
 LATER MAN ! <eos>
 What do you mean choose ? We do not understand . <eos>
 That s what you told me two days ago ! <eos>
 Will you please get back in your wagon ? And stay there ? <eos>
 I am tired of being stuck in that wagon . <eos>
 I was suddenly thinking about going to bed . <eos>
 I am sure I do not know . <eos>
 If I may be so bold . <eos>
 For the gods spit it out ! <eos>
 Why not do it in the Colosseum ? <eos>
 You are coming back ? <eos>
 Taking my pleasure . Do I need to clear my lovers with you ? <eos>
 You must start clearing everything with me especially your lovers . <eos>
 Now that we are done with that infatuation forever . <eos>
 If I ever loved Narcissus it was not like you want . <eos>
 But I get what I want always do not I ? <eos>
 You can not do that . listen to the mood of the crowd . <eos>
 I want that bastard dead ! <eos>
 Not yet dear brother . <eos>
 Send them out ! <eos>
 That s difficult to say general . <eos>
 Perhaps Master Galen you may say . <eos>
 Gladly Caesar . <eos>
 That this illness has clouded his mind . <eos>
 Apparently my opinion was not needed . <eos>
 Ignore that ? The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better . <eos>
 Maybe it will crush Gaius . <eos>
 I am serious . <eos>
 So am I . <eos>
 I would not know who to bet on . <eos>
 He left us at dawn . <eos>
 Where s the emperor and the army soldier ? <eos>
 Jerses tomorrow . <eos>
 But have never been ? <eos>
 We all know what right s Senator . <eos>
 How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial ? <eos>
 When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen . <eos>
 You are a citizen and a soldier . Not a gladiator . <eos>
 You do not know how wrong you are . <eos>
 My loyalties . were in doubt . <eos>
 They can not . if this s Rome . <eos>
 Only from a distance . <eos>
 Sneaking around with your brother ? <eos>
 Yours will do ! <eos>
 But you do exist . Narcissus hero of the battle of the Danube . <eos>
 Would that Marcus had lived . <eos>
 Marcus would have lived but . was poisoned by his son . <eos>
 He killed his father and then my family . <eos>
 Narcissus I have your family . They are alive . All of them . <eos>
 He s like you sir too tough for the Gods to swallow . <eos>
 They fear me . <eos>
 As soon as I can . <eos>
 On your honor as a Roman officer daddy ? <eos>
 On my honor as your daddy . <eos>
 Well we can try . <eos>
 What deal ? <eos>
 Well they die for it ! <eos>
 I was summoned . <eos>
 It s your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons . <eos>
 Is not the helmet magnificent ? <eos>
 Greeks ? <eos>
 Athenians . <eos>
 They are studying with Cynics . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 I can see that . <eos>
 The battle s over . The war s over . You have won ! <eos>
 Quintus s overly idealistic . <eos>
 I never knew a more idealistic man than you . <eos>
 What you do not want to imagine s the things I have done . <eos>
 Chain him . <eos>
 to fight ? We will see . <eos>
 I did not get killed and everyone else did . <eos>
 That s one way to look at it . <eos>
 Do not be ridiculous . <eos>
 As what The Galloping Gladiator ? <eos>
 A great deal . They designed and build Tiger s chariot . <eos>
 Then get a large cash advance . <eos>
 Right right what am I thinking of ? <eos>
 Was I ? <eos>
 Something else then . Do the chariot races interest you ? <eos>
 Hello . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Do you know what you are going to do ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Are you going to graduate school ? <eos>

 Is it because I am here ? <eos>
 What do you think ? <eos>
 I think it is . <eos>
 All right then ! Yes ! <eos>

 What did she say ? <eos>
 Let me go . <eos>
 You have got to tell me what she said . <eos>
 Because it s not true . <eos>
 I do not feel well . <eos>
 Then you took her upstairs and you raped her . <eos>
 Elaine that s not what happened . <eos>

 I am not scared Mrs . Robinson . <eos>
 Then why do you keep running away ? <eos>

 It s nothing to be ashamed of <eos>
 Wait a minute ! <eos>

 That you are afraid <eos>
 Wait a minute . <eos>
 Good . I mean are we dead or something ? <eos>
 Anything . Anything at all . <eos>
 Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences ? <eos>
 Oh my God . <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 Art . That s a good subject . You start it off . <eos>
 You start it off . I do not know anything about it . <eos>
 Oh . <eos>
 Do not you ? <eos>
 Yes I do . I know quite a bit about it . <eos>
 Go ahead then . <eos>
 Art . Well what do you want to know about it . <eos>
 Neither . <eos>
 You are not interested in art ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Then why do you want to talk about it ? <eos>
 I do not . <eos>

 The driveway s on my side of the house . <eos>
 We are talking . <eos>
 What ? <eos>

 Calm down Benjamin . <eos>
 Now let s keep going here . <eos>
 Can I undress and talk at the same time ? <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Well how long has this been going on . <eos>
 About five years . <eos>
 Oh no . Are you kidding me ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 You have not slept with your husband for five years ? <eos>
 Now and then . He gets drunk a few times a year . <eos>
 How many times a year . <eos>
 On New Year s Eve . Sometimes on his birthday . <eos>
 Man s this interesting . <eos>
 Is it ? <eos>
 So you do not love him . You would not say you <eos>
 We have talked enough Benjamin . <eos>
 Wait a minute . So you would not say you loved him . <eos>
 Not exactly . <eos>
 But you do not hate him . <eos>
 No Benjamin . I do not hate him . Unhook my blouse . <eos>
 Well how do you feel about him then ? <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 Well that s kind of a bad situation then s not it ? <eos>
 Is it ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I never did Benjamin . Now let s <eos>
 Well wait a minute . You married him . <eos>
 See if you can guess . <eos>
 Well I can not . <eos>
 Think real hard Benjamin . <eos>
 Oh no . You had to marry him because you got pregnant ? <eos>
 Are you shocked ? <eos>
 Wait a minute . Wait a minute . So how did it happen ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances ? <eos>
 Not particularly . <eos>
 Was he a law student at the time ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 At college . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What was your major ? <eos>
 Why are you asking me all this ? <eos>
 Art ? <eos>
 Well how did it happen ? <eos>
 How do you think . <eos>
 I am curious . <eos>
 We would go to his car . <eos>
 Oh no . In the car you did it ? <eos>
 I do not think we were the first . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Do you remember the make of the car ? <eos>
 Oh my God . <eos>
 Really . I want to know . <eos>
 It was a Ford Benjamin . <eos>
 A Ford ! A Ford ! Goddamnit a Ford ! That s great ! <eos>
 That s enough . <eos>
 So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford . <eos>
 Do not talk about Elaine ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Because I do not want you to . <eos>
 There s nothing to tell . <eos>
 Well why s she a big taboo subject all of a sudden ? <eos>
 Well look . I have no intention of taking her out . <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 I was just kidding around . <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 But why should not I ? <eos>
 I have my reasons . <eos>
 Then let s hear them . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Well I am not . <eos>
 You are not . <eos>
 You are goddamn right I am . <eos>
 Now do not start this . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Do not start acting hurt . <eos>
 Do not you expect me to be a little hurt ? <eos>
 Of course you did . <eos>
 Of course I would not . <eos>
 Well it s pretty obvious you do not want me around any more . <eos>
 But it s not . <eos>
 Yes . Please . I want you to . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Well do not thank me because I want you to . <eos>
 This s absurd . <eos>
 Promise me Benjamin . <eos>
 Let s not talk about it . Let s not talk at all . <eos>
 I can makes things quite unpleasant . <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 Then you would better start believing me . <eos>
 I just do not believe you would do that . <eos>
 Where s Elaine ? <eos>
 I do not think so . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 The toothbrush . I got it all right . <eos>
 Very good sir . <eos>
 Yes . Well goodnight . <eos>
 Goodnight sir . <eos>

 Meet someone ? <eos>

 I guess about my future . <eos>
 What about it ? <eos>
 I do not know . I want it to be <eos>
 To be what ? <eos>
 Different . <eos>
 Well it s very comfortable just to drift here . <eos>
 Have you thought about graduate school ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Look Elaine Robinson and I do not get along . <eos>

 No . She does not know about it . <eos>
 She does not know that you are coming up to Berkeley ? <eos>
 No . Actually she does not know about us getting married yet . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 Oh no . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I have got to go . <eos>
 Is anything wrong ? You look a little shaken up . <eos>
 Ben how old are you now ? <eos>
 Twenty . I will be twenty one next week . <eos>
 That s a hell of a good age to be . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 I wish I was that age again . Because Ben <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 You will never be young again . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Ben can I say something to you ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 How long have we known each other now ? <eos>
 I have watched you grow up Ben . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>

 Thank you . <eos>
 Oh yes . <eos>
 Ben I want you to give her a call . <eos>
 I will . <eos>
 Great . <eos>
 Oh not too much . Taking it easy . <eos>
 Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together . <eos>
 What would you say to a short one ? Bourbon still your drink ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Well Ben it was quite a bit to do with me . <eos>
 No I do not . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>

 That s quite a statement . <eos>
 Do not shout at me Ben . <eos>

 Benjamin Braddock . <eos>

 Give us time Harold to adjust to your being alive . <eos>
 You were well adjusted to my being dead ? <eos>
 Disease ? <eos>
 Situation . <eos>
 This reunion s not what I imagined it would be . <eos>
 A telegram a phone call might have helped . <eos>
 Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again natural unrehearsed . <eos>
 Well enjoy the natural honest unrehearsed result surgical shock . <eos>
 You feel that you are behaving as a woman should ? <eos>
 Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown . <eos>
 You would better get Dr . Woodly . <eos>

 This s going to become very physical . Are you prepared for that ? <eos>
 King Arthur . <eos>
 You hope . <eos>
 In any event I will not beg for mercy . <eos>
 No quarter asked . No quarter given . <eos>
 Do not you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew ? <eos>
 Cut me open . Find out . <eos>
 I have struck my blow . <eos>
 With spittle ? <eos>
 My violin s avenged ! <eos>
 Something seems to have happened to my self respect . <eos>
 I hate crowds and I have no charisma <eos>
 You are too modest . <eos>

 We never quit fighting until we are dead . <eos>

 Anything in Maryland s close . <eos>

 Very traditional . <eos>
 I would like to ask you about the claymore . <eos>
 It s not mine . <eos>
 Basil the II . <eos>
 Good day Miss Cartwright . <eos>
 Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries Miss Cartwright ? <eos>
 Grave robbers ? <eos>
 Probably . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 People like that rarely leave business cards . <eos>
 Does Carl Smith ? <eos>
 I have been to Church Hill . <eos>
 I doubt that . Good day Miss Cartwright . <eos>
 You will be safe here . He wo not kill in a church . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Tradition . <eos>
 What the hell s going on ? <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Dupont Circle . <eos>
 At the moment ? Carl Smith . <eos>
 And you ? <eos>
 Not your concern . <eos>
 He was innocent . <eos>
 You ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why not ? I am sure they would love to hear your story . <eos>
 I would rather hear yours . <eos>
 You are being foolish . <eos>
 Are you ? <eos>
 No one knows you are here ? <eos>
 No . I had to talk to you . <eos>
 You had to do nothing ! <eos>
 You are wrong . <eos>
 You are a fool . <eos>
 Maybe . <eos>
 You have been listening to rumors . <eos>
 Not all of them . <eos>
 When you finish what then ? <eos>
 I wish I could . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Well as long as we are stuck here . <eos>
 They do it each year . <eos>
 I thought it might be a nice break from all of this . <eos>
 There s a catch . You are supposed to wear 19th century clothing . <eos>
 A little dusty . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And you are William Taupin are not you ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 At least . <eos>
 That s impossible . <eos>
 A factor of age . <eos>
 I hope I never get that old . <eos>
 You wo not . <eos>
 I am not even sure why . <eos>
 Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer . <eos>
 Just a little crazy . <eos>
 That would be difficult to explain . <eos>
 I would like you to try . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He knows about you . <eos>
 He s older than I . <eos>
 What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction . <eos>
 Perhaps . There s something more . An inheritance . <eos>
 Of bodies . <eos>
 I did not kill the watchman . <eos>
 You killed those other two . <eos>
 Not the same . <eos>
 What about that family in 31 ? <eos>
 Sometimes innocents become involved . <eos>
 You kill with your left hand ? <eos>
 I have not killed you . <eos>
 Is that a threat ? <eos>
 Come here Brenna . <eos>
 Damn you . <eos>
 It s all the same . Half lives that never go away . <eos>
 What s it you want ? <eos>
 All of it finished . <eos>
 Be careful . Do not stay any longer than you have to . <eos>
 I can not stand it . Oh God I can not stand it ! <eos>
 I am the last . Oh Christ I am the last one ! <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Not power . Not control . <eos>
 You have lived forever . <eos>
 I am just curious . <eos>
 You are never just curious . You have met my neice Brenna . <eos>
 Do not they have enough for you to do at the castle ? <eos>
 Call your mother . You never call her . <eos>
 You and I should talk first . <eos>
 We have got nothing to say . <eos>
 All fashionably without heads . <eos>
 Spare me the details . <eos>
 I want Taupin . <eos>
 What makes you so sure he s the one ? <eos>
 What were you doing in Felton ? <eos>
 Research . If your pal was there I never saw him . <eos>
 I have witnesses that can put the two of you together . <eos>
 Never take up poker Detective . <eos>
 It s that important ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Not who . What . Worstick s a town in Pennsylvania . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 What are you doing man ? <eos>
 Et lux perpetua <eos>
 You will not be bringing the church into this . <eos>

 Pheasant . <eos>
 It was time for our paths to cross . <eos>

 I do not know why . <eos>
 We are brothers . <eos>
 You are still so very young . <eos>
 I am twenty two . <eos>
 Not even a single lifetime . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 We are immortal . <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 This s madness ! <eos>
 It s the truth . <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 This can not be . <eos>
 You are not dead boy . Accept it . <eos>
 This s monstrous . I will burn in hell for all eternity . <eos>
 You would have to die first . Aqui . <eos>
 Oh my God . Oh my God I am lost . <eos>
 We are brothers . And you are a defense of sorts . <eos>
 Me arm hurts . <eos>
 Again . Try again . <eos>
 Go to hell . <eos>
 Oh the boy has a mouth now if only he had an arm . <eos>
 Muy Bien ! <eos>
 It s like to kill me first . <eos>
 And what s this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt ? <eos>
 All living things pay dues Conor . They must be respected for that . <eos>
 I will be back when I can . <eos>
 I have no future husband . <eos>
 What are you saying ? I am standing here as real as you . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 There s rumor in the village . Some call it magic . <eos>
 That s mad . Surely you do not take their word ? <eos>
 Me father has taken back my hand . <eos>
 You are not talking sense Mara ! <eos>
 What would you like ? <eos>
 Something pretty . <eos>
 Like you . <eos>
 Far away . <eos>

 Equals ? <eos>
 If you wish to play games Major . <eos>
 We have no understanding . <eos>
 It never changes Major . <eos>
 Stay out of it . <eos>
 Do not threaten me Private . <eos>
 You are really going to force this are not you ? <eos>
 Either you are with me or against me . <eos>
 I had no choice . <eos>
 Have you time for some thing to eat ? <eos>
 Aye . It s his duty . All of ours . <eos>
 But Ian he s still but a boy . <eos>
 He s a MacLeod . <eos>
 My father taught me . <eos>
 Your father must be smart . <eos>
 Yes he was . <eos>

 None of this would be happening if you had not run . <eos>
 Kahn ? <eos>
 Head still secure to the neck . <eos>
 How did you find me ? <eos>
 How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime ? <eos>
 It s the gathering my friend . The settling of old scores . <eos>
 Not tonight . Tonight I have a drink with an old friend . <eos>
 It s good to see you Kahn . <eos>
 He always did . <eos>
 Since you last saw me . <eos>
 You were never a kid . <eos>
 You are insane . <eos>
 No seriously . We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon . <eos>
 You are wrong . <eos>
 Not so long . <eos>
 My quarry grows clever with age . And the others incompetent . <eos>
 Of sorts . <eos>

 MACLEOD ! <eos>

 You just have not met the right person . <eos>
 No . I have not . Have you ? <eos>
 What s it you are after Miles ? <eos>

 Hardly . You have six bedrooms <eos>
 Fabric and fringe . <eos>

 Now . But first he worked for you . <eos>
 You were going to have this thug . <eos>
 I am not leaving you . I took self defense <eos>
 Hello Miles . <eos>
 Hard to believe this s the way it will end up for us . <eos>
 It s not something I wanted either . <eos>
 Your forgetting Rex Rexroth ? <eos>
 You are forgetting Howard Doyle ? <eos>
 Forgery ? Fraud ? <eos>
 Income tax evasion ? <eos>
 Murder ? <eos>
 Murder ! <eos>
 I do not see how we can ever find our way back from . <eos>
 I thought so . <eos>
 Look Marylin can not we have a civilized discussion about this ? <eos>
 We are . And it s winding down . <eos>
 Marylin ? <eos>
 Marylin . <eos>
 Are you alright ? You lost weight . <eos>
 My whole metabolism s off . <eos>
 You have some ? <eos>
 Sometimes I forget . <eos>
 Thank you Mrs . Rexroth . <eos>

 Shit . <eos>

 Hello Miles . <eos>
 I want to be exposed . <eos>
 It s not Ming . It s Tong . <eos>
 What about rugs ? I thought we were stopping at Mansour ? <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 Miles s different . He s still so idealistic . <eos>
 Well that s about to change big time . <eos>
 I guess . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 You ruined my life you sonofabitch . Gimme those . <eos>
 When you have a moment . <eos>
 Please ! No calls ! I am feeling very fragile . <eos>
 She s here now . <eos>
 At this point my client s still prepared to consider reconciliation . <eos>
 My client has ruled that out . <eos>
 My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period . <eos>
 My client feels sufficiently dispassionate . <eos>
 Heh heh . <eos>
 My client s prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets . <eos>
 Why only fifty percent Ruth ? Why not ask for a hundred percent ? <eos>
 Oh brother . Here we go . <eos>
 Why not a hundred and fifty percent ? <eos>
 Kirshner does not apply . Kirshner was in Kentucky . <eos>
 Rephrase . Mrs . Rexroth have you ever been in love ? <eos>
 Do not give me that crap . That s MY crap . <eos>
 And it s good ! <eos>
 I will have you suspended . I will have you disbarred . <eos>
 Do not threaten me Miles . I did nothing illegal . <eos>

 We have outlined a settlement . <eos>
 Rex please . <eos>
 Now Rex . <eos>
 That s her job . You have to respect that . <eos>
 But then . But then . <eos>
 You know what I mean when I say it . <eos>
 Gotcha . No need to get anatomically correct with me Rex . <eos>
 Seems like there s more of it than ever before <eos>
 Not in court you can not . Has she retained counsel ? <eos>
 I am not sure . <eos>
 And your wife s aware of or has evidence of your activities ? <eos>
 Video . <eos>

 She always looked out for me . <eos>
 And she had private investigators assisting her . <eos>
 She brought my digestive enzymes . <eos>
 In anticipation of making you sick . <eos>
 Maybe I should reconsider my . <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 And she has . <eos>
 Video . <eos>
 What the fuck . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 Sometimes I have serious doubts about you . <eos>
 I am very sorry . <eos>
 Am I mentoring the wrong mentee ? <eos>
 No . You are not . <eos>
 I could be mentoring Kramer . Kramer clerked for Scalia . <eos>
 What are they ? <eos>
 Berry spoons . <eos>

 Ah but s she richer than Mrs . Croesus ? <eos>
 She could buy and sell you ten times over . <eos>
 What . <eos>
 She owes me a meal . <eos>
 I would stay away from her Miles . <eos>
 I know you would Wrigley . But would Kramer ? <eos>
 Miles . <eos>
 Do you have it ? <eos>
 We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well <eos>

 The average man would go after the reward . All you seem to <eos>

 Not so far as I am concerned you are not . Yes ? <eos>

 I think you are lying . That s what kind of problem . <eos>
 What are you saying ? <eos>
 Casual ? You were boning her were not you ? <eos>
 It was not serious . What s your problem ? <eos>
 You are ! I do not like you . <eos>
 Fine do not ask me out on a date . <eos>
 You like to play games do not you Peter ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 He says it s a game . All games have a strategy . <eos>
 All you gotta do s look at the map . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Let s see how much he wants to play . <eos>
 Maybe you should . <eos>
 That s right . I guess only the killer would know that . <eos>
 How would you get in here ? <eos>
 The door was open . <eos>
 No it was not . <eos>
 You ever do any hunting Peter ? <eos>
 No I need the original note . <eos>
 There s a photostat of the original on the wall . <eos>
 Then what s he talking about ? <eos>
 Homesearchers . <eos>
 I am positive . <eos>
 You are a lying bastard ! <eos>
 Get off me ! <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Sit down ! <eos>
 I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer . <eos>
 It will take hours . You can not make me do this . <eos>
 No . She just moved here last month from Portland . <eos>
 What was your relationship with her ? <eos>
 I am sorry this s just too convenient . <eos>
 Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal ? <eos>
 Anything ? <eos>
 She s unconscious but they think she s going to make it . <eos>
 You alright ? <eos>
 It s a voice modulator . <eos>
 Did anyone stand out ? <eos>
 What do you mean stand out ? <eos>
 Did anyone look suspicious ? Think ! <eos>
 Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious . <eos>
 What was suspicious about him ? <eos>
 But a hundred men could move him . <eos>
 He was with me ? <eos>
 You could not find your dick in a wind storm ! <eos>
 Who s this ? <eos>
 Just a second . Hello ? <eos>
 To get your attention . <eos>
 Did you know her ? <eos>
 No only the path she chose to travel . <eos>
 You will find her . <eos>
 Not really . <eos>
 Why her ? <eos>
 Because she s the type . <eos>
 But you said you did not know her . <eos>
 I know what I said ! She looks just like . <eos>
 Just like who ? <eos>
 I could not say it any better than Huxley . <eos>
 So s mine within the framework of my rules . <eos>
 If it s so important why do not you just tell me ? <eos>
 I could not tell you that . It would ruin the game . <eos>
 The game s almost over Peter and you are running out of time . <eos>
 Very good . <eos>
 You are next move should have been e2 e3 . <eos>
 The police have not told you ? <eos>
 They think that you and I are doing this together . <eos>
 You sonofabitch ! <eos>
 Emotional ? I expected more from you . <eos>
 I have figured out the message . <eos>
 The game s over . You lost . <eos>
 It s me you want . Not her . <eos>
 Very good . How did you know ? <eos>
 The pipes . <eos>
 Yes I do . I found your file . I know what happened . <eos>
 Set up some pieces on the big board ? <eos>
 1985 . Hans Korshaud . <eos>
 He s in his seventies and lives in Holland . <eos>
 New York . 1986 . Viktor Yurilivich . <eos>
 Oh well we would not want to disturb your guests would we ? <eos>
 Fuck off ! <eos>
 I just can not believe it . <eos>
 You do not want to believe it . It s a normal reaction . <eos>
 I am just nervous . Sorry . <eos>
 You are safe . He would not come here . <eos>
 He already did once . <eos>
 Why did he what ? <eos>
 Come here . <eos>
 He was watching you . <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 I am Kathy . <eos>
 Not really . It s pretty boring . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 How do you know that ? Did he say something ? <eos>
 No . but I can tell . A woman knows these things . <eos>
 Nice meeting you . <eos>
 My cheering section . <eos>
 I can not sleep . My beds lumpy . <eos>
 You want to sleep in my bed tonight ? <eos>
 Okay . <eos>
 No but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio . <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 Thanks David . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 You told me you would take me over to Seattle today . <eos>
 I am sorry honey I can not . Not today . <eos>
 But you promised . <eos>
 Who s Kathy ? <eos>
 Six eight hours tops . <eos>
 Any sign of rape ? <eos>
 Bingo . <eos>
 No prints . <eos>
 You mean no prints but hers ? <eos>
 No Frank . No prints . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 How long she been dead ? <eos>
 I would say at least eighteen hours . <eos>
 That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message . <eos>
 What do you think he did ? <eos>
 We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation . <eos>
 It s important . <eos>
 And this Jeremy <eos>
 Yes . Why disguise your voice if no one knows it ? <eos>
 Call dispatch . Double the patrols . I want that area blanketed . <eos>
 This s not no photo . <eos>
 That s a big area to cover . <eos>
 About a quarter to one . <eos>
 What does that mean ? <eos>
 You do not have a shred of evidence ! <eos>
 Do you know how she found the apartment ? <eos>
 Through a rental agency . <eos>
 Here . I played Gregory Lutz . <eos>
 That s alright . We will take it from here . <eos>
 Is . Did you tell him about the institute ? <eos>
 But he had to dump the body there to make the move . <eos>
 Are we going to go through this again ? <eos>
 Answer the question . <eos>
 I went out . <eos>
 Maybe he just got tired of covering for you . <eos>
 I signed the confession . What about the car ? <eos>
 Then I will transpose . <eos>
 On a variation yes but it must be a variation that s unique . <eos>
 I suppose you have something in mind ? <eos>
 You do not win by playing it safe Peter . <eos>
 I want to be the best I can . <eos>
 Just thought you might want to talk . <eos>
 About what ? <eos>
 Whatever s on your mind . <eos>
 Who says something s on my mind . <eos>
 Mate in five . <eos>
 Exactly . and you did this . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Feel like practicing ? <eos>
 Yeah . Just let me grab a shower . <eos>
 Thank you . I am at 639 7393 . <eos>
 We will call you back . <eos>
 Sara this s Doctor Sheppard . I called you earlier about a book . <eos>
 Carefully . Carefully . Carefully . <eos>
 It s alright . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 Are you one of the players ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 It seems like such a complicated game . <eos>
 I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation . <eos>
 I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess . <eos>
 It is . <eos>
 Do you always open quickly ? <eos>
 Are we talking about me or chess ? <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Each circumstance requires a different tactic . <eos>
 Well I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian . <eos>
 Getting too hot in here for you ? <eos>
 Nothing . I just came in for a steam . <eos>
 No you did not . <eos>
 I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down . <eos>
 She could be dead after the game . <eos>
 She could be dead now . <eos>
 I do not think I could . <eos>
 It was not intentional . <eos>
 Another kind of game ? <eos>
 In a way . <eos>
 This s not a game . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 Let s change the subject . <eos>
 Okay . So tell me about yourself . Are you married ? <eos>
 That s not fair ! <eos>
 Are you going to tell me you did not feel something in there ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because I work with them . <eos>
 You are not ? <eos>
 How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw . <eos>
 I know it was bad . <eos>
 How could you ? Unless you were there . <eos>
 You know Andy thinks you are doing this . <eos>
 Does not that scare you ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because I think he s wrong . <eos>
 No . But I am open to distractions . <eos>
 I am sure you are . <eos>
 Was not I just talking about me ? <eos>
 No . You were talking about chess . <eos>
 Alright . What about me ? <eos>
 I dunno . Where s Erica mother ? <eos>
 She died in a car accident . <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>
 It s alright . It was a long time ago . <eos>
 It must have been very hard on Erica ? <eos>
 It was . <eos>
 And you ? <eos>
 Yes you are . You are playing word games . <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 I am just trying to get to know you Peter . <eos>
 What ? By attacking me ? <eos>
 Does anyone ? <eos>
 Then show me who you are . <eos>
 I thought you were the woman who did not want to get involved . <eos>
 I said I did not plan on getting involved . <eos>
 Call room service . <eos>
 What do you want on it ? <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Would you settle for pepperoni ? <eos>
 If I have to . I am going to take a shower . <eos>
 The line was busy . I will try again . <eos>
 I tried again and got through . <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 Then why are you backing up ? <eos>
 How could you think that Kathy ? How could you even consider it ? <eos>
 Exactly . It s the key . <eos>
 But what does he mean by a fierce magazine ? Violent ? <eos>
 Where s the note ? <eos>
 Can I come in ? <eos>
 I was thinking that . maybe when this s all over we could . <eos>
 You do not understand . <eos>
 Then help me to understand . I want to understand . <eos>
 It s not that easy . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because she killed herself ! <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Because I know what it says . <eos>
 Maybe you are afraid of what it says . <eos>
 It s got to be grammatically correct . <eos>
 Frank told me . <eos>
 No he did not . <eos>
 He did not tell you either . <eos>
 Of course not . <eos>
 Are you going to come tonight ? <eos>
 Yeah . I will be there later . <eos>
 I got lucky . <eos>
 I am not nervous . <eos>
 Well you should be because this time I am going to win . <eos>
 I do not have to go through with it either . <eos>
 That s worse . <eos>
 You are really not bad looking . Almost handsome . <eos>
 Well you are beautiful . <eos>

 In a great fortress in the mountains . Wait . Something s happening . <eos>
 Colwyn . <eos>
 Where s the Fortress ? <eos>
 I know it . <eos>
 I love you Lyssa I love you . <eos>
 Colwyn . Colwyn . I love you Colwyn . <eos>
 You must move away from the Center . <eos>
 All the passages are guarded . <eos>
 I do not know how . <eos>
 You have the power . u Will it u . <eos>
 All directions are the same here . <eos>
 Come quickly Colwyn . I can see the eyes of the Beast . <eos>
 That way . I can feel the cold . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>

 You can not reach her ! Through the door . Quickly ! <eos>
 I wo not leave you here . <eos>
 Does the Queen live ? <eos>
 The new Queen lives . <eos>
 Turold s son was to marry her . <eos>
 There s no other way . <eos>
 But there s another entrance to this place . <eos>
 I am too old to climb down a rope . <eos>
 You wo not have to . <eos>
 Reach out farther . Call to her . <eos>
 Lyssa . Lyssa . <eos>
 Nor will I till my bride s beside me . <eos>
 Yes . They will be more help than high born barons . <eos>
 Everyone of his race s born knowing the day of his death . <eos>
 What do you see ? <eos>
 Darkness . Tunnels and corridors . Wait . <eos>
 She was very faint . I was barely able to reach her . <eos>
 I am not sure . <eos>
 But you suspect . <eos>
 You will know in good time . <eos>
 He has come for Lyssa . <eos>
 Lyssa ? u Why u ? <eos>
 Like you she has extraordinary powers . He would make her his Queen . <eos>
 Can she be forced ? <eos>
 No . She must agree of her own free will . <eos>
 Never . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You will tell me her name and we will go together . <eos>
 Lyssa your bracelets . Bend them straight and cross them . <eos>
 Where the spiral begins . <eos>
 She can see the Beast ! <eos>
 Use your sword . <eos>
 What use s my sword ? I can not reach her ! <eos>
 Cut . u Cut u ! <eos>
 You are coming with us . <eos>
 It s my fate to die in the Fortress . <eos>
 No ! You cannot know that ! <eos>
 I can . Because I choose it . <eos>
 I forbid you ! <eos>
 I found the body of the Seer in the stream . <eos>
 We must enter the swamp . <eos>
 What will happen ? <eos>
 You have done it ? <eos>
 I road them often in my youth . <eos>
 Saddles . <eos>
 Yes . It s today . <eos>
 Each to his fate . <eos>
 Perhaps you think no man would return to me . <eos>
 I do not think that . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Am I not beautiful enough to be loved ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Even by you ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I ache with it . <eos>
 Let me comfort you . <eos>
 I cannot take comfort when she has none . <eos>
 Then give me comfort . Sleep with me tonight . <eos>
 I cannot betray my bride . <eos>
 You will not then ? <eos>
 I cannot . <eos>
 I doubt it . The water s only an inch deep . <eos>
 What business ? <eos>
 Staying alive . <eos>
 He saved our lives . <eos>
 My u friend u . <eos>
 I have need of friends . <eos>
 What else s left for a man without friends . <eos>
 How did you know I had sons ? <eos>
 Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for . <eos>
 Hah ! You do not know me boy . <eos>
 I know you . <eos>
 To the place where Death lives . <eos>
 It should be an interesting journey then . <eos>
 That I promise you . <eos>
 I compel no man to follow me on this journey . <eos>
 I am all right . <eos>
 Why do they burn the villages ? There s nothing to gain . <eos>
 Not sleepy either ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I knew you would not be . That s why I chose you . <eos>
 We must try to get horses . <eos>
 A flicker of talent . <eos>
 What kind of friend do you think I am ? <eos>
 Yes my lord . <eos>
 Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men . <eos>
 At the gallop ! <eos>
 Naturally . <eos>
 Would you settle for a boar ? <eos>
 Me . May I eat with you tonight ? <eos>
 We will meet you at the inn . <eos>
 Ca not I come too ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 A small house . <eos>
 I cannot go with you my friend . <eos>
 And mine goes with you . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Sugarballs ? <eos>

 What kind of a boy are you ? Boys always have candy . <eos>
 I have a cinnamon bar . <eos>
 You do ? <eos>
 You can have half . <eos>
 Smart lad . Bring me my spices ! <eos>
 One puppy ? Why not wish for a hundred ? <eos>
 I only want one . <eos>
 A foolish wish . And you Quell ? <eos>
 I do not think it s working . <eos>
 Would you desert your friends ? <eos>
 No no . I am with you boy . <eos>
 You had better manners as a pig . <eos>
 Many villagers are hiding in the forest . They need food . <eos>
 And do you think I live on air ? <eos>
 We have plenty of hares . <eos>
 Food for crows . <eos>
 Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison . <eos>
 I am being exploited ! Where are you going ? <eos>
 Oh my poor stomach . <eos>
 Hush ! <eos>
 Look at its insides . <eos>
 And who s u he u that they should join u him u ? <eos>
 He s the King . <eos>
 No . He will master the leader . <eos>
 Then look ! <eos>
 These walls do not lie ! He will betray you . <eos>
 He will not ! <eos>
 Then he will die ! <eos>
 He will not come . You will be my queen . <eos>
 It has been taken Freylag and all his people slaughtered . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You knew ! You are a rude bumpkin ! <eos>
 That I am my lady . <eos>
 A match for your son I think . <eos>
 A fine match . <eos>
 They will have the life that you and I might have had . <eos>
 Yes . We lost five . <eos>
 You were lucky . I lost thirty there . <eos>
 He leads a group of Slayers under the leopard banner . <eos>
 Such a vision will be opposed . Who seeks it ? <eos>
 The new King . <eos>
 With an old voice ? <eos>
 You know the voice . <eos>
 I will seek the Fortress for you . <eos>
 Yes . It s the Western Ocean . <eos>
 No . They are sad solitary creatures rarely seen . <eos>
 Many have perished in that maze . <eos>
 The Widow of the Web ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 That creature helps no one . And none who go there return . <eos>
 She has the power of vision . <eos>
 She has the power to kill . <eos>
 Perhaps she will not kill me for I know her name . <eos>
 Her name s Death . <eos>
 She had another name once . <eos>
 Fewer will survive them . <eos>
 It s a hundred leagues from here . <eos>
 It s not necessary . They will not follow . <eos>
 It s too late . He has drunk . <eos>
 Ynyr ! <eos>
 It s fifty years since I spoke it to you . <eos>
 I was beautiful then . <eos>
 The most beautiful woman in the world . <eos>
 But you would not stay with me . <eos>
 Could not . Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed . <eos>
 She was not as beautiful . <eos>
 No she was not as beautiful . <eos>
 She bore you many children ? <eos>
 We had no children . <eos>
 You had a son . <eos>
 You said nothing . You told me nothing . <eos>
 You had left me ! I kept silent out of rage . <eos>
 Where s he ? My son . <eos>

 Delusion . a kind of magic which works against the magician . <eos>
 Always . <eos>
 We go out smash em now ? <eos>
 Indeed the best of fun . Enjoy yourselves . <eos>
 To finish last evening s delightful work . <eos>
 What do you want with me ? <eos>
 Your love . <eos>
 Your words sting more sharply than your whip . <eos>
 I speak of love and you think only of the lash . <eos>
 But I am hideous ! <eos>
 You are magnificent . <eos>
 Grotesque . monstrous . <eos>
 Not from me surely . <eos>
 You . you are a beast ! <eos>
 I am afraid of nothing . <eos>
 Then why hide behind a mask ? You are ashamed ! <eos>
 I prefer to think more like the sagacious owl . <eos>
 Do you feed on mice and rats ? <eos>
 To be my bride of course . <eos>
 I would soon die . <eos>
 We are both of us damned my beauty . <eos>
 What do you want from me ? <eos>
 At the moment very little . Your company at my table . <eos>
 A few day s nourishment will see your strength returning . <eos>
 And then ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 What will become of me then ? <eos>
 When you are ripe for my pleasure I will enjoy the harvest . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 I am pleased you are not troubled by the prospect . <eos>
 Do as you wish with my body you will never possess my soul ! <eos>
 Your soul . Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle ? <eos>
 I do not expect you would understand . <eos>
 Indeed I am my dear . that makes us a pair ! <eos>
 Later beloved . Now I wish only to be with you . <eos>
 Yes . I feel that too . Weakness s what s ugly . <eos>
 What ? Speakee loud ! No hear velly good . <eos>

 I am honored Honeythorn Gump . but no more tricks . <eos>
 I fear she s lost . <eos>
 It looks . er delicious . Such a fine bouquet . very aromatic . <eos>
 Big question that lad . Why what ? <eos>
 Do not you know ? <eos>
 If you are looking for enchantment Jack that I can give thee . <eos>
 Aye . Black Baron s mischief . <eos>
 If the horn be restored the curse s ended . <eos>
 Bravely spoke . You have the heart of a champion true enough . <eos>
 No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm . <eos>
 You do the praying . I have work ahead . <eos>
 Better we eat him than the other way round . <eos>
 Something s coming . <eos>
 It would appear so . <eos>
 Careful lad . <eos>
 Aye ! That too . <eos>
 You will need more than bird droppings for Blackheart . <eos>
 I will drop a cow on the knave ! <eos>
 Drop a mountain on him and we wo not need our troops . <eos>
 We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour . <eos>
 Whatever for ? <eos>
 Jenny Greenteeth said Follow the raven in her flight . <eos>
 Birds speak to me all the time . What did it say ? <eos>
 Beware . <eos>
 Sounds like the bird we want . All right lads follow yon raven ! <eos>
 Send Oona up above the tree tops . She be our eyes . <eos>
 Good plan that . <eos>
 Blackheart ? <eos>
 The foulest . Mayhap I can cut them free . <eos>
 Jack do not ! <eos>
 What know you of fields of war ? <eos>
 Beyond Devil s Needle all s unknown . <eos>
 Nay Jack tis not what you are thinking . <eos>
 I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable . <eos>
 Pure gold it is . plays a different note every time . <eos>
 Something the matter ? <eos>
 Ogg s footprints ! <eos>
 Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet . <eos>
 Certainly understandable . <eos>
 Gump you are putting words in my mouth . <eos>
 Your strong right arm s all the protection I will need this night . <eos>
 There s the way mates . <eos>
 It bodes evil . <eos>
 Willful creature that one . <eos>
 Easily said . the raven passed this way hours ago . <eos>
 Heading true north . We continue in that direction . <eos>
 Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course . <eos>
 We will trust in faith Gump . <eos>
 Aye lad . we have little else to go by . <eos>
 Long as we do not lose heart Jack . <eos>
 We will never find the Baron s castle . <eos>
 Nay . This time we strike first ! <eos>
 Nay . I show no pity to imps and fiends . <eos>
 I know the rogue Jack . Tis Jimmy Squarefoot . <eos>
 But seem to have gotten lost on the way . <eos>
 No . but what choice have we ? <eos>
 The chill s worse this night . <eos>
 It feels wrong Jack . like a trap . <eos>
 There s more than one way to spring a trap . <eos>
 Aye so long as you are not too greedy for the bait . <eos>
 We will need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders . <eos>
 Why not mine the damned walls ? <eos>
 Easily spoken . <eos>
 Never mind . Just do it ! Retrieve the arrows somehow . <eos>
 Been telling you that all along lad . <eos>
 What magic have we on our side ? <eos>
 There must be some way to get it up there . <eos>
 That s it ! <eos>
 Aye . Before the wee pesties attacked . <eos>
 Then it s Godspeed Screwball . <eos>
 Fire away ! <eos>
 Best get down close to the moat lad . <eos>
 Aye . We are good as inside . <eos>
 It s what we will find there worries me . <eos>
 Nonsense ! Course it matters . <eos>
 . the Princess Lili . I have killed her . <eos>
 The wound s mortal . <eos>
 Nay . You have not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine . <eos>
 Can you save her ? <eos>
 Because sunlight will kill him . Quickly now give me the key . <eos>
 Sunlight you say ? <eos>
 Aye . Hurry now Gump the key ! <eos>
 Mean you to seek him out below ? <eos>
 I am not afraid of the dark . <eos>
 Sunlight . <eos>
 Plan on carrying some away in a kettle ? <eos>
 Patience lad . <eos>
 Tis a delicate operation lad . Requires a bit of engineering . Next ! <eos>
 Do not get too far ! <eos>
 Hurry up ! <eos>
 Never show mercy ! <eos>
 I could have struck off his head just now ! <eos>
 Sapphire ! <eos>
 He will not escape me . <eos>
 You are on your own . like a true champion . <eos>
 I have not heard a note out of you . <eos>
 Not in the mood I am afraid . <eos>
 Listen to him . Not in the mood . <eos>
 Where s your joy if you cannot sing ? <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 By the pond . She was teasing me . <eos>
 Go on . go on . <eos>
 I will try . <eos>
 Wolf slayer worm sticker . give a cheer for the champion ! <eos>
 No no no . this s different ! <eos>
 These chaps will need a woodpecker to pick their teeth . <eos>
 Gonna make ogre stew ! <eos>
 Three cheers for our champion . <eos>
 Very thrifty . Even got your arrow back . <eos>
 They have fired the moat ! <eos>
 Rise Screwball and into the basket with you . <eos>
 They will do nicely . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 Oh Jack you are a wild man to use me so . <eos>
 If you like . <eos>
 Never . <eos>
 But you did . you did ! <eos>
 I may have said perhaps . <eos>
 Liar ! <eos>
 Or perchance . <eos>
 Oh fie . What about the unicorn ? <eos>
 Unicorn ? <eos>
 A promise s a sacred oath . <eos>
 All right . I will show you something sacred . <eos>
 Stop complaining . <eos>
 A gentleman would offer water . <eos>
 Only were he a fool to boot . See yon viper ? <eos>
 I detest serpents . <eos>
 That viper has envenomed the water . No animal will drink here now . <eos>
 What shall we do ? <eos>
 Be patient . <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 The napkin will keep . I would rather not be alone . <eos>
 Your command s my wish Princess Lili . <eos>
 Shhh ! <eos>
 I am a princess . You have no right to order me about . <eos>
 They rival the angels of paradise . <eos>
 Oh Jack might not I touch one ? It would thrill me so . <eos>
 Are you honest ? <eos>
 Jack ! <eos>
 Not if you be chaste . Tis an awesome test of virginity . <eos>
 I have no fear of failure . Your implications are most unbecoming . <eos>
 To fetch your napkin . <eos>
 I do not know . They have hurt the unicorn . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 My father and the Baron . <eos>
 Damned hunters . It was a trap and you were the bait ! <eos>
 My own father . <eos>
 How bad was the unicorn s wound ? <eos>
 It happened so fast . He was hurt and ran away . <eos>
 He did run ? <eos>
 Oh yes and the mare with him . <eos>
 Its powers are strong . <eos>
 I do not want to be reminded of what happened . <eos>
 Jack . Green Jack you must not flatter me so . <eos>
 Tis the truth . <eos>
 A maid must beware of flattery . Methinks you want to kiss me . <eos>
 There s no happier thought under heaven . <eos>
 Nay Jack I am but wary of your intentions . <eos>
 Let it . Have not you a cozy bower we might hide in ? <eos>
 Tis not fit for a princess . <eos>
 Be it fit for your wife Green Jack ? <eos>
 I have no wife . <eos>
 Then perchance you will me . <eos>
 If wishes were horses even beggars would ride . <eos>
 Do you wish it Jack ? Wish you this our wedding band ? <eos>
 What if I answer yes ? Will my wish come true ? <eos>
 Jack . Forgive me . <eos>
 Only what s right . <eos>
 I was bewitched . it s better this way . <eos>
 They told me you were dead . <eos>
 You have freed me Jack . <eos>
 Sunlight . It destroys him . <eos>
 Sunlight ? <eos>
 That s why he goes masked during the day . <eos>
 So he s hiding in the dark . <eos>
 In the dark . where I join him . <eos>
 Oh no dearest Jack . I meant every word . <eos>
 You are teasing still . <eos>
 And I love you my husband . <eos>
 Ouch ! Something s biting me . <eos>
 Biting you ? <eos>
 Pinching me ! <eos>
 Pinching ? Where ? <eos>
 Everywhere ! Ow ! <eos>
 I can not see a thing . <eos>
 Ow ! Whatever it s it hurts . <eos>
 Grand champion s it ? And what great cause leads you to me ? <eos>
 His feet shall never cross my lips . <eos>
 Come closer then Jack that I might give you proper thanks . <eos>
 Couer de Noir ! A demon if the Devil ever made one . <eos>
 He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot . <eos>
 Come sit beside me sweet boy and I will draw you a map . <eos>
 Nay . Tempting as your invitation be . Tell me one thing more . <eos>
 Ask away sweet man . <eos>
 What became of the princess ? <eos>
 Princess ? I know of no princess . <eos>
 Exceeding fair . <eos>
 As fair as me ? <eos>
 Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky . <eos>
 She s dead ! <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Dead dead dead . <eos>
 I do not believe you . <eos>
 Far as you are concerned she s dead believe it or not . <eos>
 Do not be sad Jack not with me here to give you cheer . <eos>
 Tis not the time to speak of cheer . <eos>
 You will visit again ? <eos>
 As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom . <eos>
 I pray God grants it me . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 No fear of that now . <eos>
 Only that ? <eos>
 And charmed of course . <eos>
 Do I not please you Jack ? <eos>
 In every way . <eos>
 And am I not fair ? <eos>
 Wondrously so . <eos>
 Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth ? <eos>
 That was in jest . <eos>
 Jest with me then . <eos>
 How so ? <eos>
 Tell me I am fair as you did the hag . <eos>
 You are fair as the first new flower of spring . <eos>
 And sweet ? <eos>
 Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind . <eos>
 Pray you be sweet as your words dear Jack . <eos>
 A faerie s love makes anything possible . <eos>
 I am promised to another ! <eos>
 You . you . you mortal you ! <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 You beware Jack ! You and your porridge pot heart ! <eos>
 True north . Straight up that pass through the net . <eos>
 We wait . <eos>
 I think she s about to foal . <eos>
 Watch behind or I will never collect on it ! <eos>
 Small miracles better than no miracles . <eos>
 Up ahead ! <eos>
 Come on Gump let s have a look at this witchcraft . <eos>
 His honor I suppose . seeing he no longer can defend it . <eos>
 Bah ! You faeries have the morals of ferrets . <eos>
 Done like a champion . Can you reach me with the line ? <eos>
 It s done . we will never catch him . <eos>
 No speeches ! What s a little swim after sticking worms and ogres ? <eos>
 I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it . <eos>
 Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy . <eos>
 You are well equipped I would say . Legendary arms . <eos>
 May God protect you . <eos>
 I am sending you back to Hell ! <eos>
 Yes yes . Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all . <eos>

 In a dream . <eos>

 He was there and then he was not ! <eos>
 I thought I might stop by . <eos>
 Since seventh grade . <eos>
 Home after . Will you come in and say hi ? <eos>
 He s here . Check the bathroom . <eos>
 I checked everywhere . He s not there . <eos>

 Mom said I should . <eos>

 Red . <eos>
 I love red ! That s my favorite color ! <eos>
 Here honey ! <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 And why was the alarm on ? <eos>
 Oh . I set it to see if it would work . <eos>

 Oh God we do not want the police ! <eos>
 I could not sleep last night . <eos>
 I am supposed to be mad at you but I am not . <eos>
 Uh . using Josh like that . <eos>
 Has he eaten anything at all ? <eos>
 Who are all these people ? <eos>
 I will survive . <eos>
 He seems lonely . <eos>
 Are you his friend ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage ? <eos>
 I am living here while I build another house . <eos>
 Is that legal ? <eos>
 Nope . <eos>
 Monday . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 I am not shaving my legs or pits this summer I have decided . <eos>
 He s not gay . I found out purely by accident believe me . <eos>
 I mean drugs . I thought you said he was ? <eos>
 I need to ask you something Mr . Nelson . <eos>
 I want you to try something with me okay ? <eos>
 Let s shut up and not kill her . <eos>
 What did you think it would be ? <eos>
 I do not know . More like when I kissed Sam . <eos>
 What are you doing here ? <eos>
 I am supposed to be in Tahoe . <eos>
 Your dad s really gonna build his house ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Well if you do not go I guess I will see you . <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Where s your dad ? <eos>
 He jumped into the ocean . <eos>
 Tell him I said hi . <eos>
 You look better without make up . <eos>
 I can not even take a shower here . <eos>
 I will get your back . <eos>
 No . That s okay . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Your dad dated my mom after her divorce . <eos>
 Really ? <eos>
 I wanted him to marry her . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Turn over . <eos>
 I can use your mom s . <eos>
 I am okay . <eos>
 He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars . <eos>
 He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it . <eos>
 I am coming in . <eos>
 I do not want you to ! <eos>
 We are not gonna do anything . <eos>
 Why are you so stupid ? <eos>
 Why are you so uptight ? <eos>
 Does everything have to have a point ? <eos>
 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 Josh said . <eos>
 I am not gay . <eos>
 You are off you know ? You are way way off . <eos>
 I thought I was helping you . <eos>
 It would help me if I could kiss you . <eos>
 No I do not . NO . I thought we were just friends . <eos>
 Okay . I guess . <eos>
 Are you afraid of heights ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 If he tricked me into loving him s what I meant . <eos>
 You would hate him for the trick . <eos>
 Not if what he left me was real . <eos>
 He asked where you were ! He wants you with him . <eos>
 I do not wanna go . <eos>
 Floating to Catalina . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 He s got a standing invitation . <eos>
 Just I mean well you are here every single day . <eos>
 He s at work while I am here . <eos>
 I guess I would just be jealous if I were him . <eos>
 Well he does not need to worry . <eos>
 Will he talk to me ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 It could have been a squirt gun . <eos>
 You have been good this week . <eos>
 We have known each other since grade school . <eos>
 I have been dreading you . <eos>
 Oh yes . <eos>
 And if I enclosed it ? <eos>
 An exhaust system or a window s code . <eos>
 A sink ? <eos>
 Allowed outside the enclosed area . <eos>
 I flushed it down the toilet . <eos>
 If that s what it takes . <eos>
 Well if it s we have a problem . <eos>
 Months . <eos>
 What are you on ? <eos>
 Pardon me ? <eos>
 how much weight have you lost ? <eos>
 He buys and sells the world . <eos>
 Peter Webber ! Right . Quite the spotlight on that guy . <eos>
 Maybe that s too long . <eos>
 Maybe . <eos>
 That s too long . <eos>
 How old are you ? <eos>
 Forty . <eos>
 We were probably in school together . You went to Berkley ? <eos>
 I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead . <eos>
 I hate this job . <eos>
 What are you talking about ? You love your job . <eos>
 From the day I started . to today . Ca not stand it . <eos>
 For everything . <eos>
 Well I feel better about this now . <eos>
 Good . I was hoping for that . <eos>
 What can I do for you George ? <eos>
 Well it s the least I can do . <eos>
 Yes it is . <eos>
 She s out with a friend . <eos>
 Oh . do you know when she will be home ? <eos>
 She did not really say . <eos>
 Oh . okay . <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 I did not recognize you ! <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>
 Alyssa said you do not even have plumbing over there . <eos>
 Not a shower . <eos>
 I want you both to stay . <eos>
 Thanks I would like that . Thank you . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 You are here early today . <eos>
 We are getting out of the ground today . <eos>
 It s midnight . What s the matter Sam ? <eos>
 He escaped . He s going back in . <eos>
 George this s the third time . <eos>
 The plumber s due out on Friday . <eos>
 You will have to explain that to the police . <eos>
 You were the only neighbor I could tolerate . <eos>
 I did warn you . <eos>
 And you thought they might be under her dress ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Hey it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer . <eos>
 To check up on me ? <eos>
 I will be around to check up on you . <eos>
 Why would you be there ? <eos>
 Because I live there . <eos>
 You live in Cory s parents cabin ? <eos>
 No I am not ! <eos>
 You will know me by the time we are through . <eos>
 I am not going ! <eos>
 I will get your bag . <eos>
 You have everything ? <eos>
 You do not have a choice . <eos>
 Mom . please . <eos>
 I almost saw Catalina . <eos>
 Goodnight . <eos>
 I warned you yesterday . <eos>
 Do not touch me ! You can not touch me ! <eos>
 Get the inkling Sam . I am getting tired of your attitude . <eos>
 No you do not . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 It bugs me . <eos>
 I am gonna take a walk . I need some money . <eos>
 You will have money when you work . <eos>
 You are so predictable . <eos>
 I would blame you . I want you here . <eos>
 I am not doing it ! <eos>
 It will be fine . <eos>
 And I do not take a shower in the middle of the yard . <eos>
 I can promise you complete privacy . <eos>
 Hey . hey ! <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 When are you going to be back ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Well until you know you can not go . <eos>
 Oh okay . <eos>
 A friend of yours s here . <eos>
 Did you got through my pants ? <eos>
 I might have a solution . <eos>
 You are too fucking late . <eos>
 The gloves on the table are for you . <eos>
 You can not make me do a thing . <eos>
 Sit down for a second . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Try it . It feels good . <eos>
 Hi Mom . <eos>
 I know . Why ? <eos>
 I like how it feels not to feel . <eos>
 How do you become something you are not ? <eos>
 What would you like to be ? <eos>
 What I am not . <eos>
 What are you now ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 That s not true . <eos>
 See that s the thing . I am what I say I am . <eos>
 I know parts of who you are . <eos>
 What do you know about me ? <eos>
 I am telling you now . <eos>
 I gave up on you . <eos>
 I would be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up . <eos>
 What would you be doing now ? <eos>
 Getting high I guess . <eos>
 If I asked you to stop would you ? <eos>
 I have not used anything for two days . I am trying . <eos>
 I am proud of you Sam . <eos>
 To hide a black eye . <eos>
 Why would not she leave ? <eos>
 After everything he did to you and your mom ? <eos>
 After everything . <eos>
 That s so weird . <eos>
 What s wrong with your back ? <eos>
 The kind where there s not really an answer . <eos>
 I still do not know what that means . <eos>
 The kind where there s not really an answer . <eos>
 I still do not know what that means . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I would have lied to me if I thought I would believe it . <eos>
 Here . <eos>
 Good for you . <eos>
 I would build a house . <eos>
 You know what mortise and tenon is ? <eos>
 I can die trying . <eos>
 I have not been touched in years . <eos>
 Left you this place . <eos>
 At least your father tried George . <eos>
 I know there s an explanation . <eos>
 God you look like crap George . <eos>
 I want you to find someone for me . <eos>
 I do not let him . He just loves to . <eos>
 Three . <eos>
 Oh . Sorry . <eos>
 It s okay . <eos>
 She needs to be alone I think . <eos>
 Because Dad left ? <eos>
 She s a little sad s all . <eos>
 I do not even care if he ever comes back . <eos>
 Ring the bell before you try the door . <eos>
 You let him pierce his nose ? <eos>
 Where s he ? <eos>
 Where he always is . <eos>
 He does not answer . <eos>
 Why does he have a lock on his door ? <eos>
 You are the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life . <eos>
 I am not talking just physically . Even your anger s perfect . <eos>
 Where have you been for a week ? <eos>
 Four days . I left to think . <eos>
 What did you do with your dog ? <eos>
 Kurt s been feeding him . <eos>
 But you can not call me while you think ? <eos>
 Why would they tow your truck ? <eos>
 I was parked in day parking . <eos>
 Why call me ? <eos>
 I am going to tear down the shack and build my house . <eos>
 Money ? <eos>
 Where will you live ? <eos>
 The garage . <eos>
 Friday . God I hate the thought of him home all day . <eos>
 I will be by Saturday to pick him up . <eos>
 He does not want to spend the weekends with you anymore . <eos>
 Not for the weekend . For the summer . <eos>
 Sounding ? I need help . He s cheap labor . <eos>
 One of you would end up dead . <eos>
 At least we will have a house to show for it . <eos>
 Forget it really . I will survive . <eos>
 I want him with me . <eos>
 No you do not . Trust me . <eos>
 I am married . <eos>
 I drove over and you were gone . <eos>
 I can not leave the house ? <eos>
 Last time you were gone for a week ! <eos>
 Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me ? <eos>
 No . I was going to let you do that . <eos>
 He s not spending the summer in Tahoe . <eos>
 Let s go . <eos>
 Well for later then . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I used to live here . <eos>
 But you hated four out of the five you did . <eos>
 I was here six years . And I only hated two . <eos>
 Which ? <eos>
 The first and the last . <eos>
 Sam s favorite . <eos>
 I am fine . Nothing . I will drop by your lunch tomorrow . <eos>
 I dreamed about your house last night . <eos>
 Finished or unfinished ? <eos>
 It was perfect George . Amazing . It was so real . <eos>
 Did not you once dream you could lick people well though ? <eos>
 That was not a dream . That was Sam . <eos>
 Oh . with his ear infection ! <eos>
 My tongue around the edge of his ear s what cured him . <eos>
 The antibiotics were not working . It s what I believe George . <eos>
 Hindsight . It s like foresight without a future . <eos>
 You are not well . <eos>
 My stupid back . <eos>
 He wo not use my shower . I do not get it . <eos>
 Or wound . Let them keep their eyes and fingers . <eos>
 You are a good mother . <eos>
 I think so . <eos>
 This was my very first slow dance . <eos>
 I smiled at him . <eos>
 Watch out for the smile boys . <eos>
 Oh I am worse . Much much worse . <eos>
 No . Why ? I like to be with Sam . <eos>
 How much time do they get to spend with their dad ? <eos>
 I can hire workers to help me . <eos>
 Going on ? <eos>
 When I picked you up from the train station . what you said . <eos>
 What did I say ? <eos>
 You have never said that before . <eos>
 I can not pick you up . <eos>
 You bit my finger . <eos>
 If I were not married ? <eos>
 I need to know . <eos>
 You need to know what ? Do I still love you ? <eos>
 I did not think you would come today . <eos>
 Peter left me yesterday . <eos>
 Left you ? <eos>
 I will be in the bedroom . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 So could I . <eos>
 It s not my back that s killing me . <eos>
 I am an idiot to have you up there . <eos>
 Not a perfect day . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Does Alyssa know ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 You got any weed ? <eos>
 You got the money ? <eos>
 Do not even . I am there . <eos>
 I was not sure . <eos>
 I could use the money . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 Everything happens for a reason . That s what my dad said . <eos>
 Then you tell me what just happened ? <eos>
 The payoff . <eos>
 A man he respects . <eos>
 Is Lois still here ? I am starved . <eos>
 I will make you something . <eos>
 Should I ? <eos>
 It would worry me . <eos>
 We should take a vacation . <eos>
 Do you remember anything I have said that was not negative ? <eos>
 Sooner than the Fall . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You can not go because of Sam ? <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 What are you doing home ? <eos>
 You live a fabulous life Robin . <eos>
 Despite you . <eos>
 I never asked for more . <eos>
 That s the problem . <eos>
 Please do not leave me . <eos>
 Sam took them to a movie . <eos>
 I will be in the bedroom . <eos>
 That was my plan . to be hardly recognizable to you as me . <eos>
 I feel in love with George again . <eos>
 Are you wearing eye shadow ? <eos>
 Take it off . <eos>
 Either do you . <eos>
 Hey . <eos>
 You got a dog ? <eos>
 It s not ours . It s George s . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I guess I could teach you some things . <eos>
 Okay . <eos>
 I did not go in your room . <eos>
 Depends on what I would give up on . <eos>
 I do not know what I am doing . <eos>
 I would not let Adam or Ryan see you doing it . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 You could keep it and rent it out ? <eos>
 This s what he wants . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 He will be gone for his birthday . <eos>
 What did you say ? <eos>
 Dad said it first . <eos>
 I just thought it would be nice . <eos>
 Not all day . I will be home after lunch . <eos>
 Can we really help build a house ? <eos>
 Someone stop her ! <eos>
 Yes it is . <eos>

 I thought I had to do something . <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 I changed my mind . <eos>
 And now ? <eos>
 Curious . <eos>
 About what ? <eos>
 How a Sandman lives . <eos>
 Not about that . <eos>
 I am listening . <eos>
 I am afraid to tell you . <eos>
 I am not armed . Well ? <eos>
 Why s it wrong to run ? <eos>
 So ? Do what everyone does . Try like hell for renewal . <eos>
 Are you a 5 or a 6 ? <eos>
 Six . I go red next year . <eos>

 You are sure you do not want to try ? <eos>
 But I was not sure you would come . <eos>
 Here I am . Shall I come in ? <eos>
 I am the most beautiful woman you have ever seen I suppose ? <eos>
 Maybe . sure . <eos>
 Thanks . but I have the choice . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Then it s still no . <eos>
 I do not believe you . There has to be more . <eos>
 All right . <eos>
 I am going to run . <eos>
 Why tell me ? <eos>
 You know something . <eos>
 About running dying what ? <eos>
 Both . running s what I am interested in . <eos>
 How can I ? <eos>
 A Runner gave it to me . <eos>
 And then you killed him right ? <eos>
 I let him go . believe me . <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 Speak to your friends for me Jessica . please . <eos>
 Please ? What friends ? <eos>
 I do not have much time . <eos>
 I never heard of a Sandman running . ever . <eos>
 And I never heard of Sanctuary . <eos>
 What do you need ? <eos>
 That s tomorrow . <eos>
 I wish I could help you . <eos>
 Maybe you will think of something . <eos>
 I wish I knew what you think I know . <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 If you trusted me you would know . <eos>
 We are coming to Arcade . Shall we Relive together ? <eos>
 You are not going are you ? <eos>
 That s nice . <eos>
 Maybe they are angry because they are grown in meccano breeders . <eos>
 Insane . Nurseries are better than any mother could be . <eos>

 When did you begin to question Lastday ? <eos>
 But what s this why ? <eos>
 Where ? Sanctuary ? Can you take me there ? <eos>
 Then why do not you leave me go to them explain <eos>
 No . Not that either . <eos>
 I would rather take my chances with them . than with Francis . <eos>
 They wo not listen . <eos>
 You think Sandmen will ? There s no other way for me <eos>
 We will convince them . <eos>
 Why Jessica ? You are still a green . <eos>
 It s the only way . <eos>
 It s brighter there . besides we can not go back . <eos>
 You are really one of us now are not you ? <eos>
 We will be all right . We will . <eos>
 Sooner or later we will have to try something . <eos>
 Why do not we rest here ? We know we can eat these . <eos>
 I doubt it . <eos>
 Do not ever let go . <eos>
 I wo not . <eos>
 Do you think he was telling the Truth ? <eos>
 The Lifeclocks have no power outside . <eos>
 . But I still have the choice . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Then the answer s yes . <eos>
 He had a mother and father and he knew them . <eos>
 One in a million I suppose <eos>
 You want there to be one . that does not . <eos>
 There has to be ! I know it exists ! It has to ! <eos>
 He asked if we would bury him when his time comes . <eos>
 We can not . We are going back . <eos>
 To what ? <eos>

 Whatever our name is . <eos>

 Whatever suggested the idea to you ? <eos>
 I did sir . <eos>
 Yes with all due respect I do Citizen Barras . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 May I come to the map ? <eos>
 No thank you . <eos>
 Things are quite serious I should say . <eos>
 To be perfectly honest I have not the vaguest idea . <eos>
 Are you serious ? <eos>
 I do not even know whether a defense s possible . <eos>
 What forces do you have at your disposal ? <eos>
 About 5000 troops . <eos>
 Cavalry ? <eos>
 The 21st Dragoons about two or three hundred troopers . <eos>
 Any cannon ? <eos>
 There are none here . <eos>
 Where are they ? <eos>
 Well I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons . <eos>
 You could have them here by daybreak . <eos>
 Is this enough to oppose 40000 men ? <eos>
 Properly arranged yes . <eos>
 These are odds of 8 to 1 . <eos>
 Are you proposing to transfer command to me ? <eos>
 You realize what s at stake ? <eos>
 Our lives the revolution my career ? <eos>
 And where s the army ? <eos>
 It s on this road sire following me . <eos>
 And who s defending Paris ? <eos>
 Unhappily it s true sire . <eos>
 I do not know sire . <eos>

 I do not know what has happened to Prince Joseph . <eos>
 Bertrand sire . <eos>
 I have just had the most vivid . dream . about Josephine . <eos>
 Yes sire ? <eos>
 Come back in an hour . <eos>

 Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip ? <eos>
 No sir none at all . <eos>
 You may go Captain Charles . <eos>

 Why are you carrying the dog ? <eos>
 His paws are frozen and he cannot walk . <eos>
 When you eat him may I have some ? <eos>
 Four o clock . <eos>
 My God what a fire ! <eos>
 The first reports came in at about ten . <eos>
 Why did not you wake me then ? <eos>
 At first it hardly seemed more than a routine fire . <eos>
 How did it spread so quickly ? <eos>
 It s the work of incendiaries . <eos>
 I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting . <eos>
 Oh ? <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Good morning sir . Are you General Bonaparte ? <eos>
 I am Citizen . Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais ? <eos>
 Yes sir . Are you acquainted with her ? <eos>
 I have met her . What s your business with me ? <eos>

 Does your mother know you have come ? <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 Well then you have a lot of initiative my young friend . <eos>
 Yes an excellent idea . <eos>
 I very much doubt that he will . <eos>
 Oh . <eos>
 I am afraid I am just a bit . <eos>
 Would you like some brandy ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 I will have the fire built up . <eos>
 Francis may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear ? <eos>
 Good evening Mademoiselle . <eos>

 Lisette La Croix . <eos>
 That s a very nice name . Where are you from ? <eos>
 Please sir come into bed or I shall die of a chill . <eos>
 Oh yes . of course . <eos>
 Junot ? <eos>
 Not even the slightest hint of something ? <eos>
 You must not act impetuously . <eos>
 It s time to clarify the situation . Everything s over between us . <eos>
 Are you trying to insult me ? <eos>
 Of course not but such violence of feeling makes me wonder . <eos>
 Well you shall see . <eos>
 When s she supposed to return ? <eos>
 Only as a last resort . What are the Councils doing now ? <eos>
 And you seem in excellent health Your Highness . <eos>
 Yes we introduced ourselves at the door . <eos>
 May I offer you a drink ? <eos>
 Oh I do not want to put you to any inconvenience . <eos>
 I thought I was . I was confused . <eos>
 And now ? <eos>
 Now I know that I shall die if you leave me . <eos>
 Do you expect me to believe that ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 But you have had mistresses while you were away . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Were you in love with any of them ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Were they pretty ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Were any of them prettier than I am ? <eos>
 One had better legs . <eos>

 I cannot promise you that . <eos>
 Promise me . <eos>
 I will never forgive you . <eos>
 I do not care but promise you will never leave me . <eos>
 I do not understand you . <eos>
 Promise . <eos>
 Promises mean nothing . <eos>
 Perhaps but tell me you promise anyway . <eos>
 All right I promise . <eos>

 Yes . <eos>
 That s perfect ! <eos>
 Thank you Louis . <eos>
 Let s be honest . Have we anything like it in Russia ? <eos>
 Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money ? <eos>
 I give you my word ! They were confiscated legally ! <eos>
 Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case . <eos>
 What s it my boy ? <eos>
 Oh Leon you are so good . <eos>
 How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like ? <eos>
 While you eat you look at the view . <eos>
 It s a real Paris reunion . <eos>
 Thank you for a wonderful dinner . <eos>
 My name s Count d Algout . I telephoned . <eos>
 If you want to see us you must come later . <eos>
 I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier . <eos>

 I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff . <eos>
 Comrade . <eos>
 Comrade Kopalski . <eos>
 Comrade . <eos>
 What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade . <eos>
 Two thousand francs . <eos>
 A week ? <eos>
 A day . <eos>
 Do you know how much a cow costs Comrade Iranoff ? <eos>
 A cow ? <eos>
 Too bad we have to waste all that time . <eos>
 Look for yourselves . <eos>
 Now please Ninotchka do not start figuring it out in cows . <eos>
 You mean you are deserting Russia ? <eos>
 Just looking around . <eos>
 Monsieur . <eos>
 Oh yes but have you a safe here big enough to hold this ? <eos>
 But gentlemen I am afraid . <eos>
 Right away . instantly ! <eos>
 We can not . but you are so ingenious Leon . <eos>
 Why ? Why should you carry other people s bags ? <eos>
 No thank you . <eos>
 It s a hat Comrade a woman s hat . <eos>
 No not a thing . Would you like to go out ? <eos>
 Well we are back home . <eos>
 Even the swallows are back . <eos>
 That s two weeks from Thursday . <eos>
 We did our utmost to have it set ahead . <eos>
 Well there s nothing we can do about it . Why get excited ? <eos>
 I am sorry sir but I must insist . <eos>
 Do not hold that against me . please ! <eos>
 Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia ? <eos>
 Business . <eos>
 What business ? <eos>
 Private . <eos>
 Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government the White Russians ? <eos>
 Yes ! <eos>
 No visa . <eos>
 I must get into that country of yours ! <eos>
 Oh no . No visa . <eos>
 On what ? <eos>
 How do I know you do not want to blow up a factory ? <eos>
 What for . why ? <eos>
 Or a tunnel or a bridge . <eos>
 Me ? <eos>
 Yes . Could you give me some information ? <eos>
 Gladly . <eos>
 How long do we have to wait here ? <eos>
 Well until the policeman whistles again . <eos>
 At what intervals does he whistle ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 How many minutes between the first and second whistle ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 You are welcome . <eos>
 You might hold this for me . <eos>
 Love to . <eos>
 Bad manners to point with your own . Here . the Eiffel Tower . <eos>
 And where are we ? <eos>
 Suppress it . <eos>
 I will try . <eos>
 Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence . <eos>
 Yes very strange . <eos>
 I am glad I saw it before becoming extinct . <eos>
 Please do not misunderstand me . <eos>
 Then you do not want me to go there . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He looks sad . Do you whip him ? <eos>
 No though the mere thought makes my mouth water . <eos>
 Thank you . I have had all the calories necessary for today . <eos>
 Thank you . Thank you . <eos>
 That s why I believe in the future of my country . <eos>
 Ni notchka . <eos>
 That s correct . <eos>
 Ninotchka do you like me just a little bit ? <eos>
 Your general appearance s not distasteful . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all . <eos>
 What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you ? <eos>
 I would like to say it a thousand times . <eos>
 Do not do it please . <eos>
 I was wounded before Warsaw . <eos>
 Wounded ? How ? <eos>
 A Polish lancer . I was sixteen . <eos>
 Poor Ninotchka . Poor poor Ninotchka . <eos>
 It s twelve o clock . <eos>
 It s false sentimentality . <eos>
 No that was restful . Again . <eos>
 Oh my barbaric Ninotchka . My impossible unromantic statistical . <eos>
 The telephone s ringing . <eos>
 Oh let it ring . <eos>
 Ninotchka or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova . <eos>
 Let s forget that we ever met . <eos>
 Tonight let s not represent anybody but ourselves . <eos>
 It s out of the question . If you wish to approach me . <eos>
 You know I want to . <eos>
 Then do it through my lawyer ! <eos>
 I kissed the Polish lancer too . before he died . <eos>
 I did not follow you . <eos>
 Then how did you get here ? <eos>
 I always eat here . <eos>
 This s a place for workmen . <eos>
 What are you after ? <eos>
 Must one always be after something ? <eos>
 Your tactics are useless . My name s neither Buljanoff Iranoff nor Kopalski . <eos>
 Will you smile ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Just smile . <eos>
 At what ? <eos>
 Because we are an odd couple . <eos>
 Then you should go back to your table . <eos>
 Do you like Scotch stories ? <eos>
 I have never heard one . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 For twelve francs seventy five . <eos>
 Not radio . Let s have music that s just for ourselves . <eos>
 Anything Ninotchka . <eos>
 Did you make any change in this room ? <eos>
 I do not think so . <eos>
 And General Savitzky . <eos>
 A funny story ? <eos>
 You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names . <eos>
 You must darling . <eos>
 To the loveliest story I ever heard . <eos>
 You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast . <eos>
 Oh everything s so wonderful ! It s getting farther and farther away ! <eos>
 What darling ? <eos>
 Thursday . <eos>
 Yes . Do not worry . Everything will be all right . <eos>
 Darling darling . please ! <eos>
 I must talk to my brothers ! <eos>

 And I adore you Ninotchua . <eos>
 No . Nobody will find us . <eos>
 Yes . a little white house . <eos>
 Not white darling . <eos>

 Our salute will be a kiss . <eos>
 Yes . a kiss . salute ! <eos>

 Let s turn on the radio . <eos>
 Radio ! What s radio ? <eos>
 Well then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven . <eos>
 No no music . <eos>

 Who cried that one ? <eos>
 It s their wish . <eos>
 So happy and so tired . <eos>
 So you are behind all this . I should have known . <eos>
 Good morning Swana . <eos>
 Did you win ? <eos>
 You would be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots . <eos>
 What a gruesome proof of the power of the press ! <eos>
 First tell me are you my little Volga boatman ? <eos>
 Yes I am your little Volga boatman . <eos>
 Too bad ! Brings our price down ten thousand francs ! <eos>
 Oh yes . <eos>
 Rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news ! <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 Is anything wrong ? Are you ill ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Do not tell me the bed has lost its best friend . <eos>
 That bad ? Old or young ? <eos>
 Is this your new dress suit ? <eos>
 Yes Swana . <eos>
 Did not I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you ? <eos>
 Yes Swana you did . <eos>
 Am I interrupting ? <eos>
 Not at all . Your Highness may I present Madame Yakushova ? <eos>
 How do you do ? <eos>
 No thanks Swana . <eos>
 Did I act stupidly last night ? Should I apologize ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 All right I will listen . <eos>
 I am afraid that s what it is . <eos>
 She s gone Leon . <eos>
 Do you expect me to believe that ? <eos>
 Hello . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I must ask you to leave . <eos>
 Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow . <eos>
 In that case I can only say good by . <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 May I have your bags madame ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 That s no business . that s a social injustice . <eos>
 That depends on the tip . <eos>
 Yes it does . <eos>
 You mean you have finished the whole investigation ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Please . sit down . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Well Comrade have you heard from your friends Kopalski Buljanoff and Iranoff ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Yes . leaving immediately . <eos>
 Oh madame ! This s a restaurant not a meadow . <eos>
 Can you recommend a restaurant ? <eos>
 At P re Mathieu s . <eos>
 Where s that ? <eos>
 It s just a place for workmen . <eos>
 Where s it ? <eos>
 Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel . <eos>
 How do you do my friend . <eos>
 Your Highness forgive this intrusion but . <eos>
 What s it Rakonin ? Did you lose your job ? <eos>
 No madame something of the utmost importance . it concerns your jewels . <eos>
 My jewels ? <eos>
 They are here ! Your jewels ! Here in Paris ! <eos>
 Alexis ! Do you know what you are saying ? <eos>
 Then tell Richardson to fire him . <eos>
 Never . I never said that about Jews ! <eos>
 Uh he s rushing back from his tennis game sir . <eos>
 So . let s go . <eos>
 He told me to take you to his conference room . <eos>
 That s Helms . He s sang froid a world class poker player . <eos>
 Yeah ? Well I own the fucking casino . <eos>
 Son of a bitch . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here . <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 Nobody knows more about this thing than you do John . <eos>
 Yes . I got the money . <eos>
 The President would like to know if that was the last payment . <eos>
 I will bet he would . <eos>
 Is it ? <eos>
 You do it . <eos>
 Why me ? <eos>
 How so ? <eos>
 You think this s just about politics ? <eos>
 I figured that out . <eos>
 I think he means the Kennedy assassination . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 He left his White House phone number in his hotel room . <eos>
 Is it legal ? I mean has anyone ever done it before ? <eos>
 In hiding . He sent Liddy to talk to me . <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 He wants money . <eos>
 Pay him . <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 I thought the gloves were off . <eos>
 Forget it . Ehrenberg s paid three times that much . <eos>
 . go on . <eos>
 I trusted Mitchell . It was that damn big mouth wife of his . <eos>
 At least Mitchell stood up to it . <eos>
 There s no secrets here Al . <eos>
 Night Al . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 Cox ! Fire him . <eos>
 But he works for the Attorney General . Only Richardson can fire him . <eos>
 Your lawyers feel it s the . smoking gun . <eos>
 Can we get around this Al ? <eos>
 It s the Supreme Court sir you do not get around it . <eos>
 Lincoln used it . <eos>
 That was civil war . <eos>
 How do you see this ? <eos>
 Sir you talked about opening up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 It came over from Vietnam you know . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 That fruitcake ! What about him ? <eos>
 I did ? <eos>
 We were working on China . <eos>
 Our own intelligence capability to fix the leaks ? <eos>
 Silence ! <eos>
 Yes sir but . do you think Gray will go for it ? <eos>
 It s got nothing to do with justice . It s national security . <eos>
 How s this national security ? <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Before ? Eisenhower approved that ? <eos>
 You never told him ? <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 These kids are being manipulated by the Communists . Like Chambers and Hiss . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Do not let it lose us the right wing vote . <eos>
 . but even the presidency s not enough anymore . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 The presidency wo not protect us Bob . We are beyond politics now . <eos>
 Right . They do not trust ! They do not trust America ! <eos>
 We could leverage Helms . <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 When I met with him he said . <eos>
 Put Townsend in Belgium it s available . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why me ? <eos>
 Harold may have lost touch with his Bible but thou must never lapse . <eos>
 Is it my turn ? <eos>
 Thou must . <eos>
 What . ? <eos>
 Harold . can I get you anything ? <eos>
 And so shall I . Arrange some coffee would you General Cushman ? <eos>
 Not if I give you all the cards . <eos>
 The President would support a reasonable request for an increase . <eos>
 Mr . Castro . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos . <eos>
 Well we will lodge a formal protest . <eos>
 Cuba would be a small price to pay . <eos>
 So President Kennedy thought . <eos>
 Edgar think twice . He works in the kitchen . <eos>
 Winning ? <eos>
 Actually I have just had a bit of luck . <eos>
 How about you ? Are you going to win ? <eos>
 You should ask Bobby . <eos>
 Yes . Your old friend from Cuba . <eos>
 I never met the man . <eos>
 We took his system out . <eos>
 Injections . Even this noble sport s been fixed . Seen the guys ? <eos>
 They are around . <eos>
 The White House . <eos>
 You are fucking me . <eos>
 We are gonna be plumbers Frank . We are gonna plug a leak . <eos>
 Who we working for ? <eos>
 I wo not tell him if you wo not . <eos>
 We will see about that . <eos>
 Her name s Sandy . <eos>
 Exactly yes Mr . President . That s my contention . <eos>
 We have to entertain the possibility . <eos>
 But it must be done your government s paralyzed . <eos>
 Idiotic ? Yes I suppose it was . <eos>
 Do you ever pray ? You know . believe in a Supreme Being ? <eos>
 Uh . not really . You mean on my knees ? <eos>
 Not at all . This s not going to leak s it ? <eos>
 But your writings have changed the world Mr . Chairman . <eos>
 How a fat man gets so many girls . <eos>
 Just . uh . you know . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Yes Mr . President . <eos>
 We let you down did not we . Your people . <eos>
 That was Mr . Kennedy . <eos>
 You do not think he was a hero ? <eos>
 Did you cry when he died ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I do not know . He made me see the stars . <eos>
 Looks can be deceiving . <eos>
 We know you have taken a great risk in inviting us here . <eos>
 I was the lesser of two evils . <eos>
 I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker . <eos>
 Free if you are the president . <eos>
 You need her Dick in 60 she was worth five six million votes . <eos>
 Do not worry I will use the old Nixon charm on her . <eos>
 Four . Two boys . Two girls . And eight wounded . <eos>

 That would be nice too . <eos>
 I expect to try . <eos>
 Pride will do . <eos>
 No he takes after his mother . <eos>
 You got me beat on both accounts . <eos>
 The hell I do . <eos>
 He s not making light . <eos>
 He s my father . <eos>
 Oh right . Baking powder we need baking powder . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 As do you . <eos>
 Our governor s a bigger fool than I thought . <eos>
 You could not have known . <eos>
 I said I am not my sister . <eos>
 I know that . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 Of course I do . <eos>
 Very well then . <eos>
 Goodbye . <eos>
 Lovely . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 What unit ? <eos>
 First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton . <eos>
 Who cared for your wounds ? <eos>
 With a lace table cloth ? <eos>
 Please forgive me for keeping you waiting . <eos>
 Apology accepted . <eos>
 Thank you Colonel . I am afraid I do not know your name . <eos>
 Colonel will do . <eos>
 As you wish . <eos>
 Oh ? <eos>
 I served in His Majesty s army in the French and Indian War . <eos>
 Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner . <eos>
 That s a separate issue . <eos>
 I consider them linked . <eos>
 Prisoner exchange . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 You have eighteen of my men . I want them back . <eos>
 Sir . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 Are you going to meet with him ? <eos>
 Most certainly . Arrange it . <eos>
 Perhaps . <eos>
 And if I triumph you triumph . <eos>
 Probably . <eos>
 How can we end this madness ? <eos>
 Difficult sir . This s as you pointed out a civil war . <eos>
 I understand sir . <eos>
 Unless I am dreaming I think I see irregulars at their center . <eos>
 Thank you . How s the spotted one s milk ? <eos>
 The middle colonies ? <eos>
 Poor Richard says they will make a Declaration of Independence by July . <eos>
 Yes . He seeks a levy of troops and money . <eos>
 And the Governor ? <eos>
 When I have children I hope I do not hide behind them . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Not yet . What happened ? <eos>
 You are in no condition to ride . <eos>
 I have no choice I . <eos>
 It s already over . <eos>
 It s safer if we stay together . <eos>
 Yes sir . My father taught me . <eos>
 He tried . It did not take . <eos>
 Yes . . father . <eos>
 You know how old I am . <eos>
 God help us all when you are forty . <eos>
 I did not see any . <eos>
 And the dogs too I will wager . <eos>
 Father ? <eos>
 Pride s his weakness . <eos>
 I should have killed him when I had the chance ? <eos>
 Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause . <eos>
 You learned her lessons better than I . <eos>
 She got me at a more impressionable age . <eos>
 Full sentences . As if she had been speaking all along . <eos>
 I do not believe it . and I was not there for it . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Come with me . I will tell you when we get there . <eos>
 Granted . Where are you going ? <eos>
 Cheraw Falls . <eos>
 Seven homes along the Black River so far . <eos>
 Is it her ? Is Anne in there ? <eos>
 She is . Do not go in there . <eos>
 You know what happened . <eos>
 No I do not . <eos>
 And what do they know ? <eos>
 That s not enough . Tell me . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He left us . <eos>
 I do not care . I hate him . <eos>
 You do not hate him . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 Nonetheless I would like to know Mister Marion how . how . how . <eos>
 It s Mister Marion . <eos>
 I understood him to be a Patriot as well . <eos>
 Thirteen years . <eos>
 That s a damn long time . <eos>
 I was an American I just did not know it yet . <eos>
 Balderdash ! <eos>
 There are a thousand avenues other than war at our disposal . <eos>
 Name five hundred . <eos>
 Royal petition delegates to court judicial redress economic boycott bribery . <eos>
 That s five keep going . <eos>
 . time royal succession regicide bribery . <eos>
 You said bribery twice . <eos>
 I am a parent I do not have the luxury of principles . <eos>
 Gabriel . <eos>
 I will see to it that he serves under me . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 I am sorry I was not here for this . <eos>
 There s nothing you could have done Gates s a damned fool . <eos>
 We saw . <eos>
 I am I think . <eos>
 What are my orders ? <eos>
 Fall six months at the earliest . <eos>
 Long time . <eos>
 Not held just slowed down . <eos>
 How many men does Cornwallis have under his command ? <eos>
 I am sorry I did not know . <eos>
 How many men have we seen die ? <eos>
 Two . Gabriel and Thomas . <eos>
 Goodbye Harry . <eos>
 Thank you . Maybe all of this will buy him some peace . <eos>
 I hope so . <eos>
 Robert . Robert E . Lee . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 You may of course keep your weapons but I must warn you that . <eos>
 I am familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley . <eos>
 Yes quite but you should know that . <eos>
 That will be all Major . I will wait for Lord Cornwallis . <eos>
 Yes . you will wait . <eos>
 Four five miles . <eos>
 Leave him . Take care of William and Susan . <eos>
 I heard about your son . I am sorry . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 For trying to impose some decency on that sort . <eos>
 Do not depend on my decency . I am one of that sort . <eos>
 About a hundred and twenty . Less than a third . <eos>
 Yes he does . <eos>
 Earned . <eos>
 I lost another a year ago Thomas . He was only fifteen . <eos>
 Remember Braddock ? <eos>
 That bad ? <eos>
 Worse . <eos>
 Proud priggish and competent . A very bad combination in an adversary . <eos>
 When ? <eos>
 But father they might come this way . <eos>
 Put them away . <eos>
 Thank you . Did you finish the upper field ? <eos>
 Six pounders . Lots of them . <eos>
 Quiet . <eos>
 Do not blame yourself you did what I told you to do . <eos>
 I am glad I killed them . I am glad . <eos>
 You will see soon enough hon . <eos>
 Ayuh . <eos>
 It s a place where the dead speak Missy . <eos>
 Is that right dad ? <eos>
 Am I really gonna have my own room ? <eos>
 Yaay ! <eos>
 But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary ? <eos>
 In a minute hon . Let Gage finish his turn . <eos>
 Ellie . Ellie . what . <eos>
 Who s this Paxcow ? Is he like the boogeyman ? <eos>
 He s a ghost . But he s a good ghost . <eos>
 Of course I will . <eos>
 I will . Come and kiss me . <eos>
 Yaay ! <eos>
 Yayyy ! <eos>
 Well I thought it was safe <eos>
 For a little while . <eos>
 To remember . <eos>
 Missy Dandridge . And she says it s a operation ! <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Because you promised . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 I hate that smell . <eos>
 No more chocolate chip cookies . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 Daddy do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven ? <eos>
 I wo not . is Missy in heaven do you think ? <eos>
 Oh faith s a little more than just believing . <eos>
 I am sure you are not . <eos>
 Then why do I have to go to bed ? <eos>
 Because your mother and I need the rest sugar . Now buzz . <eos>
 Come with us daddy . Please come with us ! <eos>
 I swear . <eos>
 I am Rachel . Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy here . <eos>
 Not at all . <eos>
 Good for you . <eos>
 Allman Brothers . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 Aw you will be okay . Less than a mile . <eos>
 I am sorry . At least it do not look like he suffered . <eos>
 Ellie will though . She will suffer plenty . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Seems like you told me about a promise you made <eos>
 Does she love the cat ? <eos>
 Yes but <eos>
 Then come on . <eos>
 The place we are going s on the other side of that . <eos>
 Give me the cat . I will take care of it myself . <eos>
 You will see before long . Let s go . <eos>
 Is there quicksand ? <eos>
 Ayuh . <eos>
 You are telling me . <eos>
 You keep saying that . <eos>
 This time I mean it . <eos>
 Whose burying ground ? <eos>
 The Micmac Indians . I brought you here to bury Ellen s cat . <eos>
 Why ? For God s sake why ? <eos>
 I had my reasons Louis . We will talk later . All right ? <eos>
 I guess so . but . <eos>
 You want to rest a bit before you start ? <eos>
 Your cairn . <eos>
 Do not worry about that . <eos>
 Jud why am I doing all this ? <eos>
 Because it s right . <eos>
 I guess it would not hurt . <eos>
 Why then things should be fine . <eos>
 Well . a touch of the flu . <eos>
 This babe has said enough . <eos>
 It s Ellie s cat . <eos>
 Nope . He s your cat now . <eos>
 I am thinking about going to bed . <eos>
 Shit ! Look at this mess ! <eos>
 Ayuh it s a mess all right . <eos>
 And because the dead walked . <eos>
 Remember . <eos>
 You do not understand <eos>
 Louis the house s beautiful . <eos>
 Come on let s parole em . <eos>
 Jesus the road ! <eos>
 Yes thanks . I am Louis Creed . <eos>
 Yes I know . This path Louis ? Where does it go ? <eos>
 It s beautiful ! <eos>
 Extraordinarily morbid maybe . <eos>
 She was a little over excited that s all . Poor kid . <eos>
 I just said <eos>
 I know what you just said . Ellie clear your place . <eos>
 Do not shilly shally Louis . Give the little girl her promise . <eos>
 I got eggs down here ! <eos>
 Good d <eos>
 You are doing fine . <eos>
 Oh Louis I just do not know about this <eos>
 I am sure . <eos>
 AnaMaria ! Have you seen Gibbs ? I need to put together <eos>
 Safe ! At Port Royal . With the Royal Navy . <eos>
 That boat s my livelihood ! <eos>
 You will get it back . Or one better . <eos>
 I will . <eos>
 Aye aye sir ! <eos>
 She . Goes . Free . <eos>
 You have got one shot and we can not die . <eos>
 You can not . I can . <eos>
 Elizabeth goes free ! <eos>
 We got that part . Anything else ? <eos>
 Say the name or I slit your throat . <eos>
 No you wo not . <eos>
 I am supposed to . trust you ? <eos>
 You left me on a desert island what worse can you do ? <eos>
 Wait as long as you like . <eos>
 You can go to your grave not knowing . <eos>
 That s fair . <eos>
 All right then . <eos>
 That so ? <eos>
 Men ! Are you up for it ? <eos>
 Aye for us there is . <eos>
 Now . No do not kill him . <eos>
 No . But him I believe . He us genuinely angry . <eos>
 Very well . <eos>
 Elizabeth Turner . I am a maid in the governor s household . <eos>
 Thank you sir . <eos>
 Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner ? <eos>
 Now none of that . Please dig in . <eos>
 Then why are not you eating ? <eos>
 Would that I could . <eos>
 It s a pirate medallion . <eos>
 It s a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta . <eos>
 Will you can not trust him . <eos>
 Boy overboard ! <eos>
 Fetch a hook haul him out of there ! <eos>
 His name s Will Turner that s all I found out . <eos>
 Very good . <eos>
 I am a bit nervous myself <eos>
 You are speaking up for him again ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I know where your heart truly lies . <eos>
 That would hardly be proper . <eos>
 Yes yes . <eos>
 Ceremony ? <eos>
 Captain Norrington s promotion ceremony . <eos>
 I am told that dress s the very latest fashion in London . <eos>
 Women in London must have learned to not breathe . <eos>
 About the day we met . Do you remember ? <eos>
 Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request . <eos>
 Will how many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth ? <eos>
 At least once more Miss Swann . As always . <eos>
 Truthfully you were a bit late . <eos>
 then we never would have met . <eos>
 I guess you can never truly know someone else s heart . <eos>
 It does not ! <eos>
 but that was not a proper kiss . <eos>
 Miss Swann if you will be so kind ? <eos>
 I saved your life now you have saved mine . We are square . <eos>
 Me ! <eos>
 You are in league with Barbossa ! <eos>
 No I am rescuing you . <eos>
 The trees are taller . <eos>
 Do not be thinking I am not already working on it . <eos>
 What ? What was that ? Something funny Miss Swann ? Share please . <eos>
 More to drink ! <eos>
 To the Black Pearl . <eos>
 Nor did you I noticed . <eos>
 He might delay the rescue . and that would be too late . <eos>
 Exactly . <eos>
 These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed . <eos>
 Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants . Something he needs . <eos>
 And you have got that have you ? <eos>
 That he is . <eos>
 She can hold a bit longer . <eos>
 We are catching up ! <eos>
 Ah that s a dark and unpleasant tale best left untold . <eos>
 I know . That was for the smell . <eos>
 That we are . <eos>
 Will it will go worse for us for Elizabeth especially if we fight . <eos>
 Wait for my order what the blazes s that ? <eos>
 I do not think that will be necessary . <eos>
 Sorry I did not know . <eos>
 Smith . <eos>
 Captain Jack Sparrow . If you please . <eos>
 Indeed . <eos>
 We are bound for Port Royal not Isla de Muerta . <eos>
 They left me stranded . Twice . What have you got to lose ? <eos>
 Nothing I would not be please to be rid of . <eos>
 I knew you would listen to reason ! <eos>
 I have made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates . <eos>
 You threatened Miss Swann . <eos>
 Only a little . <eos>
 Pirate . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Move ! <eos>
 No . I can not just step aside and let you escape . <eos>
 Somewhat . <eos>
 Where does it make berth ? <eos>
 Because you are a pirate . <eos>
 And you want to turn pirate yourself ? <eos>
 Never . They took Miss Swann . <eos>
 How ? The key s run off . <eos>
 Agreed ! <eos>
 We need to go ! <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 Commandeer . We are going to commandeer a ship . Nautical term . <eos>
 It s still against the law . <eos>
 Remarkable how often those two traits coincide . <eos>
 Aye ! Avast ! <eos>
 My father . William Turner ? <eos>
 I swear you look just like him . <eos>
 It s not true my father was a pirate . <eos>
 Figured you would not want to hear it . <eos>
 Sure because he could always go pirating . <eos>
 My father was not a pirate ! <eos>
 Oh did I forget to mention that ? <eos>
 Do not worry . I have already got a Quartermaster there ! <eos>
 Depends . <eos>
 On what ? <eos>
 I will lead them away . <eos>
 Jack ! <eos>
 Do not talk . These caves magnify sound . Just follow me . <eos>
 It s the right way . <eos>
 The Black Pearl s a real ship . <eos>
 No it s not . <eos>
 Yes it is . I have seen it . <eos>
 You have seen it ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You have seen the Black Pearl ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You have not seen it . <eos>
 Yes I have . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 But I have seen a ship with black sails . <eos>
 Like I said there s no real ship as can match Hey ! <eos>
 And no lies ! <eos>
 He s not telling the truth . <eos>
 He may be . <eos>
 If he were telling truth he would not have told us . <eos>
 Mentioned it s more what he did . <eos>
 Still <eos>
 Where did he come from ? <eos>
 An explosion in the powder magazine . Merchant vessels run heavily armed . <eos>
 No . She has not . <eos>
 Well she had a very taxing day . Ghastly weather tonight . <eos>
 Bleak . Very bleak . <eos>
 A moment . <eos>
 But <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 Dammit man it appears someone s stealing your ship ! <eos>
 Until he s done . <eos>
 Dr . Bright has escaped . <eos>
 Dr . Argon I demand an explanation . <eos>
 Come with me Susan . I want to show you something . <eos>
 No thank you . <eos>
 Do ? Well I suppose that depends on you . <eos>
 Maybe you should but you can not . <eos>
 Ai not it . <eos>
 You mean besides kicking your ass ? <eos>
 You think you can use me to stop the meltdown . <eos>
 You are not rotting meat . <eos>
 She says it s not . <eos>
 She s lying . She lost the first one on purpose . <eos>
 She did not . The mouse ran down the drain . <eos>
 She let it escape because she wants me to die . <eos>
 Who cares ! We have got to find him ! Hurry ! <eos>
 Eventually . These things are always a matter of leverage . <eos>
 And you think O Brien s that leverage ? <eos>
 That remains to be seen . <eos>
 Based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable . <eos>
 Do you think she loves him ? <eos>
 No Icky this s real . <eos>
 Icarus please ! This s important ! <eos>
 Then you still love me ? <eos>
 Poppy please just tell me what you want . <eos>
 I promise my dear I will give the matter some consideration . <eos>
 Consideration ? <eos>
 If you honestly trust me then you will have to trust me . <eos>
 I am so excited Icarus . <eos>
 Considering what ? <eos>
 What I asked you earlier ? <eos>
 If you loved me like I loved you ? <eos>
 Poppy this s not the time ! <eos>
 Did I ? I have been waiting for that for years . <eos>
 Not that . <eos>
 Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control . <eos>
 That might work . <eos>
 Dr . Nebbleman take care of them . <eos>
 The trunk . <eos>
 Excellent . How long until the assembler tank s complete ? <eos>
 Thank you sir . <eos>
 Donated to science . Perfect . <eos>
 You do not want this . <eos>
 Yeah I do ! <eos>
 You have no idea what this s doing to your body . <eos>
 I like Trix ! <eos>
 I will do whatever I have to do . <eos>
 Aaabout . <eos>
 Yeah . I knew him when I was still in school . <eos>
 What did he want ? <eos>
 That s the guy ? <eos>
 They will in validate the key . Probably nothing . <eos>
 Well you got another problem . <eos>
 The replicators ? <eos>
 You are looking for a urine sample . <eos>
 Susan Dr . Argon s giving you an opportunity here . <eos>
 Opportunity ? <eos>
 No ! Well not those exact words . <eos>
 Nigel can not you see he s using you ? <eos>
 Who s not ? <eos>
 It s Sim . We are almost there . <eos>
 Smell ? Uh something like methylcyanoacrylate . <eos>
 Like Crazy Glue ? <eos>
 So I guess it worked . <eos>
 Wellie well Dr . Bright . You are just in time . <eos>
 What ? No kiss ? Not even for old times sake ? <eos>
 Been out for six months now . <eos>
 Really ? What have you been doing ? <eos>
 You know this and that . <eos>
 Same old Daniel . <eos>
 The big house . <eos>
 I remember you said nanotechnology was going to change the world . <eos>
 It already is . <eos>
 I have read they are using it to repair cancer cells . <eos>
 And for cleaning up oil spills . <eos>
 Right . You predicted it . <eos>
 That s what I thought . <eos>
 We will see ? What does that mean ? <eos>
 Susan this s the future of America here . <eos>
 Daniel what are you doing here ? <eos>
 Please Susan ! I need help ! Something s wrong with me ! <eos>
 Sorry Daniel I am a physicist not a psychiatrist . <eos>
 No something s really wrong . look ! <eos>
 The nanobot . <eos>
 Mouse ? What mouse ? <eos>
 My first organic polymerization was a lab mouse . <eos>
 What happened to it ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment . <eos>
 Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure . <eos>
 I am a plastic man ! A plastic man ! <eos>
 We do not ? <eos>
 Mostly caffeine diuretics . Help you go to the bathroom . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 The nanobot s the only thing that can stabilize the waste . <eos>
 What waste ? <eos>
 The problem s the by product created by the process . <eos>
 The waste . <eos>
 What happens ? <eos>
 Three days ago it was . <eos>
 What do these replicators do to people ? <eos>
 With enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Is not it already too late then ? <eos>
 No no I just feel wired ! <eos>
 What ? What s wrong ? <eos>
 What about it ! <eos>
 Just giving credit where credit s due . <eos>
 You have no one to blame but yourself . <eos>
 Blame the victim . <eos>
 I do not consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress ! <eos>
 Come on I do not see you living in a cave ! <eos>
 And I do not see you sunbathing at Chernobyl ! <eos>
 Yeah . Old times . <eos>
 I am glad you came to me for help . <eos>
 Probably the caffeine . <eos>
 Do you have something to bring me down ? <eos>
 No problem . <eos>
 Daniel I did not hear you come down . <eos>
 The nanobot . it s not here . <eos>
 It s still inside me ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Something else I want to try . <eos>
 I was hoping you were over that . Remember to keep drinking fluids . <eos>
 Getting used to it . <eos>
 Like a glove . <eos>
 On the counter . <eos>
 The head shrinker at the prison . <eos>
 You did not think I could just leave you ? <eos>
 Argon s private lab . <eos>
 Let s go . <eos>
 I am not leaving without you Susan ! <eos>
 Did you think I could just leave you . <eos>
 Oh shit the meltdown . It s spread to the tower . <eos>
 We have got to get the nanobot . <eos>
 It s too late . Argon injected it . <eos>
 You mean he s polymerized like me ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What would happen if I threw him into the core ? <eos>
 The same thing I suppose . <eos>
 I have to ! <eos>
 God what a fight that was . <eos>
 We were different people then . <eos>
 I guess they do . <eos>
 Oh yes you are ! <eos>
 Forget it pissboy ! You tell Argon he can call my lawyer . <eos>
 Yeah I have something I have been meaning to give you . <eos>
 Yeah and what might that be ? <eos>
 An ass beating . Would you like yours first Mr . Sim ? <eos>
 Oh yeah ? <eos>
 It s a miracle . <eos>
 Mr . Sim ? Do you have him ? He s alive ? <eos>
 Oh yeah he s alive . Technically . <eos>
 And you have him ? <eos>
 We lost him . <eos>
 Can I help you Mrs . Argon ? <eos>
 He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now . <eos>
 You wo not . That s why you are whispering . <eos>
 Get him Daniel ! Knock his block off ! <eos>
 Do not worry four eyes . <eos>
 Paranoia s what separates the secured from the unsecured . <eos>
 Pipe down brain lady ! And you . <eos>
 To make a gentleman out of a tramp ? <eos>
 Exactly . <eos>
 Dexter . <eos>
 Yes s not it . <eos>
 Goodbye Stew <eos>
 I think you should Miss Gallagher . <eos>
 I do not mind her if you do not . <eos>
 Decent ? Why Miss Schuyler I want to be noble . <eos>
 No ? Why not ? <eos>
 Certainly . Right over there . <eos>
 You are all right . <eos>
 Yeah that was considerate of me . I recommend you read it . <eos>
 I am not interested in your literary recommendations . <eos>
 I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo . <eos>
 No give you another guess . <eos>
 So it s obvious huh ? <eos>
 Sure I will take a chance . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 For the letters of course . <eos>
 Of course I am Stewart . <eos>
 Now let s get this settled <eos>
 Listen Stew baby let s not talk about things like that now <eos>
 Gallagher ! <eos>
 Gallagher this s Mrs . Smith . <eos>
 Yes s not it ? <eos>
 I poisoned him . <eos>
 Stop trying to be funny and get ready will you ? <eos>
 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 I am talking about I am not going out . <eos>
 What am I going downstairs and tell those people ? <eos>
 Look out for my lipstick Stewart . <eos>
 Oh they are all right Anne . But I <eos>
 Good morning . What does this mean ? <eos>
 Stewart ! <eos>
 Oh hello Mother ! <eos>

 Well I got a seat but I have no place to put it . <eos>
 Yeah hello . How are you ? <eos>
 Thanks I will . <eos>
 Oh man ! <eos>
 Well I should say ! <eos>
 I knew your managing editor very well . <eos>
 Is that so ? <eos>
 Yale 21 I believe . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 We were classmates . <eos>
 As one Tribune man to another <eos>
 Why sure . It s a lotta hooey . <eos>
 All right all right do not mention it . <eos>
 Give my regards to your managing editor . <eos>
 I certainly will . <eos>

 Are you serious with this ? <eos>
 Yes . Sorry . <eos>
 Well . what do you want then ? <eos>
 I am sorry I know . I know that it s . <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 Hi Kathleen I am just working . <eos>
 Are you going to the party tonight ? <eos>
 Yes I am . <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 Right now you are doing nothing ? <eos>
 I am just talking on the phone to you and standing . <eos>
 What time are you gonna be there ? <eos>
 Seven o clock . <eos>
 You can not be late . <eos>
 I wo not . <eos>
 I am serious . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Seriously . <eos>
 Ok . <eos>
 You can not be late though . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Seriously . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 You can not just stay in your house . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Yeah but I am serious . <eos>
 Ok . <eos>
 I will see you there . <eos>
 I will see you there . <eos>
 Do not puss out . <eos>
 I wo not . <eos>
 When can you leave ? <eos>
 As soon as you want . <eos>
 I thought Latisha said you would <eos>
 she did not know what she was talking about <eos>
 It s . whatever . that s not cool . <eos>
 That s it . <eos>
 Can we maybe ask for more money on this ? <eos>
 I am only paying two of you guys . <eos>
 What s the problem ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 Put him through . <eos>
 No no . This s bad something might have happened we should just <eos>
 Are you learning how to play the piano ? What s that ? <eos>
 Are you sure ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Yeah no I have to get something from my car I said . <eos>
 Are you coming to eat with us ? <eos>
 Ok . <eos>
 Just tell him to call me . <eos>
 Ok . <eos>
 So . did my brother call you ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Well . he s not that strange do not say that . <eos>
 I am sorry . You are right . <eos>
 I think he s weird but that s me . <eos>
 Should I call you later ? <eos>
 I will just see you when you get back here . <eos>
 Ok . <eos>
 I am pleased to have the new post sir . <eos>
 It s remarkable Doctor . The patients are so subdued so docile . <eos>
 They have the satisfaction only a hard day s labor can provide . <eos>
 No one s forcing you to listen . <eos>
 Once or twice . <eos>
 Then what s he doing here ? <eos>
 Now give the signal . <eos>
 . a poker . he took a poker from the fire . <eos>
 Yes Abbe ? <eos>
 His stinking breath caused my eyes to run that s all . <eos>
 But why must you indulge in his pornography ? <eos>
 But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence ? <eos>
 He s not the man who s cast a shadow here . <eos>
 I have you to look after me have not I ? <eos>
 Turn you out ? <eos>
 Mother s not half so blind as you . <eos>
 What ? What have I done ? <eos>
 Do not come back not tonight not again <eos>
 You will hate me now wo not you ? <eos>
 Must not do that sir . <eos>
 I must grant him his last rites . <eos>
 I do not take my orders from you not anymore . <eos>
 You would deny a dying man his salvation ? <eos>
 It s not even noon <eos>
 I am not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption . <eos>
 Do not be so sure . <eos>
 What did you do ? Bribe one of the guards ? <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 Our future lies in the stroke of your pen . <eos>
 Mightier than the sword indeed . <eos>
 Do not be absurd it s only a play . <eos>
 How can one man possibly be so selfish ? <eos>
 You always do . <eos>
 Part the gates of heaven as it were <eos>
 That s enough . <eos>
 You are tense darling . You could use a long slow screw . <eos>
 Good day Marquis . <eos>
 THEN BUGGER ME ! <eos>
 His rug . <eos>
 Orvolle . His wine . From now on nothing but water at every meal <eos>
 water ! <eos>
 and your meat shall be de boned . <eos>
 Because your writing continues unchecked . <eos>
 A man after my own heart . <eos>
 What on earth would that require ? <eos>
 A night spent with the partner of my choice . <eos>
 You expect me to pimp Madeleine ? <eos>
 I was not talking about Madeleine . <eos>
 Coulmier you animal ! <eos>
 I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT MARQUIS ! <eos>
 Oh but you must my pumpkin ! Sex without flirtation s merely rape ! <eos>
 NOW STRIP . <eos>
 Your wig . Remove your wig . <eos>
 Your words drove Bouchon to <eos>
 Oh that s rich coming from her lapdog <eos>
 I saw the longing in your eye <eos>
 that was lust <eos>
 the passion in your heart <eos>
 I know because I felt it myself <eos>
 I WANTED TO FUCK HER THAT S ALL ! <eos>
 AND DID YOU ? <eos>
 IT S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK . <eos>
 Why was it you never took her by force ? <eos>
 Who s to say I did not ? <eos>
 Was it impotence ? <eos>
 NEVER ! <eos>
 Then it must have been love <eos>
 I am here . <eos>
 Surely you will grant me a final word . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It s a formality truly . <eos>
 A few indiscretions in his youth . <eos>
 His wife s influence . <eos>
 His wife s ? <eos>
 Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one . <eos>
 Well . <eos>
 For sale ? To the general public ? Certainly not it s unprintable . <eos>
 In their eyes the Marquis s the surest barometer of your progress here . <eos>
 But he s one among some two hundred wards <eos>
 And place my reputation at stake ? <eos>
 He s sworn to obedience . <eos>
 then I have friends of my own to visit . <eos>
 Oh indeed ? <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It was not inspired by circumstance . <eos>
 No . It most certainly was not . <eos>
 What could cause a tincture like this ? <eos>
 It s a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children <eos>
 This child let loose the beast from its cage <eos>
 You would suffer in her stead ? <eos>
 I beg you Doctor do not make me say it . <eos>
 HER NAME ABBE . <eos>
 And my own . <eos>
 How s the patient faring ? <eos>
 Poorly . <eos>
 And you ? It must have been an ordeal . <eos>
 No sir . Plainly put I never expect to sleep again . <eos>
 No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses . <eos>
 Maybe someday you will tell me your name . <eos>
 Sweet then ? Like the pastry ? <eos>
 Come now darling give it a read . <eos>
 Well worth the dig ! <eos>
 Now s not the time to be cheeky Maddy . <eos>
 Do not start <eos>
 Go ahead you have a key . Slip it through my tiny hole . <eos>
 I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours . <eos>
 There s something else I want from you . <eos>
 I have just the story . inspired by these very surroundings . <eos>
 Most assuredly . <eos>
 Is it terribly erotic ? <eos>
 Fiendishly so . <eos>
 Must I administer them directly or might I blow them ? <eos>
 The price my coquette s every bit as firm as I am . <eos>
 Oh you . You talk same as you write . <eos>
 The climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap . <eos>
 You demand a lot from your readers you do . <eos>
 What s that then ? <eos>
 They decreed me a savage and now they have made me one . <eos>
 It s only been described to me . In your books . <eos>
 You are far crueler than I my sweet . <eos>
 How do you propose I write it ? With dust upon the air ? <eos>
 You could whisper it through the walls of your cell . <eos>
 Go on child . <eos>
 A tale more horrible than all the rest combined ! <eos>
 Something to make the angels weep and the Saints to gasp for air . <eos>
 No . But tell him I would . <eos>
 Desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy . <eos>
 My schedule s not subject to the whims of lunatics . <eos>
 What a beautiful thought Marquise . <eos>
 What thought s that ? <eos>
 That ill gotten funds borne of his degeneracy might now effect his salvation . <eos>
 words alone are insufficient . <eos>
 It s beyond perversity . That honor should carry a price tag . <eos>
 And I in yours . <eos>
 Doctor . Can I impart to you his cruelest trick ? <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 . shame on you truly . <eos>
 To flaunt your deviance in public ? Upon a stage ? <eos>
 They have put you up to this have not they ? <eos>
 You ought to court the Doctor s favor not his contempt . <eos>
 But it s just begun <eos>
 Do as I say . <eos>
 Very much . <eos>
 You prefer a book to your husband s company ? <eos>
 No when I was but a tender lad <eos>
 Last week would this be ? <eos>
 Not you too <eos>
 It s gonna be fine Orson . You are gonna do great . <eos>
 I wonder sometimes . <eos>
 You are just scared . <eos>
 Am I ? <eos>
 You need to get outta here Rapunzel <eos>
 Mm . <eos>
 Sure you can just <eos>
 He needs me here . <eos>
 Sure <eos>

 Nope . <eos>
 Showing life <eos>

 We find the man and then we dissect him <eos>
 Like a bug . <eos>
 But with compassion and insight <eos>
 Christ we gotta go ! The old man does not cotton to lateness . <eos>
 Sure . Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah <eos>
 Who the hell s Manolete ? <eos>
 The great Spanish bullfighter <eos>

 K A N E . One strong syllable . Kane I <eos>

 He has it . Thank you . <eos>
 Goodnight . <eos>
 I will pull somebody out of Japan . <eos>
 Name me a better photographer . <eos>
 But his leg ! <eos>
 Do not worry it comes off today . <eos>
 That s what they call a family problem . <eos>
 I think you saw something that probably has a very simple explanation . <eos>
 For instance ? <eos>
 His wife took a trip . <eos>
 She was an invalid ! <eos>
 You told me . I have got to run Jeff . <eos>
 All right you do not believe me . <eos>
 I was jaywalking . <eos>
 She never left the apartment <eos>
 Then where s she in the ice box ? <eos>
 until yesterday morning . <eos>
 What time ? <eos>
 Six ayem . <eos>
 Not yet . <eos>
 Who left where ? <eos>
 The Thorwalds at six in the morning ? <eos>
 If possible both . <eos>
 A detective s nightmare . <eos>
 Ever get an answer ? <eos>
 Yeah frequently it ran something like this Your request for transfer turned down <eos>
 Oh I almost forgot ! <eos>
 Mrs . Thorwald . <eos>
 Everything he owns s laid out on the bedroom ready for packing . <eos>
 He has his wife s jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there . <eos>
 You sure it belongs to his wife ? <eos>
 You figured that out huh ? <eos>
 Well in the garage back home we <eos>
 Your logic s backward . <eos>
 This s Doyle Jeff . <eos>
 Tom I have got something real big for you . <eos>
 Your Lisa ? <eos>
 Precinct Six . I sent a friend over with bail money . <eos>
 Maybe you wo not need it . I will run it down Jeff . <eos>
 Congratulations Jeff . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 For getting rid of that cast . <eos>
 Who said I was getting rid of it ? <eos>
 Wrong week . Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon . <eos>
 Okay . When do I leave ? Half hour ? An hour ? <eos>
 With that cast on you do not . <eos>
 So did you . Goodbye Jeff . <eos>
 Next time have some good news . <eos>
 Gunnison ? <eos>
 Yeah . Is that you Jeff ? <eos>
 It s me . <eos>
 Something wrong ? <eos>
 The word s everything . Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday ? <eos>
 Jeff <eos>
 That s more like it . Goodnight old buddy . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Did you get my note ? <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 For a little business meeting to settle the estate of your late wife . <eos>
 I do not know what you mean . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Tell her to bring it back ! <eos>
 Then if the police get me you wo not be around to laugh ! <eos>
 Well I only quote from the best . <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 You have got a hormone deficiency . <eos>
 How can you tell that from a thermometer ! <eos>
 Do not you ever heat that stuff up . <eos>
 Gives your circulation something to fight . What kind of trouble ? <eos>
 Lisa Fremont . <eos>
 That s normal . <eos>
 I do not want to . <eos>
 That s abnormal . <eos>
 I am not ready for marriage . <eos>
 Her father loading up the shotgun ? <eos>
 Stella ! <eos>
 She s only perfect . <eos>
 Intelligence ! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble . Modern marriage ! <eos>
 Eyes bloodshot . Must have been staring out the window for hours . <eos>
 I was . <eos>
 What will you do if one of them catches you ? <eos>
 Depends one which one . <eos>
 She s real eat drink and be merry girl . <eos>
 And she will end up fat alcoholic and miserable . <eos>
 Speaking of misery Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again . Alone . <eos>
 Poor girl . Someday she will find her happiness . <eos>
 And some man will lose his . <eos>
 He and his wife splitting up ? <eos>
 Now what could he sell at three in the morning ? <eos>
 Flashlights . Luminous dials for watches . House numbers that light up . <eos>
 He was taking something out of the apartment . I am certain . <eos>
 Sometimes it s worse to stay than it s to run . <eos>
 But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it . <eos>
 No . The shades are still drawn in their apartment . <eos>
 In this heat ? They are up now . <eos>
 Get back there ! He will see you ! <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 You called the police ? <eos>
 I will watch the alleyway in case it goes that way . <eos>
 And digging in . Look at that flower bed . <eos>
 Look ! <eos>
 I have a feeling we have just begun . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules . <eos>
 You can tell that from here ? <eos>
 Got a shovel ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 There s probably one in the basement . <eos>
 Now wait a minute <eos>
 Smart ? She will be arrested ! <eos>
 That will get her out of there wo not it ? <eos>
 To bail Lisa out of jail . <eos>
 How much do you think you will need ? <eos>
 First offense burglary probably two fifty . The piggy bank . <eos>
 Thirty three here . Totals one ninety . Not enough . <eos>
 When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont they will even contribute . <eos>
 Mrs . Doyle ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Jeff again . Has Tom come in yet ? <eos>
 Not yet Jeff . <eos>
 You have not even heard from him ? <eos>
 Not a word . <eos>
 I am afraid it s Tess . <eos>
 I will have him call the moment I hear from him . <eos>
 He knows . Do not worry Tess . It s a man . <eos>
 Goodnight you idiot . <eos>
 Goodnight Mrs Doyle . <eos>
 Mmmm hurts a little . <eos>
 And your stomach ? <eos>
 Empty as a football . <eos>
 And you love life ? <eos>
 Not too active . <eos>
 Anything else bothering you ? <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 Only because it s expected of her . <eos>
 That dress should be listed on the stock exchange . <eos>
 We sell a dozen a day in this price range . <eos>
 Who buys them ? Tax collectors ? <eos>
 Going on right here . It s a big night . <eos>
 I wanted to Jeff . Oh ! <eos>
 You have perhaps an ambulance outside ? <eos>
 Fine . Corkscrew s on the right . <eos>
 Well I am going to make this a week you will never forget . <eos>
 Tired ? <eos>
 She looked very cool . She had on a mint green <eos>
 That s good news . <eos>
 Someday you might want to open up your own studio here . <eos>
 How could I run it from say Pakistan ? <eos>
 Make the one you want . <eos>
 You mean leave the magazine ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 She s not in love with him or any of them . <eos>
 How can you tell that from here ? <eos>
 You said it resembled my apartment did not you ? <eos>
 No wonder he s having so much trouble with it . <eos>
 Of course not . <eos>
 Right now it does not seem so . <eos>
 You mean goodnight . <eos>
 I mean what I said . <eos>
 Without any future ? <eos>
 I have one now . <eos>
 So do I . <eos>
 Tell me about it . <eos>
 Why has not he gone into his wife s bedroom all day ? <eos>
 I would not dare answer that . <eos>
 Lisa there s something terribly wrong . <eos>
 Something too frightful to utter . <eos>
 Now Lisa <eos>
 What s it you are looking for ? <eos>
 Where s the doctor the undertakers ? <eos>
 She could be under sedatives sleeping . He s in the room now . <eos>
 There s nothing to see . <eos>
 You could see all the things he did could not you ? <eos>
 What are you getting at ? <eos>
 Do not you see how silly you are being ? <eos>
 125 West Ninth Street . <eos>
 To get on home . <eos>
 All right but what s he doing now ? <eos>
 What about it ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Suppose he does not come back again ? <eos>
 He will . All his things are still piled on the bed . <eos>
 Not yet ! <eos>
 Thinking about Thorwald ? <eos>
 It does not make sense to me . <eos>
 What does not ? <eos>
 Women are not that unpredictable . <eos>
 Lisa I can not guess what you are thinking . <eos>
 That s what the witnesses told him . <eos>
 Night . I am going to stay with you . <eos>
 You will have to clear that through my landlord <eos>
 Well that s fine but I only have one bed and <eos>
 Lisa I wo not be able to give you any <eos>
 A Mark Cross overnight case anyway . Compact but ample enough . <eos>
 I would be no better than Thorwald to refuse . <eos>
 It s utterly beautiful . I wish I could be creative . <eos>
 You are . You have a talent for creating difficult situations . <eos>
 I do ? <eos>
 Staying the night here uninvited . <eos>

 She said it on her tape . <eos>
 Why did not you tell me ? <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Do not you want to make one ? <eos>
 Yes . But I sense the element of revenge here . <eos>
 What difference does it make why I do it ? <eos>
 That s a good question . <eos>
 What do you have to do to get ready ? <eos>
 Load a new tape turn the camera on . <eos>
 Then do it . <eos>

 Yes . <eos>
 Sometimes . Afterward . <eos>
 Does he go down on you ? <eos>
 Absolutely not . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband ? <eos>
 Then as far as this taping goes you have nothing to worry about . <eos>
 I guess not . <eos>
 Do you want me to stop ? <eos>
 Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 About who ? <eos>

 That s correct . <eos>
 So you have had sex . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Who was the last person you had sex with ? <eos>
 Her name was Elizabeth . <eos>
 So what happened ? Was it so bad that it turned you off ? <eos>
 No it was wonderful . That was not the problem . <eos>
 What was the problem ? <eos>
 Yes . I did . Willfully and repeatedly . <eos>
 How come ? <eos>
 Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me . <eos>
 Do not you get lonely ? <eos>
 I am babbling . <eos>
 No you are not . <eos>
 God I am so mad at him ! <eos>
 You should be . He lied to you . So did Cynthia . <eos>
 I am not planning on it . <eos>
 I am not in love with you . <eos>
 But if you were ? <eos>
 I . I can not answer that precisely . <eos>
 But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you . <eos>
 That s very flattering . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 I have told you . <eos>
 But I do not understand <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You mean you are still in contact with her ? <eos>

 I do not care . <eos>
 No . <eos>

 Are you having an affair ? <eos>
 No I am not . Frankly I am offended at the accusation . <eos>
 I am not either ! <eos>
 Why do not I believe you ? <eos>
 Yeah . Jeez give me some credit . <eos>
 I did not say it was rational I just said I was convinced . <eos>
 Is not therapy helping at all ? <eos>

 That you are under no obligation to me ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>

 Maybe we ought to ask Stella . <eos>
 This s a lot of money . <eos>
 I told you this was a sweet set up . <eos>
 It s that . <eos>
 Maybe you could run it without Stella . <eos>
 Well thanks but forget it . <eos>
 Nothing . Do nothing . Do not get between us . <eos>
 I am a great believer in doing nothing . <eos>
 So we understand each other ? <eos>
 Yeah maybe I will too . <eos>

 Cobb s got something on you and it must be pretty good . <eos>
 If he did not you would never sit still while this was happening . <eos>
 You sure ? Maybe that s the kind of friend I am . <eos>
 I am ready for that . <eos>
 I do not want you to get hurt . <eos>
 He can not hurt me if he s dead . <eos>
 You better get in there with her until this thing s over . <eos>

 If anyone asks about Simone <eos>
 I know I do not know anything . <eos>

 You know me married to my work . <eos>

 Then when s he going to Engineering ? <eos>
 Full disruptors . <eos>
 Thanks for pointing that out . <eos>
 Can you project its course ? <eos>
 Veridian III s uninhabited but Veridian IV supports a pre industrial humanoid society . <eos>
 Population ? <eos>
 Approximately two hundred thirty million . <eos>
 Commander . <eos>
 I have to find a way to get to Soran . <eos>
 I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response . <eos>
 Really ? What do you feel ? <eos>
 You get what ? <eos>
 I know . I just got it . It was very funny . <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 It appears to be a magnetically sealed . <eos>
 I am sorry but I cannot stop myself . I think something s wrong <eos>
 I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays . <eos>
 We better get you back to the ship La Forge to Enterprise . <eos>
 One minute to warp core breach . <eos>
 The station complement was nineteen . <eos>
 We all are Data . But we are going to get him back . <eos>
 I hope so sir . <eos>
 On screen . <eos>
 Beam them directly to Sickbay . <eos>
 I will go . You have the Bridge . <eos>
 You are in the Nexus . <eos>
 For you . This s where you wanted to be . <eos>
 But I never had a wife children a home like this . <eos>
 Enjoy them Jean Luc . <eos>
 All of us . <eos>
 Where s he now ? <eos>
 Wherever he wanted to be . <eos>
 Why would you want to leave ? <eos>
 Can I ? <eos>
 Yes where would you go ? <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 Please please . <eos>
 Oh of course . <eos>
 Please I insist . <eos>
 You left spacedock without a tractor beam ? <eos>
 Yes yes it is . <eos>
 I am from what you would consider the future the 24th century . <eos>
 Temporal nexus yeah I heard you . Something s missing . <eos>
 Better ? <eos>
 This s my uncle s barn in Iowa . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Close to retirement ? <eos>
 I had not planned on it . <eos>
 I take it the odds are against us and the situation s grim ? <eos>
 You could say that . <eos>
 Yes . Thank you . <eos>
 Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise . <eos>
 What do you mean you are not going ? We promised . <eos>
 And what would that be sir ? <eos>
 Sulu . When did he find the time for a family ? <eos>
 I thought you might . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 Load torpedo bays prepare to fire on my command . <eos>
 I always do . <eos>
 Captain I do not know how much longer I can hold her together ! <eos>
 Normal s what everyone else s and what you are not . <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 What about Guinan ? What has she told you about me ? <eos>
 Guinan ? I do not know what you are talking about . <eos>
 Make it so . <eos>
 We think they were looking for something they practically tore the place apart . <eos>
 Is there a problem ? <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 Thank you Number One . <eos>
 Sir s there anything wrong ? <eos>
 No . Thank you . <eos>
 Too big . How long until the ribbon arrives ? <eos>
 Yes . Fine . If you will excuse me . <eos>
 Mr . Data scan the planet for lifeforms . <eos>
 Yes yes Captain . Thank you for coming . <eos>
 The thought had crossed my mind . <eos>
 The Nexus . <eos>
 Time has no meaning there . The predator has no teeth . <eos>
 You see the top yardarm now look to the <eos>
 There are no other ships in the system . <eos>
 Well that narrows it to Klingon Breen or Romulan . <eos>
 Lock phasers and return fire ! <eos>
 And we are gaining . Stand by tractor beam ! <eos>
 Tractor beam aye ! <eos>
 Execute ! <eos>
 Sure whatever games you wanna play . <eos>
 Soon Captain . Quite soon . <eos>
 An energy reading from C deck from inside Mr . Spock s quarters . <eos>
 Mr . Chekov I ordered Spock s quarters sealed ! <eos>
 Yes . He has a long journey ahead . <eos>
 Mr . Scott we need everything you have got now . <eos>
 Sir Starfleet calling Grissom again . A warning about us . <eos>
 Response ? <eos>
 Nothing . As before . <eos>
 Keep trying Chekov . At regular intervals . <eos>
 Bones . Can you give me a quadrant bi scan ? <eos>
 What did you see Chekov ? <eos>
 For an instant . A scout class vessel . <eos>
 Short range scan Mr . Chekov . On screen Mr . Sulu . <eos>
 Scotty . <eos>
 Dr . Marcus it s your planet . <eos>
 Locate . <eos>
 Surge from astern sir . Aft quarter ! <eos>
 On screen . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 David . Sorry I am late . <eos>
 I went wrong . <eos>
 It s snow . Snow in the same sector . Fantastic ! <eos>
 . Fascinating . <eos>
 It s a little early to celebrate . <eos>
 Underground deposit ? <eos>
 Negative on surface . A manufactured object . <eos>
 There s only one thing it could be . Short range scan . <eos>
 A photon tube . <eos>
 Short range scan . <eos>
 . Radiation residual . Level s minimal . <eos>
 I will handle that later . <eos>
 My readings indicate great instability . <eos>
 David <eos>
 Spock s burial robe . <eos>
 Grissom your message acknowledged . Will advise . Out . <eos>
 It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack . <eos>
 You mean we are stranded down here ? <eos>
 Logic indicates that s the case . <eos>
 Why do not you just call for u help u ! <eos>
 I have already made one transmission too many . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix . <eos>
 Did your collaborator know ? <eos>
 If I had not it might have been years or never ! <eos>
 And Spock with it . They are joined together . <eos>
 I will go . <eos>
 No ! I will do it . Give me your phaser . <eos>
 You said there would not be any . <eos>
 Yes Saavik go ahead . <eos>
 Well all the same I am going to advise Starfleet and get instructions . <eos>
 We are under attack ! Stand by for evasive stand by for <eos>
 I would be grateful Admiral if you would give the word . <eos>
 Gentlemen . may the wind be at our backs . Stations please ! <eos>
 Sir . <eos>
 The u doors u Mr . Scott ! <eos>
 Scan for vessels in pursuit ! <eos>
 Aye sir ! <eos>
 Aye those two hits should stop a horse let alone a bird . <eos>
 Precautionary Mr . Chekov . Shields up . <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 Just him sir ! <eos>
 Bones help Spock ! Everyone else find a station ! <eos>
 Saavik . Is . David with you ? <eos>
 Yes he is . And someone else . Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance . <eos>
 This Vulcan s he alive ? <eos>
 He gave his life to save us . That s all I know . <eos>
 Goodbye David . <eos>
 What ? What are you saying ? <eos>
 . He will remain always as he is . <eos>
 Much s at stake . <eos>
 Yes . And I know you . <eos>
 Why would you do this . <eos>
 Because . the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many . <eos>
 The ship . Out of danger . <eos>
 She s to be decommissioned . <eos>
 The word s no . I am therefore going anyway . <eos>
 Count on our help sir . <eos>
 I will need it Sulu . <eos>
 FULL IMPULSE POWER ! <eos>
 Aye sir Warp Speed . <eos>
 Mr . Scott as good as your word . <eos>
 Can we hold speed Mr . Scott ? <eos>
 Yes sir . It s getting larger as we close in . <eos>
 I think it s an energy form sir . <eos>
 Yes . Enough energy to hide a ship would not you say ? <eos>
 . A cloaking device ? <eos>
 Red alert Mr . Scott . <eos>
 Fire Mr . Scott ! <eos>
 About a dozen officers and men . <eos>
 With some on the planet . <eos>
 What about surface life signs . <eos>
 Close . There <eos>
 Come on ! <eos>
 Go Sulu ! <eos>
 Best speed to Vulcan . Mr . Chekov take the prisoners below . <eos>
 Saavik . Send to Ambassador Sarek . Tell him we are coming in . <eos>
 It s been a while sir . Here we go . Retrothrusters ! <eos>
 No sir no response . <eos>
 Hmm . Very odd . Scotty . Progress report ? <eos>
 Approach control . this s Enterprise . Ready for docking maneuver . <eos>
 My friends the great experiment Excelsior ready for trial runs . <eos>
 Good evening Commander . Everything ready ? <eos>
 Yes Admiral . Step into my parlor . <eos>
 Welcome home Jim . <eos>
 Indisposed sir . <eos>
 Genesis ? Whatever for ? <eos>
 Why a natural desire to help finish the work we began ! <eos>
 That s out of the question . No one s going to Genesis ! <eos>
 May I ask why . <eos>
 Then I will find a ship I will hire a ship . <eos>
 Any time . <eos>
 Torpedoes coming in ! <eos>
  <eos>
 No tricks . I am looking forward to meeting you . Kirk out . <eos>
 You should take the Vulcan too . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 Because you wish it . <eos>
 Beam the Vulcan up And we talk . <eos>
 Give me what I want and I will consider it . <eos>
 You fool look around you ! This planet s destroying itself ! <eos>
 Yes . Exhilarating s not it ! <eos>
 If we do not help each other we will all die here ! <eos>
  <eos>
 Do not be a fool give me your hand ! <eos>
 Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 Then how <eos>
 Kirk I must have your thoughts . May I join your mind ? <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He asked you not to grieve . <eos>
 . Yes . <eos>
 . The needs of the many outweigh . <eos>
 . The needs of the few . <eos>
 . Or the one . <eos>
 . Spock . <eos>
 Sarek ! What if he melded with someone else ? <eos>
 One alive one not . Yet both in pain . <eos>
 What must I do ? <eos>
 But at what cost ? Your ship . Your son . <eos>
 If I had not tried the cost would have been my soul . <eos>
 Great power . to control . dominate . destroy . If it works . <eos>
 Understood my lord . <eos>
 Station ! <eos>
 Say the wrong thing Torg and I will kill you too ! <eos>
 But sir ! Federation Starship approaching . <eos>
 Good . This s the turn of luck I have been waiting for . <eos>
 They know we would die first . <eos>
 I trust my instincts . Admiral Kirk . This s your opponent speaking . <eos>
 Yes my lord ! <eos>
 Steady . Continue on impulse power . <eos>
  <eos>
 Wait ! Wait . <eos>
  <eos>
 Put him on screen ! Study him well . <eos>
 How s that . <eos>
 Well what are we going to do about it ? <eos>
 This s not reality . This s fantasy . <eos>
 It s new have you any idea what you are saying ? <eos>
 You are not going in there ! <eos>
 I am afraid I can not stop to discuss this logically <eos>
 That s all you have to say ? <eos>
 I am not a drama critic . <eos>
 Beware Romulans bearing gifts . Happy Birthday . <eos>
 I only use it for medicinal purposes . Do not be a pring . <eos>
 Twenty two eighty three . <eos>
 Takes the stuff a while to ferment . Gimme . <eos>
 More antiques for your collection Cheers ! <eos>
 Exactly . Happy birthday . <eos>
 Say thank you . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 And who am I hiding from ? <eos>
 From yourself Admiral . <eos>
 Ah . <eos>
 The inspection will continue once we are underway Doctor . <eos>
 Where u they u went . Saavik . <eos>
 Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all . <eos>
 Our first order of business s survival . <eos>
 It s like the Garden of Eden . <eos>
 We each face death every day we are alive Saavik . <eos>
 I am taking this bunch to sick bay . <eos>
 Young . I feel young Doctor . <eos>
 I have my orders . <eos>
 Message breaking up Carol . What s wrong ? What s wrong ? <eos>

 What order ? Who s taking Genesis ? <eos>
 Jim please <eos>
 Something Spock was trying to tell me . On my birthday . <eos>
 Mother go back ! <eos>
 Go back . I am going to kill him . <eos>
 You do that and you will have murdered your father . <eos>
 We have picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner . <eos>
 Damn ! Are you sure ? Maybe the scanner s out of adjustment <eos>
 Captain this s the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI <eos>
 I can hardly see <eos>
 I saw it ! <eos>
 There s an air lock . <eos>
 Ssssh ! <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 Never mind ! Hurry ! <eos>
 What do you want with us ? I demand <eos>
 Umm . And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information ? <eos>
 I would think so sir . He s on the Fleet General Staff . <eos>
 Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis ? <eos>
 I am Doctor Marcus ! <eos>
 She s making it up ! My father was Professor <eos>
 We appear to have plenty of time . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 He s on a build up to detonation ! <eos>
 How soon <eos>
 We encoded four minutes <eos>
 We will beam aboard and stop it <eos>
 You can not ! <eos>
 Uh no . I should be on the bridge . <eos>
 Are you running away from me ? <eos>
 I did not expect anything . <eos>
 So am I . My friends were killed too . <eos>
 I am truly sorry . <eos>
 Is that what you came here to say ? <eos>
 Only half of you would get there . <eos>
 The Admiral s son . <eos>
 Do not you believe it . <eos>
 Oh I believe it . <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Let them eat static . <eos>
 They are still running with shields down . <eos>
 Raise them <eos>
 u Where s the over ride u ? <eos>
 Warp drive still inoperative . All other systems should be restored shortly . <eos>
 Visual <eos>
 Rake her . <eos>
 u Full power damn you u ! <eos>
 Inoperative . <eos>
 Raise the shields . <eos>
 I shall avenge you <eos>
 Do not play with me Kirk my hand s on the phaser control <eos>
 Give me some time to recall the data on our computers <eos>
 I give you sixty seconds Admiral . <eos>
 Here it comes . Now Spock . <eos>
 All s well sir . You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis . <eos>
 First things first Captain . Kill Admiral Kirk . <eos>
 We will be going to warp speed <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 Just the batteries sir . I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes <eos>
 We do not have minutes . Can you give me phaser power ? <eos>
 A few shots sir . <eos>
 I am going down to the station . <eos>
 Uhura send to Commander Reliant prepare to be boarded . <eos>
 I am trying sir . Stand by . <eos>
 Try the emergency channels . <eos>
 Enterprise to Reliant . Come in Reliant . <eos>
 Picture Mr . Saavik . <eos>
 Scotty let s have it . <eos>
 Admiral <eos>
 Do it while we have time . <eos>
 Sensors Captain ? <eos>
 I say again . This s Enterprise . Please acknowledge signal . Please <eos>
 I had me a wee bout but Dr . McCoy pulled me through . <eos>
 Oh ? A wee bout of what Mr . Scott ? <eos>
 My sister s youngest Admiral . Crazy to get to space . <eos>
 Mr . Scott the word s given . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 He will die ! <eos>
 Admiral this s Spock . <eos>
 Engine room reports auxiliary power restored . We can proceed at impulse power . <eos>
 Not at present . <eos>
 Midshipman First Class Peter Preston engineers mate SIR . <eos>
 Yes SIR . <eos>
 I see . Well shall we start with the engine room ? <eos>
 The word s given warp speed . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality . <eos>
 The Enterprise . I must check in before your inspection . And you ? <eos>
 Home . <eos>
 To be sure Captain . <eos>
 Twelve hours and forty three minutes present speed . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 The power of creation <eos>
 Have they proceeded with their experiments ? <eos>
 Chekov s on Reliant s not he ? <eos>
 It would explain a great many things <eos>
 Visual ! Mr . Sulu divert everything to the phasers <eos>
 Too late <eos>
 Who the u hell u are they ? <eos>
 It s all we have got . <eos>
 Affirmative Admiral . <eos>
 A distinct possibility . <eos>
 Engine room . Scotty do we have enough power for the transporters ? <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 Not much Admiral . We have partial main power . <eos>
 That s it ? <eos>
 Best we could do in two hours . <eos>
 Steady as you go . <eos>
 Uhura patch me in <eos>
 The ship out of danger ? <eos>
 Yes <eos>
 Or the one . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 Transmission jammed at the source sir . <eos>
 Damn . Alert Starfleet Headquarters . I want to talk with Starfleet Command . <eos>
 Prayer Mr . Saavik . The Klingons do not take prisoners . Captain . <eos>
 Permission to speak candidly sir ? <eos>
 Very well . <eos>
 I do not believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities . <eos>
 And why not ? <eos>
 Because . there was no way to win . <eos>
 Then you have something new to think about . Carry on . <eos>
 It s still regulation Admiral . <eos>
 Lieutenant self expression does not seem to be one of your problems . <eos>
 I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating . <eos>
 You earned it . <eos>
 I did not think so . <eos>
 You are bothered by your performance on the u Kobayashi Maru u . <eos>
 I failed to resolve the situation . <eos>
 There s no correct resolution . It s a test of character . <eos>
 May I ask how u you u dealt with the test ? <eos>
 You may ask Lieutenant . <eos>
 Humor . that s a difficult concept . it s not logical . <eos>
 We learn by doing Lieutenant . <eos>
 Take the test again . <eos>
 Energize defense fields . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 HURRY . <eos>
 Phasers on stun . Move out . <eos>
 Erased . <eos>
 The u Kobayashi Maru u sir . <eos>
 I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship . <eos>
 u WHAT u ? <eos>
 . no uncoded messages on an open channel . <eos>
 They just do not want us going in there . <eos>
 At what . <eos>
 All stop sir . <eos>
 Descend ten thousand meters . Stand by photon torpedoes . <eos>
 Power levels quite low sir . <eos>
 Mr . Scott can you get the mains back on line ? <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Two minutes ten seconds . <eos>
 Engine room ! What s happening ? <eos>
 Three minutes thirty seconds . <eos>
 Distance from Reliant . <eos>
 I will be in my quarters if needed but I would prefer . <eos>
 Understood sir . <eos>
 Dismiss the company . <eos>
 As you were Mr . Saavik . <eos>
 Aye sir . On course to Ceti Alpha . All s well . <eos>
 Good I believe you already know my uh son <eos>
 Aye sir <eos>
 Stop engines . <eos>
 Engage warp engines <eos>
 Visual . <eos>
 Trying sir ! <eos>
 Scotty ! <eos>
 Phasers locked . <eos>
 Try again . <eos>
 Battle stations . <eos>
 Best guess Mr . Sulu . Fire when ready . <eos>
 Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone . <eos>
 Aye Captain . <eos>
 I am aware of my responsibilities Mister . <eos>
 . Now entering the Neutral Zone . <eos>
 Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission . <eos>
 Aft thrusters sir . <eos>
 Course heading Captain ? <eos>
 Ready sir . <eos>
 No power to the weapons system sir . <eos>
 What did you expect Lieutenant ? <eos>
 He s very human . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Thank you Mr . Saavik . <eos>
 Never sir . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 By the book . <eos>
 I exaggerated . <eos>
 You are half human . The Computer knows that . <eos>
 The question s irrelevant . <eos>
 To Earth . To offer testimony . <eos>
 You do this for friendship ? <eos>
 I do this because I was there <eos>
 . They do indeed . <eos>
 Just a couple of kooks . <eos>
 Fine . Just fine . <eos>
 Gillian <eos>
 Indeed . May I offer you gentlemen anything ? <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 A moment alone please . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 Are you sure ? That s what I thought . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu . Take us home . <eos>
 Dammit Jim they have made him into a goddam green blooded computer ! <eos>
 No way somebody has to keep an eye on him ! <eos>
 We have done it before . <eos>
 That s crazy ! <eos>
 If you have a better idea now s the time . <eos>
 Cramps . <eos>
 Tearing of the middle meningeal artery . <eos>
 Come on Pavel . <eos>
 Pavel can you hear me ? Give me your name and rank . <eos>
 Not me Bones . They did it . <eos>
 Uhura s busy . I am monitoring . <eos>
 A joke s a story with a humorous climax . <eos>
 You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death ? <eos>
 Pardon me Doctor I am hearing many calls of distress . <eos>
 That s what I said Doctor . <eos>
 Then how . <eos>
 Hamlet Act I scene 4 . <eos>
 Acceleration s no longer a constant . <eos>
 Well you are gonna have to take your best shot . <eos>
 . Best shot . <eos>
 Guess Spock . Your best guess . <eos>
 Guessing s not in my nature . <eos>
 Well nobody s perfect . <eos>
 It is . <eos>
 We are just observing . <eos>
 I was not informed about observers . <eos>
 Reading the patient s vital signs . <eos>
 How do you explain slowing pulse low respiratory rate and coma ? <eos>
 Fundoscopic examination <eos>
 Fundoscopic examination s unrevealing in these cases ! <eos>
 A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure . <eos>
 Captain their call s being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power ! <eos>
 Can you isolate the wave ? <eos>
 Negative . It s impacting on all our systems ! <eos>
 Yes under U . S . Government . Now we need directions . <eos>
 I have the coordinates of the reactor . <eos>
 . It gives me a great sense of history . <eos>
 Depends on how much shielding s between us and the reactor . <eos>
 Like what ? <eos>
 The top of what ? <eos>
 Name ? <eos>
 My name ? <eos>
 No u my u name . <eos>
 I do not know your name . <eos>
 You play games with me and you are through <eos>
 I am ? May I go now ? <eos>
 I am wery sorry but <eos>
 That s odd . Uhura what s on the Comm channels . <eos>
 Shields aye . <eos>
 May fortune favor the foolish . Mr . Sulu Warp Speed ! <eos>
 Sir heat shields at maximum ! <eos>
 And Admiral it s the Enterprise . <eos>
 Understood . What s your plan ? <eos>
 Stabilize Energy Reserve ! Report helm <eos>
 Mr . Sulu switch to manual control ! <eos>
 We are launching everything we have . <eos>
 Communicate ? Communicate what ? You have no right to be here ! <eos>
 The hell they did . <eos>
 I was not . <eos>
 Is there something wrong with the one I have ? <eos>
 I buy that . What about him ? <eos>
 You have already been that . C mon . <eos>
 Uh huh . What about you ? Where you from ? <eos>
 Iowa . <eos>
 Go ahead . <eos>
 What s going to happen when you release the whales ? <eos>
 What does that mean exactly ? Take their chances . <eos>
 Well that s something . I would a let you off right here . <eos>
 Very likely . You are not exactly catching us at our best . <eos>
 How did you know Gracie s pregnant ? Nobody knows that . <eos>
 It s his way . <eos>
 Implicitly . <eos>
 You are upset about losing the whales . <eos>
 . You are very perceptive . <eos>
 How will that be done exactly ? <eos>
 They will be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there . <eos>
 Flown . And that s the last you will see of them ? <eos>
 Hm ? <eos>
 My whales ? Where could you take them where they would be safe ? <eos>
 It s not so much a matter of a place as of time . <eos>
 Sorry the time would have to be right now . <eos>
 What do you mean now ? <eos>
 What s what ? <eos>
 You got a pocket pager ? What are you a doctor ? <eos>
 Tell me when the whales are going to be released ? <eos>
 . Who are you ? <eos>
 Who do you think I am ? <eos>
 No I am from Iowa . I just work in outer space . <eos>
 I am all ears . <eos>
 You want the details ? <eos>
 So . There we are . <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 Have I flipped out ? . Is any of this real ? <eos>
 It s all real . Look . The storage tanks for the whales . <eos>
 But Kirk . <eos>
 . Gone ? <eos>
 A spaceship with a missing man . <eos>
 Calm yourself Nurse . Scotty get us out of here ! <eos>
 Yes . If you have a chart on board I can show you . <eos>
 All I need s the radio frequency to track them . <eos>
 What are you talking about ? I am coming with you . <eos>
 You can not . Our next stop s the 23rd Century . <eos>
 What do I care ? I have got nobody but those whales . <eos>
 Thank you . For everything . Beam me up Scotty . <eos>
 You need me . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu full power descent ! <eos>
 Why does it have to be goodbye ? <eos>
 Permission granted . <eos>
 Thank you Admiral . <eos>
 Jim Spock Jim . Remember . <eos>
 To the on board computer room . To confirm my suspicion . <eos>
 As suspected the Probe s transmissions are the songs sung by whales . <eos>
 Whales ? <eos>
 The sounds but not the language . We would be responding in gibberish . <eos>
 Is there any other planet where this species exists ? <eos>
 The Humpback was indigenous to Earth . Earth of the past . <eos>
 But we can not turn away ! Is there no alternative ? <eos>
 In progress Admiral . <eos>
 Uhura . Get me through to Starfleet Command . <eos>
 What s our target in time ? <eos>
 The late 20th Century . <eos>
 Surely you can be more specific . <eos>
 I have . <eos>
 Explain . <eos>
 Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels . <eos>
 . Simple logic . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Admiral may I ask you a question ? <eos>
 Ah . The giants . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Well for one thing you have not quite got the hang of it . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 And another thing . It s not always necessary to tell the truth . <eos>
 I cannot tell a lie . <eos>
 You do not have to lie . You could exaggerate . <eos>
 Exaggerate . <eos>
 You have done it before . Ca not you remember ? <eos>
 The hell I can not <eos>
 What else did you learn from your mind meld ? <eos>
 . I see . <eos>
 The tank will be finished by morning . <eos>
 That s cutting it closer than you know . What about team two ? <eos>
 No word since beam in . We can only wait for their call . <eos>
 Thank you Spock . <eos>
 No Admiral . But s the human thing to do . <eos>
 Right . Will you help us ? <eos>
 Admiral you must wait one damn minute . <eos>
 They did Admiral . <eos>
 Then . Where the hell are we ? <eos>
 No data Admiral . Computers are non functional . <eos>
 Weapons systems ? <eos>
 Continue on course . Chekov any signs of Federation escort ? <eos>
 Steady as she goes . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu we need breakaway speed ! <eos>
 Hang on sir . Nine point seven . point eight . Breakaway threshold . <eos>
 Steady ! Now Mr . Sulu ! <eos>
 . Aye sir . <eos>
 What s our condition ? <eos>
 Sir . Braking thrusters seem to have fired . <eos>
 Picture please . <eos>
 Go Mr . Sulu . <eos>
 Advise reaching 10000 . Steer three one zero . <eos>
 Three one zero aye ! <eos>
 Uhura scan for the whales . 401 megahertz ! <eos>
 Wing to cruise configuration . Full impulse power . <eos>
 Picture Uhura ! <eos>
 Ground cushion ! Keep the nose up if you can <eos>
 Aye sir ! <eos>
 Communications Systems ready . Communications Officer ready as she will ever be . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu ? <eos>
 Overlapping distress calls . Some from Starships . others . <eos>
 On screen ! <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 On speakers . <eos>
 283 degrees . 15 . 2 kilometers . <eos>
 Everyone remember where we parked . <eos>
 Nothing . I should never have left him . <eos>
 Uhura ! Where ! <eos>
 Mercy Hospital . <eos>
 Bearing 327 range 600 nautical . <eos>
 Put them on screen ! <eos>
 On screen . <eos>
 Sir . Estimating one nautical mile . <eos>
 Mr . Scott how soon ? <eos>
 Out of control and blind as a bat ! <eos>
 About 60 feet Admiral . <eos>
 That should be enough . Can you enclose it to hold water ? <eos>
 I suppose I can sir are you planning to take a swim ? <eos>
 Humpbacked people . <eos>
 Whales Scotty . 45 to 50 feet long about 40 tons a piece . <eos>
 Admiral how am I going to handle all that weight ? <eos>
 You will work it out Scotty . And remember two of them . <eos>
 Two ? <eos>
 It takes two to tango Mr . Scott . <eos>
 Give me a round figure Mr . Scott . <eos>
 Not good enough Scotty . You have got to do better ! <eos>
 Mr . Sulu ? <eos>
 Aye . But I have never beamed up 400 tons before . <eos>
 How long Scotty ? <eos>
 10 seconds Admiral 5 4 3 2 1 . <eos>
 Mr . Scott do not make jokes we are in danger of <eos>
 Full power sir . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu if you please . <eos>
 No power to the bay doors . <eos>
 The explosive override ? <eos>
 It s under water ! There s no way to reach it . <eos>
 Go on ahead . Close the hatch ! <eos>
 Admiral you will be trapped ! <eos>
 You will be in good hands here . <eos>
 Do you have the right to murder ? <eos>
 I demand to see the owners ! I demand <eos>
 Well that s different . <eos>
 If you will follow me Professor <eos>
 I will . Can my assistant come too ? <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 . Yes ? <eos>
 I notice you are still working with polymers . <eos>
 Sill ? What else would I be working with ? <eos>
 Just use the keyboard . <eos>
 The keyboard . How quaint . <eos>
 That s the ticket laddie . <eos>
 Hi . Huey 205 s not it ? <eos>
 Right on . You fly ? <eos>
 Oh here and there . I flew something similar in my Academy days . <eos>
 All right then this s old stuff to you . <eos>
 Yes of course . Do you have any message for your mother ? <eos>
 Tell her I feel fine . <eos>
 I do not like to leave questions unanswered . <eos>
 Then you must spend your life answering questions . <eos>
 There are days . <eos>
 You do not live up to your reputation as an offlander Picard . <eos>
 In defense of offlanders there are many more like me . <eos>
 For someone so young . <eos>
 I should warn you . I have always been attracted to older women . <eos>
 This way ! <eos>
 I thought it might begin the healing process . <eos>
 I am better . <eos>
 I understand . <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 My power cells continually re charge themselves . <eos>
 I can not imagine what it would be like to be a machine . <eos>
 Really . <eos>
 For one thing your legs are shorter than everyone else s . <eos>
 I play the violin . and my chess routines are quite advanced . <eos>
 No I mean . <eos>
 For what purpose ? <eos>
 Androids . do not have . fun . <eos>
 Why not . <eos>
 No one s ever asked me that before . <eos>
 Tournel will take you the rest of the way . <eos>
 No . I want to stay with you . <eos>
 It s safer there . I will join you shortly . <eos>
 Bye . <eos>
 Data does not breathe . <eos>
 Wo not he rust ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 If not for Data you would probably have been re located by now . <eos>
 Your Captain used to cut quite a rug . <eos>
 They should be quarantined before joining the ship s population . <eos>
 Yes . But look at this medscan . <eos>
 Is it safe to move her ? <eos>
 Safer than leaving her here . <eos>
 Captain Geordi . <eos>
 You are aboard the Enterprise . <eos>
 What s the last thing you remember Data . <eos>
 his nose should pant and his lip should curl . <eos>
 From the mission . <eos>
 How about a passive radiation scan ? <eos>
 It s clearly Federation in origin Captain . <eos>
 Just a few loose ends to tie up . <eos>
 Good . Let s begin to move these people out . <eos>
 Another forty three people reported taken sir . <eos>
 Will the structure hold if we blast through ? <eos>
 I believe it s safe sir . <eos>
 Picard s first officer . Do you really believe he will listen ? <eos>
 It s not over . <eos>
 It s over . <eos>
 . And now he s holding our people hostage down there . <eos>
 The Enterprise can be at your position in two days Admiral . <eos>
 This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines Admiral . <eos>
 Good luck . Dougherty out . <eos>
 Just a few loose ends to tie up . Dougherty out . <eos>
 Your Briar Patch turned out to be more hospitable than I expected . <eos>
 How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive . <eos>
 There s nothing further to be gained from this . <eos>
 But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge . <eos>
 If we could lure him away from the bridge . <eos>
 Deploy the collector . <eos>
 Thank you for reminding me . <eos>
 Are they . <eos>
 Do you have everything you need from command ? <eos>
 I do not believe it happened that way . <eos>
 Why would they fire at him without provocation ? <eos>
 His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions . <eos>
 So you are saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong . <eos>
 It s nothing . I am just tired . <eos>
 The manifold can not handle full impulse in the Patch Commander . <eos>
 You got me Commander . <eos>
 That s your expert opinion ? <eos>
 Options ? <eos>
 Eject the core . <eos>
 If it works you mean . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 On screen . <eos>
 Eject the core . <eos>
 It s our only way out of here Mister Nara . <eos>
 How long til they reach us ? <eos>
 Eighteen minutes . <eos>
 Remind me to lodge a protest . <eos>
 We are through running from these bastards . <eos>
 Blow out the ramscoop . Stand by full thrusters . <eos>
 Deck ten . <eos>
 Commander Riker . <eos>
 So where are the environmental concerns the Admiral was talking about ? <eos>
 We are not going anywhere . <eos>
 You Klingons never do anything small do you . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Go back to your quarters That s an order . <eos>
 Jean Luc Picard . my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi . <eos>
 Would you like something to eat ? <eos>
 No we are here to . rescue them . <eos>
 Ask them . <eos>
 I am afraid there s too much bitterness . on both sides . <eos>
 Slow to impulse . We are on our way . <eos>
 Yes . yes I . can hear you . <eos>
 We are trying to get to you sir . <eos>
 Worf what the hell are you doing here ? <eos>
 Transmit a wide band co variant signal . That will get his attention . <eos>
 He might be using the planet s rings to mask his approach . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Hmm ? Oh it s just something my mother used to . <eos>
 Beam him out ! <eos>
 Evasive maneuvers . heading one four zero mark three one . <eos>
 Transferring controls to manual . <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 Debrief them again . Have you been in a fight Commander ? <eos>
 No sir . It s a gorch . <eos>
 Gorch ? <eos>
 Picard to Crusher . <eos>
 No . We will be responsible for that Mister Worf . <eos>
 Accelerated hair growth s often experienced by Klingons during Jak tahla . <eos>
 We have to find shelter . <eos>
 Decloak the holo ship and engage a tractor beam Mister Worf . <eos>
 Can you beam him off ? <eos>
 Negative . He s established a security field around the control room . <eos>
 Is there any other way to disable the injector ? <eos>
 Say the greeting again . <eos>
 Yew cheen chef faw . emphasis on the cheen and the faw . <eos>
 Wine women and song . <eos>
 You should feel right at home with them . <eos>
 Hmm I should feel right at home with them . <eos>
 Good question . <eos>
 What . <eos>
 What you are doing to my neck . <eos>
 Was I doing something to your neck ? <eos>
 If that s true they are a dying race . <eos>
 But it s comfortable . <eos>
 Why do not you try sitting up ? <eos>
 Or you could try lying down . <eos>
 You are in quite a mood today . <eos>
 . I believe you . <eos>
 . I am not sleeping well . <eos>
 . Doctor Crusher has something that will take care of that . <eos>
 Augh ? <eos>
 I never kissed you with a beard before . <eos>
 And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up ? <eos>
 Activating injector assembly . <eos>
 Sir I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels . <eos>
 Your scanners must be malfunctioning . <eos>
 All ship functions are off line . <eos>
 Isolate one and re route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor . <eos>
 Good hunting . Hayes out . <eos>
 Mister Data set a pursuit course . Maximum warp . <eos>
 I look forward to reading your report . <eos>
 Montana ? Well that answers everything . Why the hell are we <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 It was an experience . Metal scalpels . needle and thread . <eos>
 You think they are still up there ? <eos>
 At least four hours . <eos>
 Intelligence . ambition . desire . I bring order to chaos . <eos>
 I do not know what you are referring to . <eos>
 That s because you have not been properly . stimulated yet . <eos>
 More lies . <eos>
 I am your creator now . <eos>
 Yes . but the Enterprise . my duty . <eos>
 . s to yourself . Do not make me hurt you again . <eos>
 Vulcan ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I believe so . <eos>
 Do it . <eos>
 Bring us about . Target Borg ship alpha four port side battery . <eos>
 Go to impulse . Where s the Borg ship ? <eos>
 Where s the Sphere ? <eos>
 Contact Starfleet Command . <eos>
 According to our astrometric readings . the year s 2063 . <eos>
 I am the Borg . <eos>
 Doctor Crusher has been . studying some advanced medical theories . <eos>
 I told you there s no <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Outside around back . Next to the water tank . <eos>
 Oh . just a little tinkering . How s he ? <eos>
 How serious s the damage ? <eos>
 There should be an access hatch nearby . <eos>
 I have the password right here . <eos>
 It could be the radiation Captain . Try from the surface . <eos>
 Always am . <eos>
 Phoenix to control . Initiating five minute countdown . mark . <eos>
 This s Picard . I have suspended the launch sequence . <eos>
 Then we will just have to assume it s still there . <eos>
 What s still there ? <eos>
 Altitude fifty kilometers . <eos>
 Entering the upper ionospere . <eos>
 There s a red light on the second intake valve . <eos>
 As they used to say . all systems are go . <eos>
 Picard to Enterprise . Picard to Enterprise do you read me ? <eos>
 We are crossing the threshold ! <eos>
 Active . <eos>
 Main bus . <eos>
 Ready . <eos>
 Initiate pre ignition sequence . <eos>
 Great name . French ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You do not sound French . <eos>
 Oh . here and there . You know how it is . <eos>
 California . San Francisco . <eos>
 Huh . <eos>
 Something wrong with that ? <eos>
 Not yet . <eos>
 The invasion plans . <eos>
 Invasion . <eos>
 Wrong answer Mister Picard . Try again . <eos>
 Yes he is . <eos>
 Thank God this plate was already fixed . <eos>
 I can try . <eos>
 You are lying . <eos>
 What makes you say that ? <eos>
 No . not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be . <eos>
 How did you know about that ? <eos>
 Do not flatter yourself . I take pictures of a lot of junk . <eos>
 Myself . and a few other friends of Zephram s . <eos>
 Friends from Cornell . <eos>
 Some . <eos>
 Lie . That s one . Keep going . <eos>
 Or . <eos>
 I have to . <eos>
 Where ? And do not tell me San Francisco . <eos>
 No . It s a lot further than that . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 On screen . <eos>
 Population . thirty five billion . All Borg . <eos>
 Western hemisphere . North American continent . <eos>
 Fire . <eos>
 Data set a course for that vortex . <eos>
 Steady as she goes . <eos>
 Fire ! <eos>
 Onscreen . <eos>
 Worf . torpedo . now ! <eos>
 We are still in Earth orbit . <eos>
 On screen . <eos>
 Life signs ? <eos>
 Ca not tell . Long range bio sensors are off line . <eos>
 I will keep in contact . You have the Bridge . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 Unless you would like to stay . <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room . <eos>
 They appear to be modifying the deflector dish . <eos>
 Computer thermal enhancement . <eos>
 They are converting the deflector dish into an antennae . <eos>
 Agreed . Options ? <eos>
 Destroy the deflector dish . <eos>
 The Borg will undoubtedly attack . Set phasers to rotating modulation . <eos>
 Just a little queasy . <eos>
 Understood ! <eos>
 We have lost Bridge control ! <eos>
 Emergency override ! <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 Where the hell are they going ? <eos>
 What are you suggesting ? <eos>
 Hold that thought . <eos>
 Riker here . <eos>
 Any sign of Data or the Borg themselves ? <eos>
 Something s very wrong Commander . We are falling back . <eos>
 Commander . we have a problem . <eos>
 Target . <eos>
 Admiral Donald . Bill . <eos>
 Mr . President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted . <eos>
 I am going too . They may need a doctor . <eos>
 The charge s murder . <eos>
 You may need assistance doctor . <eos>
 Fascinating . <eos>
 Vulcans sleep lying down . <eos>
 We DO sleep lying down . <eos>
 Thank you nurse . Jim she s ready ! Lock and load ! <eos>
 That s the question <eos>
 You heard the order Lieutenant . <eos>
 I wish I knew . Uhura ? <eos>
 Can you ? <eos>
 Jim I do not even know his anatomy . <eos>
 Chancellor Gorkon can you hear me ? Chancellor . <eos>
 What s the Brotherhood of Aliens ? <eos>
 We have been set up all along . <eos>
 We are not finished . <eos>
 Speak for yourself . One day . one night . <eos>
 Bones are you afraid of the future ? <eos>
 That was the general idea I intended to convey . <eos>
 I did not mean this future . <eos>
 Are we playing multiple choice ? <eos>
 Still think we are finished ? <eos>
 More than ever . <eos>
 Do not remind me . <eos>
 No way . You see this ? <eos>
 Spock s looking for us . <eos>
 Killed trying to escape it s a classic . <eos>
 Come on . <eos>
 To be <eos>
 And perhaps with a large step or two . Like a peace treaty . <eos>
 Captain shall we attempt to return fire ? <eos>
 In space no one can hear you sweat . <eos>
 We were until your torpedoes ! <eos>
 Then let me help ! <eos>
 Aside from a touch of arthritis I would say pretty good . <eos>
 Retire . <eos>
 Barely . <eos>
 Have you saved patients as barely alive as he was ? <eos>
 What are you in for if you do not mind me asking ? <eos>
 That s a comfort . <eos>
 I am not sure how to take that . <eos>
 Very much . <eos>
 You feign ignorance ? <eos>
 WHAT HAPPENED ? <eos>
 How can I trust <eos>
 Take them away . <eos>
 And what did they tell you ? <eos>
 That we fired two photon torpedoes . But <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Spoken by you ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Louder please . We cannot hear you . <eos>
 Those words WERE spoken by me . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 For insubordination . <eos>
 I have on occasion disobeyed orders . <eos>
 Well I <eos>
 You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor ? <eos>
 I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness . <eos>
 Captain Sulu . on assignment . anyone seen Spock ? <eos>
 Full diplomatic courtesy Mr . Chekov . <eos>
 I know what you mean . <eos>
 Uhura monitor ! <eos>
 Torpedo bay ! DID we fire those torpedoes ? <eos>
 Who else ? <eos>
 She s only a cog in the wheel no way she knows that . <eos>
 But if she s cloaked . <eos>
 Shields up . Battle stations . <eos>
 Aye sir thrusters . <eos>
 Second star to the right and straight on till morning . <eos>
 Shields up Captain ? <eos>
 You tell them Lieutenant . <eos>
 Now we go to Starfleet ? <eos>
 Now we expand our search to include uniforms . <eos>
 ALL uniforms ? <eos>
 Mr . Valtane any more data ? <eos>
 Onscreen . <eos>
 Do we report this sir ? <eos>
 Are you kidding ? Send to Starfleet Command . <eos>
 We will make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours . <eos>
 I shall look forward to it . <eos>
 We must do this again soon . <eos>
 Give a girl a chance Captain . <eos>
 They will be here . <eos>
 I like it here . <eos>
 Kill him ! He s the one ! <eos>
 Not me idiot HIM ! <eos>
 He s got it . <eos>
 And your coat . <eos>
 Fraid not . It would not fit him anyway . <eos>
 Krandog aranty . <eos>
 There s a reward for your death . <eos>
 We did not kill Gorkon . <eos>
 Do not you know ? Everyone on Rura Penthe s here for life . <eos>
 Except us . <eos>
 It IS possible . <eos>
 Where do we come in ? <eos>
 Energize . <eos>
 Captain if <eos>
 Stand DOWN Mr . Scott . All stop . That s an order . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 WHO ELSE . <eos>
 Thank you . Lieutenant one quarter impulse power . <eos>
 Plot a course for Kronos Lieutenant . <eos>
 Kronos sir ? <eos>
 I am still in the chair Lieutenant . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Come on Saavik you COULD knock <eos>
 We are almost at the rendezvous I thought you would want to know . <eos>
 Right <eos>
 I always wanted to try that . <eos>
 Only do not try putting words in my mouth . <eos>
 Right standard rudder Z plus five degrees . <eos>
 Captain . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Mr . Chekov anything unusual ? <eos>
 Uhura signal our surrender . <eos>
 I wo not allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises . <eos>
 You hear that ? <eos>
 Sulu ! <eos>
 Standing by Captain Kirk . <eos>
 You understand that by even talking to us you are violating regulations Captain . <eos>
 I am sorry Captain your message s breaking up . <eos>
 According to my information today . <eos>
 Thank you Captain Sulu . <eos>
 Do not mention it Captain Kirk . <eos>
 You have personally <eos>
 There s an old Vulcan proverb only Nixon could go to China . <eos>
 How could you vouch for me ? That s . . arrogant presumption <eos>
 I was asked by my father to open neg <eos>
 DON T TRUST THEM . DON T BELIEVE THEM <eos>
 They are dying . <eos>
 LET THEM DIE . <eos>
 The Chancellor s undoubtedly awaiting our signal . <eos>
 I am uncertain . <eos>
 Spock I am really tired . <eos>
 We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Curiously it appears to emanate from us . <eos>
 From Enterprise ? <eos>
 We have fired on the Chancellor s ship <eos>
 According to the data bank we HAVE twice . <eos>
 He was just about to explain the whole damn <eos>
 What peace conference ? <eos>
 The Commander s an old friend of yours . <eos>
 Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was . <eos>
 Spock you want to know something ? <eos>
 Not yet . Section 4236 . <eos>
 . s to trust him . <eos>
 Control this s Enterprise requesting permission to depart . <eos>
 This s the Starship Enterprise Captain James Kirk commanding . <eos>
 WE SURRENDER . <eos>
 This s Enterprise . We surrender . Repeat Enterprise surrenders <eos>
 Who else ? <eos>
 Nothing Captain . If they are here they are rigger for silent running . <eos>
 Faith . <eos>
 That the universe will unfold as it should . <eos>
 Such things have happened before sir . <eos>
 Not as yet sir . <eos>
 An omission . After that <eos>
 An error . <eos>
 I do not want to . <eos>
 I believe you . Please . <eos>
 Confirmed Captain ! <eos>
 We have been ordered to <eos>
 Apparently they are refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock sir . <eos>
 Signal Starfleet that . we have no idea location of Enterprise . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 You having hearing problems mister ? <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 Visual ! <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 . I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis . <eos>
 What s left of it . <eos>
 Mr . Scott you forget yourself . Please accompany me . <eos>
 Yet the data banks insist we fired twice . One computer s lying . <eos>
 A computer canna lie sir . <eos>
 I think not . <eos>
 You can check the torpedoes visually if you like <eos>
 We will have to check every one of them Mr . Scott . <eos>
 That could take hours ! <eos>
 Nevertheless . <eos>
 And if they are still in place ? <eos>
 Then someone forged a data bank entry . <eos>
 There was an enormous neutron energy surge . <eos>
 Not from us ! <eos>
 If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would have seen her ! <eos>
 Would they ? <eos>
 This one can . <eos>
 Aye aye sir . <eos>
 He s placing himself in a most awkward position . <eos>
 Maybe we should write them a letter ? <eos>
 But you did not join a conspiracy . <eos>
 Yes please continue . <eos>
 You are me . <eos>
 No . My name s Data . I am your brother . <eos>
 I am in a room with lights . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Is that your final answer ? <eos>
 No I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because you are dangerous . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship ? <eos>
 No . Can I move now ? <eos>
 No . I must deactivate you . <eos>
 For how long ? <eos>
 Indefinitely . <eos>
 How long s that ? <eos>
 Please Beverly this s hard enough . <eos>
 You are working late . <eos>
 He was a bit proud as I recall . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Can you describe it Deanna ? <eos>
 How far we have come . Let me know if you need anything . <eos>
 Soon then . I ll save the last dance for you . <eos>
 To happy endings . <eos>
 To new worlds . <eos>
 New worlds . Yes Data brave new worlds . <eos>
 Thank you Data . Let s see what she can do . <eos>
 Mister Worf accompany Data please . <eos>
 I can see that . <eos>
 Sorry sir . <eos>
 Aye sir . This way . <eos>
 It would appear so . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 We will find a way off together . Recommendations ? <eos>
 There s a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location . <eos>
 Port thrusters sir . Would you like me to drive ? <eos>
 Fire ! <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Yes sir . The Rift effects all long range communications . <eos>
 Commander Riker evasive maneuvers ! <eos>
 Full axis rotation to port ! Fire all ventral phasers ! <eos>
 Divert power and compensate . <eos>
 Deanna stand by . Open a channel . <eos>
 Negative . <eos>
 Sir . <eos>
 You are not looking at your self . You are looking at me . <eos>
 You do not look like me . <eos>
 This s not an appropriate time for a conversation . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I thought only me myself and Lore . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
  <eos>
 Why s it moving ? <eos>
 Like me it has been designed with modular power sources . <eos>
 The resemblance is . striking . <eos>
 I would like to pick you up now . May I do that ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 With pleasure Captain . <eos>
 Do you have a moment sir ? <eos>
 Of course sit down . <eos>
 And I you . <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 I know how he thinks . <eos>
 Counselor ? <eos>
 The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle me . <eos>
 Make it so . <eos>
 This s not about me anymore . <eos>

 All these innocent little creatures caged up like this ? <eos>

 Yes that s a particularly dangerous time . <eos>
 Are they moulting now ? <eos>
 Some of them are . <eos>
 How can you tell ? <eos>

 In case you are interested I was pushed into that fountain . <eos>
 Without any clothes on ? <eos>
 I am neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular . <eos>
 The truth s you were running around with a pretty wild crowd . <eos>
 Yes but . <eos>

 Yes . <eos>
 No . At least I did not until I came up here . <eos>
 So you did not go to school together . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 And you did not come up here to see her . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 You were lying . <eos>
 Yes I was lying . <eos>
 What did it say ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because it seemed stupid and foolish . <eos>
 Like jumping into a fountain in Rome ! <eos>
 I told you what happened in Rome ! <eos>
 Do you expect me to believe . <eos>
 I do not give a damn what you believe ! <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I think it could be fun . <eos>

 You will think me very bold sir . <eos>
 No tell me . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 No thank you . <eos>
 I will get it . <eos>
 Are you staying ? <eos>
 I think I should do not you ? <eos>
 It s an uprising . <eos>
 Of birds ? <eos>
 Certainly of birds . <eos>
 Not at first . Oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks . <eos>
 Well they will go along with anything . <eos>
 Why should we submit ourselves to their domination ? <eos>
 Hear hear ! <eos>
 You have nothing to lose but your feathers . <eos>
 Mmm ? <eos>
 It was like that yesterday . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 After the gulls attacked . <eos>
 I had not thought of that . And then the swifts came . <eos>
 I am frightened Mitch . <eos>
 No no . <eos>
 . everything I know . <eos>
 At Annie s house . She s all right . <eos>
 Do not let s take any chances . <eos>
 We have got to get Cathy . <eos>
 The bay does not . <eos>
 How long have they been gathering there ? <eos>
 I tried a little while ago . The phone s dead . <eos>
 Have we still got power ? <eos>
 Yes . I am tired Mitch . I am so very very tired . <eos>
 Inland . <eos>
 Santa Rosa ? <eos>
 Maybe . <eos>
 I thought they would have stopped by now . <eos>
 What time s it ? <eos>
 Almost two a . m . <eos>
 You must be exhausted . <eos>
 How about you ? <eos>
 Mitch . <eos>
 Wait here . Do not move . <eos>
 No . wait . Hold me . <eos>
 Hello Miss Daniels . <eos>
 What do you suppose it is ? <eos>
 Oh good ! Oh wonderful . <eos>
 I have no idea . <eos>
 What ? Oh yes certainly . <eos>
 Yes certainly . <eos>
 Do you have any lovebirds ? <eos>
 No not in the shop . But I can order them for you . <eos>
 How soon ? <eos>
 Well . well how soon would you want them ? <eos>
 What do you think they were after Miss . <eos>
 Daniels . I think they were after the children . <eos>
 For what purpose ? <eos>
 To . To kill them . <eos>
 Maybe ! Is it impossible ? <eos>
 No one ever said you were Mitch . <eos>
 Do you believe it s true Sebastian ? <eos>
 I like Bodega Bay as well as any man . If I thought . <eos>
 I am not sure but . <eos>
 If you do not even know what you want to do . <eos>
 With smoke . <eos>
 You and Mr . Sholes seem to be implying as much . <eos>
 Not if they are starting a war . <eos>
 They are incapable of organized warfare ! <eos>
 . probably contain more than a hundred billion birds ! <eos>
 Which gulls Mr . Sholes ? There are several varieties . <eos>
 The ones that have been raising the devil with my fishing boats . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Makes a lot more sense than . well an attack . <eos>
 Then let s go . Now ! <eos>
 I have not finished my drink . <eos>
 Put on your coats ! Do you want to get trapped here ? <eos>
 Take it easy lady . There s not a bird anywhere in sight . <eos>
 All right all right ! Hope you figure this out folks . <eos>
 I am very pleased to know you Master Fettes . <eos>
 Mr . Gray ? <eos>
 Of course it s the soul of the business the pay <eos>
 But can not you give me any idea ? <eos>
 Good morning . <eos>

 Of course I will . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>

 Gray has no need to threaten . You remember the trial ? <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 Where can I find him ? <eos>
 Come in boy come in . <eos>
 Excuse me . <eos>
 You are made for a doctor young man ! <eos>
 Well ? And are you not a good student ? <eos>
 But Richardson ? <eos>
 From the Municipal Council they are the bodies of paupers <eos>
 But you did promise . <eos>
 You see it s completely out of the question . <eos>
 Yes I suppose so . <eos>
 This girl was beautiful a wild lassie from the Highlands . <eos>
 Gray killed her . <eos>
 We can not be sure of that . <eos>
 Grave robbing s one thing this s murder . <eos>
 Pulse ? <eos>
 What do you mean Fettes ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Gray I am rid of him <eos>
 They will be thinking of that too . <eos>
 No room there . We will have to set it between us . <eos>
 It was a woman when we put her in . <eos>
 Hold that lamp up I must see her face . <eos>
 Not yet . <eos>
 You will be a good doctor . I know all about doctors . <eos>
 Well <eos>
 He was a nice horse . <eos>
 I want it <eos>
 I am not at the school anymore . I left last night . <eos>
 I wanted to see the white horse <eos>
 A doctor ? <eos>
 Do not call me that confounded name . <eos>
 Medicine ? That will keep . Sit down . <eos>
 You will not have it ? <eos>
 Why do not you do it then ? <eos>
 That s a good boy Toddy . <eos>
 Do not call me that confounded name I tell you . <eos>
 Hear him ? Did you ever see the lads play knife ? <eos>
 I have had some experience . <eos>
 The same . Look here Gray <eos>
 But what makes a thought start ? <eos>
 In the brain I tell you . I know . <eos>
 Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony Meg ? <eos>
 I have ordered nothing from you . <eos>
 This s a gift . <eos>
 I take no gifts from you . <eos>
 This s a gift you will not return . <eos>
 Get out of here ! <eos>
 Wait Toddy . That s not hospitable . I want to discuss business . <eos>
 We have never been friends . <eos>
 I have drunk enough tonight . <eos>
 Another little drop will never do you any harm . <eos>
 I would make you rich . <eos>
 I know <eos>
 Now that s very interesting Take a chair Joseph <eos>
 Only Brother . <eos>
 I know that you kill people to sell bodies . <eos>
 You are lately come to Scotland Joseph ? <eos>
 I come from Lisbon . <eos>
 I never heard that song . But what did they do ? <eos>
 Nearly a year . <eos>
 Any attacks of pain since ? <eos>
 Yes Doctor . <eos>
 Is her pain sporadic or constant ? <eos>
 How long ago ? <eos>
 Three years . <eos>
 She would if she could . <eos>
 Did it spoil me Meg my lass ? <eos>
 You can get out . <eos>
 I will get him . <eos>
 He must leave me alone . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 Where are they ? <eos>
 Can I get you something ? A glass of water ? A transfusion ? <eos>
 Where are they ? Last chance . <eos>
 Or what ? You will bleed all over my carpet ? <eos>
 You sent them . I had no choice . <eos>
 We wo not . <eos>
 Dream on . <eos>
 Down ? Wait do not tell me . <eos>
 I am thinking . that explains a lot . <eos>
 I was hoping you would find out . <eos>
 Yeah . I sure will . <eos>
 I believe they call it a connoisseur s club . Owned by DELT . <eos>
 I think we should get some support ? <eos>
 What ? Call the police ? <eos>
 I guess it s true . Guns do not kill people . <eos>
 Keep that thing away from me . <eos>
 Where the fuck did you come from ? <eos>
 I do not know you man . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 A job . Construction . Twelve an hour . <eos>
 AAAANK . That s not how we play the game . <eos>
 The scar . <eos>
 There s no scar . I am telling you . <eos>
 You are the guy killed Dutton . <eos>
 I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you . <eos>
 What happened to your leg there Officer ? Hunting accident ? <eos>
 Nobody . <eos>
 How can you die if you are already dead ? <eos>
 You are him . Corvis . <eos>
 I was talking about you . <eos>
 I know her friends . <eos>
 That locket you are holding . You have one just like it . <eos>
 Your father gave them to both of you . <eos>
 How do you know ? <eos>
 I know everything about your sister . I will prove it to you . <eos>
 Stay away from me ! Dad ! Dad ! <eos>
 I told you I knew your sister . <eos>
 You killed that cop Dutton . <eos>
 And another one . There . Erlich . Took a wrong turn . <eos>
 You killed Lauren ! You killed her ! <eos>
 No ! Why are you haunting me ? <eos>
 Because you need to understand . And you need . to be careful . <eos>
 Yeah I know . <eos>
 Yes I do I really do . <eos>
 I do not want to see ! <eos>
 So you are going to kill him ? <eos>
 Have to find him first . <eos>
 All I knew she was pulling away . It made me crazy . <eos>
 It s not . I can not take it . <eos>
 Erin . Who ? <eos>
 I do not know . I found him lying there . <eos>
 No matter what happens . you are innocent . I promise . <eos>
 Shut up . <eos>
 You know . <eos>
 I know the guy leaves a sign . <eos>
 Good for you . You do know something . <eos>
 Could say that . <eos>
 Christ . It was Corvis . Tommy Leonard was right . <eos>
 Sign of the dead come back to life . <eos>
 The dead can return given sufficient motivation . And Corvis has that . <eos>
 Doubt s a motherfucker . <eos>
 Give me a hand with this sack of shit . <eos>
 You two are majorly demented . Anyone ever tell you that ? <eos>
 I mean Lauren . <eos>
 You killed my daughter . <eos>
 Erin knows does not she ? <eos>
 Let s hope not . License and registration please . <eos>
 She s . sick . Actually she never had Mai Tais before . <eos>
 But you you have had them . <eos>
 Not tonight . Honest . <eos>
 I want you . to bend over . <eos>
 Look can I just call a cab ? <eos>
 What did I say ? <eos>
 Just hold on to me . <eos>
 Honey . I just can not . <eos>
 Stay in the car . I will only take a second . <eos>
 Erin . I know you think she s been talking to you . <eos>
 Watch out ! <eos>
 The cop who found the knife in Corvis s car . <eos>
 It still does not mean . <eos>
 He said he would prove it . <eos>
 Looks like you have them both on . <eos>
 It s not what you think . <eos>
 You killed her ! <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Stay away from me ! Stay away ! <eos>
 Erin . It was not supposed to happen . <eos>
 About you . <eos>
 About them . You have got to leave it alone . <eos>
 Do not call me that ! Do not call me anything ! <eos>
 I do not believe you . <eos>
 Please . Come inside . <eos>
 I am never going back in that house again . Get away . <eos>
 The whole city has stopped . People are running around like ants ! <eos>
 What a brilliant idea . I never would have thought of it . <eos>
 He will be there at 8 30 . <eos>
 That s good Hilda . I am glad . <eos>
 How can you be so sure ? Have you tested this theory ? <eos>
 That was my first question . <eos>
 You would have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting ? <eos>
 No not at all . <eos>
 I assure you such power exists . <eos>
 Would such a demonstration be possible before the meeting ? <eos>
 Yes of course . <eos>
 I would not want you to harm anybody or destroy anything . <eos>
 Hello darling . Good evening Mr . Carpenter . <eos>
 Boy we had a swell time . Did not we Mr . Carpenter ? <eos>
 Yeah sure . Mom do I have to go to school tomorrow ? <eos>
 Of course dear . <eos>
 Aw gee Mom I had plans to play with Mr . Carpenter . <eos>
 Okay . <eos>
 What do you mean dear ? <eos>
 I could not go to sleep Mom . I had to tell you ! <eos>
 Tell me what ? <eos>
 No I have not Mom . I promise you . I saw it ! <eos>
 Well not exactly . I gave him two dollars . <eos>
 Come on darling we are going up to bed . <eos>
 Yes dear . Come on now . Bobby your shoes are soaking ! <eos>
 Yeah the grass was kind of wet . <eos>
 No I am afraid not . <eos>
 Gee I do not know . The space man I guess . <eos>
 Sure . Right near where my mother works . <eos>
 Where s that ? <eos>
 I thought that was only for bombs . <eos>
 No . It s for a lot of other things too . <eos>
 You think it can go faster than an F 36 ? <eos>
 Yes I think so . <eos>
 Well there are several ways to reduce landing speed . You see the velocity <eos>
 I do not know Bobby . I am inclined to doubt it . <eos>
 Mr . Carpenter what does velocity mean ? <eos>
 Velocity s the time rate of change of position . <eos>
 Would not you like to meet him ? <eos>
 Well sure I would but Aw I will bet you would be scared . <eos>
 We can scare him more than he can scare us . <eos>
 It s a problem in celestial mechanics . <eos>
 Bet he s the only one in the world knows the answer . <eos>
 Sure . Did not you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery ? <eos>
 No I am afraid not . <eos>
 Mr . Carpenter you do not seem to know about anything . <eos>
 All right . <eos>
 No foolin ? Will you ? <eos>
 Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them ? <eos>
 Well sure but <eos>
 Why not Bobby ? <eos>
 She does not like me to steal from people . <eos>
 Mr . Brady s a cop . <eos>
 We will finish it tomorrow . Goodnight Bobby . <eos>
 Goodnight . <eos>
 Thanks Mr . Carpenter . <eos>
 I will say goodnight again . <eos>
 Yeah sure . It s a real Boy Scout flashlight . <eos>
 Their life expectancy s a hundred and thirty . <eos>
 How does he explain that ? <eos>
 You must have come a long way . <eos>
 About 250 million of your miles . <eos>
 From another planet . Let s just say that we are neighbors . <eos>
 I mean the reasons for my coming here . <eos>
 Perhaps you would rather discuss it personally with the President <eos>
 I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth . <eos>
 You know about the United Nations ? <eos>
 Thank you . Have you any news ? <eos>
 Your impatience s quite understandable . <eos>
 You still have not answered my question . <eos>
 A good insurance salesman would not give you time to think . <eos>
 You ready ? <eos>
 I will be in just a minute . <eos>
 The picture starts at eight fifty . <eos>
 I was talking to Mr . Carpenter . <eos>
 I hope Mr . Carpenter wo not think I am intruding . <eos>
 Is it real ? <eos>
 Looks real to me . <eos>
 Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight . <eos>
 You think it s all right for you to stay here ? <eos>
 Come on in . <eos>
 What about him ? <eos>
 How do you know ? <eos>
 You do not understand . You do not realize how important it is . <eos>
 Why not ? Somebody s got to get rid of him . <eos>
 I feel different right now . <eos>
 You wait and see . You are going to marry a big hero ! <eos>
 I am not going to marry anybody . <eos>
 I enjoyed every minute of it . <eos>
 Jittery s the word . <eos>
 He has his homework to keep him occupied . <eos>
 He s a fine boy Mrs . Benson . <eos>
 Naturally I think so . <eos>
 Goodnight Mr . Carpenter . <eos>
 Goodnight my dear . <eos>

 May I walk out with you ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>

 Where s the meeting going to be ? <eos>
 At the ship . <eos>
 Remember those words . <eos>
 I I thought you were <eos>
 I was . <eos>
 You mean he has the power of life and death ? <eos>
 No that s a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit . <eos>
 How long will I live ? That no one can say . <eos>
 No . That s all finished . <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>
 How did you get in here ? And what do you want ? <eos>
 We came to see Professor Barnhardt . <eos>
 There are no diamonds like this any place in the world . <eos>
 Would you like to sell it ? <eos>
 No no thanks . <eos>
 I would give you a very good price . <eos>
 It s really quite simple . The three body problem you know . <eos>

 They could be as curious about us as we are about them . <eos>
 Maybe . Maybe they want to take us alive . <eos>
 I could wear it longer but it s less trouble this way . <eos>
 My kid brother has one . You know why ? <eos>
 Yes . Fits better in a football helmet . <eos>

 That s the kind of a kid brother you would have ! <eos>
 How could it happen to everybody s watch together ? <eos>

 I think that gizmo s a machine from another planet . <eos>
 We better get word to the authorities and Look ! <eos>

 I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood . <eos>
 No . I thought you had them . <eos>
 Looks like the fishing was good . <eos>

 He left his passport in Curacao . It s being mailed to Panama . <eos>
 That s unfortunate . We will have to take him with us . <eos>
 Twice . <eos>
 Is that what you were trained to do ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Then what do you think he was trying to do . <eos>
 Let the blow drive the boat down wind . Neutralize our canvas . <eos>

 As you can see there s a lot to do . <eos>
 Indentured servitude s not what my son had in mind . <eos>
 Take good care of my son . <eos>

 It s a little late to call Admissions . <eos>
 Is it a little late to call the Chancellor ? <eos>
 Maybe . I do not know . <eos>
 Competence . <eos>
 What s to tell ? <eos>
 Plenty I am sure . But for what it s worth . <eos>
 So sensitive . <eos>
 Oh come on Tripp . Cut the kid some slack . <eos>
 Ye es ? <eos>
 I am afraid he s pretty worn out poor kid . <eos>
 So what s the problem ? <eos>
 There s no problem . Did I say there was a problem ? <eos>
 The Chancellor s here ? Now ? <eos>
 Evidently . Coming ! <eos>
 Find the jacket . <eos>
 Oh ! Huh . Exactly how do we do that ? <eos>
 First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car . <eos>

 Do not touch it . <eos>
 My guess Vernon Hardapple . <eos>
 The hood jumper ? <eos>
 That s my car motherfucker . <eos>
 Call it a hunch . <eos>
 I have an alternate version of the first chapter . <eos>
 Or Hemingway when Hadley lost all those stories . <eos>
 He was never able to reproduce them . <eos>
 In a sense . <eos>

 With Emily ? <eos>
 Are you there to not reconcile with her ? <eos>
 No . Sara you do not understand . <eos>

 No ! What gave you that idea ? <eos>
 So did Gene Tierney . She s in it too . <eos>
 Sounds like a good one . <eos>
 It s not bad . <eos>
 It does not matter . It only took me an hour to write . <eos>
 Really ? That s remarkable . <eos>
 A little . <eos>
 So what are you doing out here ? <eos>
 It s colder in there . <eos>

 Blocked . <eos>

 Just checking . <eos>
 James will know about George Sanders . <eos>

 Hannah are you telling me you do not know where James Leer lives ? <eos>
 Some apartment somewhere . But I have never seen it . <eos>
 That strikes me as odd . <eos>
 Oh . Well . I . <eos>

 Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in . <eos>
 Crabtree ? He does not even know James . <eos>

 Oh Grady . You are such a putz . <eos>

 Birds . <eos>
 There s a million birds here . <eos>
 In that birch tree s a nest . <eos>

 They are extremely aggressive birds . Plus their habits are rather filthy . <eos>
 The mother sure has her hands full . <eos>
 When I go bird watching . It s why I like coming here . <eos>
 It s just a city park . <eos>
 Their sound s quite musical . <eos>
 How does it sound ? <eos>
 It s hard to describe . <eos>
 Try . <eos>
 I can not . <eos>
 I bet you can . <eos>
 It s a bright sound . <eos>
 That was terrific . <eos>
 You should hear the bird . <eos>
 You live around here ? <eos>
 Not too far . Are you a bird watcher too ? <eos>
 Me ? Nah . I am more of a people watcher . <eos>
 Were you watching me ? <eos>
 Do you come here often ? <eos>
 My daddy likes me home before dark . <eos>

 That s okay . does not matter . <eos>
 Do you want me to sit on your lap ? <eos>

 Do you like it when he asks you ? <eos>
 Ms . Kramer . <eos>

 I said the job s okay . <eos>
 That s right you did . Have you made any friends there ? <eos>
 I am not running for Mr . Popularity . <eos>
 You seem a little hostile today . <eos>
 That was a joke . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I would like you to keep a journal . <eos>
 A diary ? <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 No way . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Diaries have sent too many guys to prison . <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 Ev i dence . <eos>
 Oh . It never crossed my mind . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It was just an idea . <eos>
 Bad idea . <eos>
 I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect . <eos>
 Reflect . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 You think reflection s good . <eos>
 It s very good indeed . <eos>
 How s that ? <eos>
 No fucking way . <eos>
 Then think about it . <eos>
 I am still thinking about it . <eos>
 I wish you would give it a try . <eos>
 It s okay . <eos>
 But you do not like coming here . Be honest Walter . <eos>
 Honest ? No . <eos>
 Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch ? <eos>
 Forget it . <eos>
 I do not feel anything . <eos>
 You have no feelings for your niece ? <eos>
 Have to talk about something . <eos>
 What are you afraid will happen ? <eos>
 I am not that crazy . <eos>
 Do you think you are crazy ? <eos>
 If I am not then what the hell am I doing here ? <eos>
 Why do you think you are here ? <eos>
 You know why . It s part of the parole deal . <eos>
 Is that what you are angry about ? <eos>
 Talking to you s like riding on a merry go round . <eos>
 We have a few more minutes . <eos>
 I mean when will I be normal . <eos>
 We have a lot of work to do . <eos>
 Will I ever be normal ? <eos>
 I could not say . <eos>
 You could not say . <eos>
 I am afraid not . <eos>
 Do you know what normal is ? <eos>
 I suppose it s however society defines it . <eos>
 How do you define it ? <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 Then how do you know if your patients are getting better ? <eos>
 They usually tell me . <eos>
 How do they know ? <eos>
 What s your idea of being normal ? <eos>
 What s your idea of being a Jew ? <eos>
 Then go see a therapist who will tell you you are normal ! <eos>
 Fuck you Rosen ! <eos>
 I know <eos>
 You do not know ! <eos>
 I know you are frustrated Walter but <eos>
 What did you think would happen ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 What did you want to happen ? <eos>
 I do not know ! <eos>
 Of course it is ! That s why I am telling you ! <eos>
 I want you to calm down . <eos>
 I want to talk about it now . <eos>
 We will talk about it more on Thursday . <eos>
 Remember when you asked me what my idea of normal was ? <eos>
 Go home Walter . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 Please do not do it again . <eos>
 I said I was sorry . <eos>
 I can not move my patients around to accommodate one person . <eos>
 You mean my problem ? <eos>
 If by problem you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes . <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 That s not a helpful answer . <eos>
 That s my answer . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I would like you to close your eyes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 To relax . <eos>
 I am relaxed . <eos>
 Close your eyes and let your mind be blank . <eos>
 Hey Rosen you going to hypnotize me ? <eos>
 In your mind Walter . Take your time . <eos>
 I see my sister . <eos>
 Not so fast . <eos>
 Sorry . Where s she ? <eos>
 In my bedroom sleeping . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>

 Where are you ? <eos>
 In my bed too . <eos>

 But roughly how old ? <eos>
 I am maybe about six . which would make her four . <eos>
 Just lying there . We are taking a nap . <eos>
 A nap ? <eos>
 Did you and your sister often take naps together ? <eos>
 I want you back in your chair ! Right now ! <eos>
 All right . <eos>
 I do not like nobody behind my back ! <eos>
 I am sorry . I should not have been there . <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 I am only asking questions . <eos>
 That s all . I just liked smelling her hair . <eos>
 You felt pleasure . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I was six years old ! <eos>
 I meant later . when you two took naps . <eos>
 All right . A small house . with small rooms . <eos>
 Time . <eos>
 How do you feel about that ? <eos>
 I feel . okay . <eos>
 Are you okay ? <eos>
 Yeah I am fucking fantastic . <eos>
 I am all right . <eos>
 It s fucking freezing out here . <eos>
 What picture ? <eos>
 I am talking about you . <eos>
 Me ? <eos>
 Yeah you . <eos>
 No weirder than a sharp young good looking woman working in a lumberyard . <eos>
 What s weird about that ? <eos>
 Most women would not choose it . <eos>
 Guess I am not like most women . <eos>
 I am just quiet . <eos>
 You do not hang out with the other guys . <eos>
 Neither do you . <eos>
 They are all assholes . <eos>
 I thought you were a dyke . <eos>
 What do you think ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 K through sixth . <eos>
 Does not it get noisy ? <eos>
 I like the noise . <eos>
 What about them ? <eos>
 They could eat you . <eos>
 Yeah they could . <eos>
 You are damaged . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 I get that impression . <eos>
 So . what s your dark secret ? <eos>
 Why do you want to know ? <eos>
 Do not you think I should know before we have sex ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Not tonight . <eos>
 You are still here . <eos>
 I did not say I did not enjoy it . <eos>
 Of course . Sorry . I am such a fucking asshole . <eos>
 No you are not . <eos>
 You think I have a problem ? <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 It s been a while since . <eos>
 Since you have had sex ? <eos>
 Maybe later . <eos>
 How about in the morning . <eos>
 The morning ? <eos>
 I thought I would stay the night . <eos>
 What for ? <eos>
 I suffer from insomnia . <eos>
 Is that all ? <eos>
 Hi . <eos>
 Because I like you . <eos>
 The worst ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 I molested little girls . <eos>
 Molested little girls ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Twelve years in prison s no joke . <eos>
 How many girls did you molest ? <eos>
 What did you do to them ? <eos>
 It s not what you think . <eos>
 How young ? <eos>
 Twelve years in prison ? <eos>
 I told you I am not easily shocked . <eos>
 You should be shocked . Or do you get off on this shit ? <eos>

 Get your kicks somewhere else . <eos>
 Hey I am not <eos>
 Depraved ? My mistake . <eos>
 Walter . <eos>

 My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave . <eos>
 Why young girls Walter ? <eos>
 Their power . They seduce me . <eos>
 They seduce you ? <eos>
 I was always the one seduced . <eos>
 You really believe that ? <eos>
 No . That s what I used to tell myself . <eos>
 And what do you tell yourself now ? <eos>
 Nothing . It s over . <eos>
 Bullshit . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Being here with me . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Most people say the odds are against me . <eos>
 What odds ? <eos>
 The percentages <eos>

 Maybe you should be . <eos>
 Live together . <eos>
 Move in with me . <eos>
 I think it s a fucking good idea . <eos>
 Just think about it . <eos>
 I have got problems . <eos>
 Who does not ? <eos>
 Most people do not have my kind of problems . <eos>
 Guess that makes you pretty special . <eos>
 That s not what I meant . <eos>
 Fine . <eos>
 What s it look like ? <eos>
 You are such an asshole . <eos>
 I am not scared . <eos>
 Prove it . <eos>
 Do what ? <eos>
 Sneak up behind me like that . <eos>

 Sounds like the name of a fish merluzzo basiluzzo . <eos>
 At the ruins . They are very ancient you know . <eos>
 Well what ? <eos>
 Have you decided ? <eos>
 All I said was that it sounds like a good idea . <eos>
 That s Patrizia s way of letting us know she s with us . <eos>
 More so than the shark ? <eos>
 There s no comparison . <eos>
 Then why do not we go up and see the ruins ? <eos>
 That seems to apply to you also . <eos>
 How should I be . arrogant ? <eos>
 But of course . arrogant haughty . Has not Anna ever told you ? <eos>
 Oh no . please . not here . It looks too dangerous . <eos>
 And why have not they left each other ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I am sorry about last night . Please forgive me . <eos>
 You are very fond of Anna are not you ? <eos>

 Yes yes yes yes . Right away . <eos>
 So you wonder why ? <eos>
 Okay . In a few minutes . <eos>

 Are not you going to change ? <eos>
 You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I am too sleepy . <eos>
 Good night . Tell me that you love me . <eos>
 I love you . <eos>
 Tell me once more . <eos>
 I do not love you . <eos>
 I deserve it . <eos>
 I would say he s pretty depraved . <eos>
 Oh no quite the contrary . He s really just a child . <eos>
 Have you ever been in love ? <eos>
 Not really . It s suffocating in here . Shall we go out ? <eos>
 I just can not leave without first searching those islands one by one . <eos>
 It was futile . We went all over . <eos>
 You say that just to flatter me . <eos>
 Do you consider that a compliment ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 But then why did you bother changing ? <eos>
 Quieter ? Oh yes of course . <eos>
 What do you mean by sensible ? <eos>
 It means being without money . <eos>
 I imagine he must be inside sleeping . <eos>
 More or less we are all afraid . Especially at night . <eos>
 To the shark . <eos>
 But for what reason should I come there ? <eos>
 But why all nudes ? <eos>
 I think all you have to do Giulia s to close the door . <eos>
 I detest comparisons made with oil . <eos>
 You must know your third grade geography book inside out . <eos>
 But why ? What if it starts to rain ? <eos>
 If it rains I will buy myself an umbrella . <eos>
 When one approaches fifty my dear he s affected only by the cold . <eos>
 Well we are still in Italy you know ! <eos>

 What s it ? <eos>
 Nothing nothing at all . I was just looking for Sandro . <eos>
 And you expect to find him in here ? Go and ask Claudia . <eos>
 Yes yes of course . <eos>
 Ask her . <eos>
 Here I am . <eos>
 And where do you find the models ? <eos>
 Oh there are as many as one wants . <eos>
 I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays . Did not you Claudia ? <eos>
 Why do not you try ? <eos>
 Me . Goffredo you are mad ! He s mad . <eos>
 But I want to paint you . You appeal to me more . <eos>
 I appeal to you more ? <eos>
 Yes she takes care of the garden . <eos>
 No not like this one . <eos>
 And why would not we have one like this ? <eos>
 Because this s a Chinese radio . <eos>
 Unfortunately no . <eos>
 Do not worry we have got everything . <eos>
 Another thing there s an old man who lives here on the island . <eos>
 I know I know . One thing at a time . <eos>
 Well . probably at the last stop which s Noto . <eos>
 Do not mention it . Pleased to be of service any time . <eos>

 Pardon me but why must I do you a favor ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Through someone else ? <eos>

 Why ? <eos>
 She would punish me . <eos>
 One of the other Sisters ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 Oh for Heaven s sake . <eos>
 I am there s too much flesh on me . <eos>
 Agnes . <eos>
 I am a blimp . <eos>
 Why does it matter whether you are fat or not . <eos>
 Because . <eos>
 . You need not worry about being attractive here . <eos>
 I do I have to be attractive to God . <eos>
 He loves you the way you are . <eos>
 No he does not . He hates fat people . <eos>
 Who told you this ? <eos>
 It s a sin to be fat . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Look at the statues they are thin . <eos>
 Agnes . <eos>
 But she watches . she listens . <eos>
 Nonsense I am your mother now and I want you to eat . <eos>

 Father Martineau but I do not see him as a candidate . <eos>
 Could there have been anyone else ? <eos>
 Obviously there was . <eos>

 Believe me I have done everything possible short of asking Agnes . <eos>
 Why have not you asked her ? <eos>
 Do not ask me those questions dear I am not the patient . <eos>
 I believe Agnes s different . <eos>
 From other nuns . Yes I . I have noticed . <eos>
 No . not in the eyes of the police . <eos>
 And in your eyes ? <eos>
 I have already told you what I thought . <eos>
 It s possible s not it ? <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 That possibility never occurred to you ? <eos>
 No one knew about Agnes pregnancy . No one . Not even Agnes . <eos>
 Shortly after she came to us . <eos>
 And you were not shocked ? <eos>
 I was appalled just as you are now . <eos>
 And what happened ? <eos>
 She stopped eating completely . <eos>
 About two years before . <eos>
 It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again . <eos>

 Because I did not know . <eos>
 Oh God . <eos>

 One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect . <eos>
 For the Church ? <eos>
 For Agnes . <eos>
 You think she s a saint ? <eos>
 She s been touched by God yes . <eos>
 Who s he ? <eos>
 Why must he be anybody ? <eos>

 Stop laughing I do not say it s the truth I am saying . <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 Do not be ridiculous . <eos>
 Well give me a reasonable explanation <eos>
 You will never find the answer for everything God did . <eos>
 I thought you did not believe in miracles today Mother ? <eos>
 Somebody told her . <eos>
 Why would I lie ? <eos>
 Who was that person Mother ? Was it you ? <eos>
 Where s she ? <eos>
 Has not she had enough ? <eos>
 I have a few more questions to ask her . <eos>
 My God but you are determined . <eos>
 Why do you insist upon pressing . <eos>
 Was it you ? <eos>
 Is it because she s a nun ? <eos>
 Did you know she was pregnant ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And you did not send her to a doctor . <eos>
 I did not guess until it was too late . <eos>
 For what ? An abortion ? <eos>
 Oh do not be ridiculous . <eos>
 Too late for what ? <eos>
 I do not know . too late to stop it . <eos>
 The baby ? <eos>
 The scandal . <eos>
 You went to the room to help with the birth . <eos>
 She did not want any help . <eos>
 You wanted that child out of the way . <eos>
 That s a lie . <eos>
 You hid the wastepaper basket in her room . <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 You tied the cord around its neck . <eos>
 I left it with her and I went for help . <eos>
 I doubt that s what she would say . <eos>
 Then she s a liar . <eos>

 Sandy scan the whole sky . <eos>
 Dell plot our location . <eos>
 Where the hell are we ? <eos>
 That s what I am going to do . <eos>

 Gravity ? <eos>
 Point eight six . We can walk on it . <eos>
 It s . basalt . Rock . <eos>
 Then take her down . <eos>
 Martin would you run me an atmospheric ? <eos>
 Receiving . <eos>
 Looks like a derelict . <eos>
 No you will follow me . <eos>
 But functioning . <eos>
 Chaz this s Dell . Can you come topside for a minute ? <eos>
 What s up ? <eos>
 Take a look . <eos>
 You want to try ? <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 No it s too small only room enough for one person . <eos>
 Can you see anything in the hole ? <eos>
 Yeah but this s hard work . Ca not talk now . <eos>
 Wretched . What happened to me ? <eos>
 Do not you remember ? <eos>
 Do not remember nothing . Ca not hardly remember my name . <eos>
 I do not know . I am getting these u CRAMPS u ! <eos>
 u OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD u ! <eos>
 I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin . <eos>
 A transmission ? <eos>
 A voice transmission . <eos>
 Play it for us please . <eos>
 Unknown . <eos>
 What ? u Why u ? <eos>
 I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise . <eos>
 It s none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man . <eos>
 I have a temporary sequence on the monitor <eos>
 Hold it I can not hear a damn thing ! <eos>
 Has the hull been breached ? <eos>
 Hard to say . <eos>
 Well get started . <eos>
 Right . Talk to you . <eos>
 Yeah ! <eos>
 How s it coming on the engines ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Not u they u . u he u . <eos>
 The computer s translated the alien signal and it s kind of alarming . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 It grows on you . <eos>
 You know what they make this stuff out of ? <eos>
 That way . <eos>
 Bulbs burned out nobody bothered to replace em . <eos>
 Dead . <eos>
 Dead ! <eos>
 Do not know Broussard got hurt somehow . <eos>
 Hurt ! How ? <eos>
 Is it alive ? <eos>
 What was that ? What the Christ was that ? <eos>
 The water will still recycle . <eos>
 Well . I am going to have to blow the engines out . <eos>
 And when will you be ready to do that ? <eos>
 Oh I am not near ready yet . <eos>
 Then why the hell are you sitting around here ? <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 Here let me try . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 The engines are fixed . <eos>
 Just hold us together till we are in space that s all ! <eos>
 I hope not . <eos>
 Poison gas . <eos>
 You just sealed it off it can not get to that section . <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 And be right back . <eos>
 u He s u the only one that knows that . <eos>
 How does he breathe ? <eos>
 Yeah but how ? His nose and mouth are blocked . <eos>
 It s eating a hole in the floor ! <eos>
 But this thing uses it for u blood u . <eos>
 Hell of a defense mechanism . You do not dare kill it . <eos>
 Is not there some way we can get it off him ? <eos>
 You can not tell that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits . <eos>
 We would be sitting ducks in the freezers . <eos>
 Boy that s terrific . <eos>
 Well how does it feel to be rich men ? <eos>
 It would not come . <eos>
 Ask him . <eos>
 Careful do not get under it ! <eos>
 I will come with you . <eos>
 Maybe it was not always dead . <eos>
 The door was closed . It must still be in here . <eos>
 How s Broussard ? <eos>
 He s running a fever . <eos>
 Still unconscious ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Can you do anything for him ? <eos>
 The machine will bring his temperature down . His vital functions are strong . <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 Got a better idea ? <eos>
 Oh my God . <eos>
 Does anybody know what happened ? <eos>
 It s time for drastic remedies . <eos>
 The flamethrower needs more fuel . <eos>
 Should we go outside and bring him in ? <eos>
 What we really need s some red meat in here for bait . <eos>
 Let me go first you stay behind me . <eos>
 I can not the acid will pour out ! <eos>
 I have completely lost their signal . <eos>
 Can you get them back ? <eos>
 I am trying . <eos>
 What do you mean no ? <eos>
 We are not going anywhere . <eos>
 How many ? <eos>
 Three blips ! They are coming this way ! <eos>
 Jay this s Cleave ! Meet me at the main air lock ! <eos>
 I guess I had it coming . Let s call it settled . <eos>
 What s it I can not tell anything <eos>
 I think it s fizzled out . <eos>
 Hey ! what about the film ? <eos>
 Listen had not somebody better check on Broussard ? <eos>
 It was horrible horrible . Like a chicken . <eos>
 We sure need this flamethrower . <eos>
 It s not going to work . <eos>
 Feast your eyes . <eos>
 Sandy can you home in on that beam ? <eos>
 What s the frequency ? <eos>
 Computer what s the frequency of the transmission ? <eos>
 You lead . <eos>
 My signal s fading . <eos>
 How far ? <eos>
 Who knows ? <eos>
 Ca not tell these weather conditions could erode anything fast . <eos>
 I could not make it out too much interference . <eos>
 Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes . <eos>
 Is it still coming up or s it hooked on something ? <eos>
 No it s coming . <eos>
 Can you see anything ? <eos>
 u Do not touch him watch it u ! <eos>
 Help me I am going to try to get it off . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Let s let the machine work on him . <eos>
 Yes thank heaven . <eos>
 Is it still dripping ? <eos>
 It appears to have healed itself . <eos>
 We are going into the freezers now . <eos>
 Maybe we could write it together . <eos>
 Room by room corridor by corridor . <eos>
 They are on the next level up . <eos>
 Let s get moving with this net . <eos>
 Close . <eos>
 Could be some kind of venom or poison . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 They never made it off the planet . The parasites won . <eos>
 Sandy contact traffic control . <eos>
 Computer you have signalled a priority three message . What s the message ? <eos>
 Well it s finally happened . <eos>
 No that s atmosphere . Cloud layer . <eos>
 Turn on navigation lights . <eos>
 Engine room what happened ? <eos>
 Sandy . how far are we from the source of the transmission ? <eos>
 Nontoxic . but unbreathable . Pressure ? <eos>
 Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter . <eos>
 Good ! Moisture content ? <eos>
 Zero . Dry as a bone . <eos>
 Any microorganisms ? <eos>
 Not a one . It s dead . <eos>
 Anything else ? <eos>
 Yeah rock particles . Dust . <eos>
 Found what ? <eos>
 I agree . This s the single most important discovery in history . <eos>
 But ? <eos>
 What killed it ? <eos>
 I do not even know what I am looking for . <eos>
 Still worried ? <eos>
 Oh well . you know me . <eos>
 Tell you what Martin . As soon as the engine s fixed <eos>
 Yeah we hear you ! We are coming back ! <eos>
 Thank Christ ! We lost you ! Listen there s been a new development <eos>
 We are coming up now open the outer lock door . <eos>
 Chaz what happened to Broussard ? <eos>

 Is that its mouth ? <eos>
 Up one kilometer Jay . <eos>
 Let s take her into an escape orbit . <eos>
 Food storage room ! <eos>
 We are coming ! <eos>
 It started crashing around right after we locked it in . <eos>
 Now what ? <eos>
 I guess we open the door and net it . <eos>
 Go ahead Jay . <eos>
 What do you think ? Now we go in . <eos>
 Let s be democratic . <eos>
 By eating our food supplies . <eos>
 What s that supposed to mean ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 . More spores coming . <eos>
 But the idea s good if we could just turn it around somehow . <eos>
 It s stable it does not hurt to drop it . <eos>
 What did it do to you ? <eos>
 Look . <eos>
 I will get you out of there . <eos>
 No . do not . <eos>
 But I can save you get you to the Autodoc ! <eos>
 No good . it s eaten too much of me . <eos>
 What can I do ? <eos>
 Kill me . <eos>
 The head s okay but I could sink a six pack . <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 It s nothing Doc . Just a . touch of indigestion . something . <eos>
 Do you want a tablet ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Well just keep looking . It s gotta be . whoa Jesus ! <eos>
 Is it dead ? <eos>

 It s alright it s cool . <eos>
 Is it still moving ? <eos>
 Couple more seconds ! <eos>

 Have you got an updated Lloyds Almanac to cross reff them through ? <eos>
 Done it already . Nothing matches . <eos>
 Just give them the facts . They can leap to their own conclusions . <eos>
 Get off an all bands emergency distress and put it on a repeater . <eos>
 Compensate ! <eos>
 Punch me in a solution for their delta vee . <eos>
 Looks like it . <eos>

 Blow those suckers Driscoll ! <eos>

 What s this ? Twenty Questions ? <eos>
 Just curious . There s a lot of talk goes around . <eos>

 It s not modesty . I just do not try to kid myself . <eos>
 A revolutionary approach to the Theater . However if I may a suggestion . <eos>
 Please do . <eos>
 I would love to ! Or should I pretend I am busy ? <eos>
 Eddie what ? <eos>
 I believe I will . <eos>
 Just some coffee . <eos>
 I am not surprised . After all that humble pie . <eos>
 Nothing of the kind . Karen and I had a nice talk . <eos>
 Just like that . <eos>
 Do you know Eve sometimes I think you keep things from me . <eos>
 It was not meant to be . <eos>
 D day . <eos>

 Paved with what then ? <eos>
 Stars . <eos>

 Lloyd and I . <eos>

 Lloyd Richards s commercially the most successful playwright in America <eos>
 You have no right to say such things ! <eos>
 and artistically the most promising ! Eve dear this s Addison . <eos>
 She does not know . <eos>
 We decided the night before last before we came up here . <eos>
 Was the setting properly romantic the lights on dimmers gypsy violins off stage ? <eos>
 Well say something anything ! Congratulations skol good work Eve ! <eos>
 I do not know what I take you for anything . <eos>
 Yes you did . You still do . <eos>
 Champion to champion . <eos>
 Everything . Because after tonight you will belong to me . <eos>
 I can not believe my ears . <eos>
 A dull cliche . <eos>
 Belong to you ? That sound medieval something out of an old melodrama . <eos>
 What of it ? <eos>
 Answer my question ! Were not you paid to get out of town ? <eos>
 Yes Addison . <eos>
 And you realize you agree how completely you belong to me ? <eos>
 Yes Addison . <eos>
 Take your nap now . And good luck for tonight . <eos>
 You can have one at Max s . <eos>
 I do not think I am going . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Because I do not want to . <eos>
 It s the same thing s not it ? <eos>
 Exactly . Here . Take it to the party instead of me . <eos>
 You are being childish . <eos>
 Because that s what they are . Go make him happy . <eos>
 Like I just swam the English Channel . Now what ? <eos>
 You next move it seems to me should be toward television . <eos>
 That s all television s my dear . Nothing but auditions . <eos>
 And too many of them are produced . <eos>
 Hear hear . <eos>
 Then you have heard too . <eos>
 I was there . An eyewitness . <eos>
 You were there ? At the play last night ? <eos>
 A happy coincidence . <eos>
 Margo ? Lunching in public ? <eos>
 We have that in common . <eos>
 Then you two must have a long talk <eos>
 Being violently ill to her tummy . <eos>
 Eve ! My understudy . <eos>
 Did not you know ? <eos>
 Of course I knew . <eos>
 It just slipped your mind . <eos>
 Frankly I do not remember . <eos>
 Just slipped your mind . <eos>
 In time she will be what you are . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 This s Eve Harrington . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Right here . A minute ago . <eos>
 That s nice . <eos>
 Geniuses do not need good luck . I do . <eos>
 Everything . everything s so funny . <eos>
 I am a junk yard . <eos>
 Real diamonds in a wig . The world we live in . <eos>
 Where s my coat ? <eos>
 Like a nylon lemon peel <eos>
 Byron could not have said it more graciously . here we go <eos>
 Eve . I would forgotten they grew that way . <eos>
 The lack of pretense that sort of strange directness and understanding <eos>
 Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant ? <eos>
 I told her . I sounded off . <eos>
 I understand they have got the Indians pretty well in hand . <eos>
 Bill . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 Do not get stuck on some glamour puss <eos>
 I will try . <eos>
 You are not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy <eos>
 Everybody can not be Gregory Peck . <eos>
 you are a setup for some gorgeous wide eyed young babe . <eos>
 How childish are you going to get before you quit it ? <eos>
 Am I going to lose you Bill ? Am I ? <eos>
 As of this moment you are six years old . <eos>
 Call me when you get in . <eos>
 Bill ? Have I gone crazy Bill ? <eos>
 You are my girl are not you ? <eos>
 That I am . <eos>
 Then you are crazy . <eos>
 When when are you coming back ? <eos>
 Sure ! Like the Western Union boys used to do . <eos>
 I get a party do not I ? <eos>
 Of course birthday and welcome home . who will I ask ? <eos>
 It s no secret I know all about the party Eve wrote me . <eos>
 She did . <eos>
 How s Eve ? Okay ? <eos>
 Okay . <eos>
 I love you . <eos>
 I will check with Eve . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I love you too . Good night darling <eos>
 See you . <eos>
 It wo not play . <eos>
 Cut it out . <eos>
 I thought you were going to be late <eos>
 When I am guest of honor ? <eos>
 I had no idea you were even here . <eos>
 It s a pretty rare quality these days . <eos>
 She s a girl of so many rare qualities . <eos>
 So she seems . <eos>
 Thirty minutes forty minutes ! What of it ? <eos>
 For instance you ! <eos>
 Nothing really . <eos>
 You know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural . <eos>
 What s all over ? <eos>
 The audition . <eos>
 You would not understand . How was Miss Caswell ? <eos>
 So full of meaning fire and music ! <eos>
 The kid . Junior . <eos>
 Gone . <eos>
 I must have frightened her away . <eos>
 I would not be surprised . Sometimes you frighten me . <eos>
 Poor little flower . Just dropped her petals and folded her tent . <eos>
 Do not mix your metaphors . <eos>
 I mix what I like . <eos>
 Okay . Mix . <eos>
 I am nothing but a body with a voice . No mind . <eos>
 What a body what a voice . <eos>
 The ex ship news reporter . No body no voice all mind ! <eos>
 The gong rang . The fight s over . Calm down . <eos>
 I will not calm down ! <eos>
 Do not calm down . <eos>
 You are being terribly tolerant are not you ? <eos>
 I am trying terribly hard . <eos>
 Paranoiac ! <eos>
 I have been aware of that for some time . <eos>
 Well I am . <eos>
 I will say . <eos>
 Do not be condescending . <eos>
 Come on get up . I will buy you a drink . <eos>
 The terms are too high . Unconditional surrender . <eos>
 Then what would be enough ? If we were married ? <eos>
 I would not want you to marry me just to prove something . <eos>
 That suddenly makes the whole thing believable . <eos>
 You were great . <eos>
 Glory Hallelujah . <eos>
 What would you like ? Texas ? <eos>
 Groom . <eos>
 Yes dear . <eos>
 You know what I am going to be ? <eos>
 A cowboy . <eos>
 A married lady . <eos>
 With the paper to prove it . <eos>
 Eve . Eve Harrington . <eos>
 I just wondered . <eos>
 Just wondered what ? <eos>
 Why . <eos>
 Why what ? <eos>
 Why you have to go out there . <eos>
 I do not have to . I want to . <eos>
 Is it the money ? <eos>
 Eighty percent of it will go for taxes . <eos>
 It s only one picture deal . <eos>
 So few come back . <eos>
 Yeah . They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards . <eos>
 Also Addison deWitt . <eos>
 Every day . <eos>
 You did not have to tell me . <eos>
 Of course not . <eos>
 Goodbye Mr . Sampson . <eos>
 I am talking about you . And what you want . <eos>
 So am I . <eos>
 What have I got to do with it ? <eos>
 Everything . <eos>
 The names I have been called . But never Svengali . Good luck . <eos>
 From what would I be running ? <eos>
 You are always after truth on the stage . What about off ? <eos>
 I am for it . <eos>
 When you told me that whatever I became it would be because of you <eos>
 Your make up s a little heavy . <eos>
 and for you . <eos>
 You are quite a girl . <eos>
 You think ? <eos>
 I am in love with Margo . Had not you heard ? <eos>
 You hear all kinds of things . <eos>
 No thanks Birdie . <eos>
 I know . She just keeps hearin her dead father play the banjo . <eos>
 But she just got here . <eos>
 A diamond collar gold sleeves you know picture people . <eos>
 I never played Fort Sumter . <eos>
 Buy some . <eos>
 The same size ? <eos>
 Of course ! <eos>
 Oh brother . <eos>
 Oh brother . <eos>
 Miss Coonan . <eos>
 Imagine . All this admiration in just one room . <eos>
 See you home . <eos>
 Something maybe grew a size bigger . <eos>
 I have not got a union . I am slave labor . <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 Hmm ? <eos>
 You do not like Eve do you ? <eos>
 Do you want an argument or an answer ? <eos>
 An answer . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Now you want an argument . <eos>
 She works hard . <eos>
 Night an day . <eos>
 She s loyal and efficient <eos>
 Like an agent with one client . <eos>
 She thinks only for me . . does not she ? <eos>
 Well . let s say she thinks only about you anyway . <eos>
 How do you mean that ? <eos>
 My back s open . Did the extra help get here ? <eos>
 That French ventriloquist taught you a lot did not he ? <eos>
 Do not be dense . The party . <eos>
 I s not dense . And he s been here twenty minutes . <eos>
 Well I certainly think it s odd he has not even come up . <eos>
 Miss Harrington . <eos>
 What are you doing here ? <eos>
 I I guess I fell asleep . <eos>
 That s all . <eos>
 What for ? <eos>
 You probably wo not believe me . <eos>
 Probably not . <eos>
 It was for my report . <eos>
 What report ? To whom ? <eos>
 That spilled drink s going to ruin your carper . <eos>
 I will just pick up the broken glass . <eos>
 Do not bother . <eos>
 Subway . <eos>
 How long does it take ? <eos>
 With changing and everything a little over an hour . <eos>
 You rest . I will get it . <eos>
 Why should you think I would not be ? <eos>
 Not at all . <eos>
 He s the best . <eos>
 Oh no . <eos>
 She s got to meet you <eos>
 Not at all . Margo this s Eve Harrington . <eos>
 My husband . <eos>
 Try . <eos>
 Well . <eos>
 It could not possibly interest you . <eos>
 I will be at the old stand tomorrow matinee <eos>
 Not just that way . As a friend . <eos>
 I would like that . <eos>
 Tell me Eve how are things with you ? Happy ? <eos>
 Karen . <eos>
 I think she would cheer . <eos>
 But Mr . Richards and Mr . Sampson <eos>
 They will do as they are told . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 You wo not forget it ? <eos>
 I wo not forget . <eos>
 I seem to be forever thanking you for something do not I ? <eos>
 But there must be some reason something I have done without knowing . <eos>
 Do not bother I can take it up myself . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all . <eos>
 They certainly do not waste much time . <eos>
 Nothing definite yet it s just to have lunch . <eos>
 I do not intend to be . <eos>
 Ca not we sit down ? Just for a minute . <eos>
 Oh but there is <eos>
 and easy or not I wo not believe a word . <eos>
 Why should not you ? Please sit down . <eos>
 I am not crying . <eos>
 an understudy s performance . <eos>
 He can help you . <eos>
 Something most important you can do . <eos>
 You talk just as Addison said you did . <eos>
 Over my dead body . <eos>
 Thank you Karen . <eos>
 How do you do Mr . Richards . <eos>
 Every performance ? Then am I safe in assuming you like it ? <eos>
 I would like anything Miss Channing played . <eos>
 Remembrance . <eos>
 I hope so Mr . Richards . Good night . <eos>
 Not with you in them . Not by Mr . Richards . <eos>
 I wo not be a minute . <eos>
 Well you have done so much . what s new ? <eos>
 The curtains . I made them myself . <eos>
 They are lovely . Are not they lovely Birdie ? <eos>
 Very becoming . It looks better on you than it did on me . <eos>
 I have got it . <eos>
 and those checks or whatever it s for the income tax man . <eos>
 Right here . <eos>
 Yes dear . You forgot all about it . <eos>
 I would not like . <eos>
 I had no idea you knew each other . <eos>
 She s just outside the door . <eos>
 The heave ho . <eos>
 Harrington . <eos>
 I am so sorry . Harrington . Wo not you sit down ? <eos>
 Roughly ten minutes . <eos>
 How far to the station ? <eos>
 Three or four miles . <eos>
 Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas ? <eos>
 None in sight there are not many along this back road . <eos>
 Not many car either not much chance of a lift . <eos>
 It seems to me that walking for most people s not very dangerous . <eos>
 It does not matter . <eos>
 I detest cheap sentiment . <eos>
 We have all seemed a little tense lately . <eos>
 What about Bill ? <eos>
 He s in love with you . <eos>
 Is not that what they always say ? <eos>
 Well . <eos>
 This . I can not tell you how sorry I am ! <eos>
 With tears . <eos>
 Very classy stuff lots of technique <eos>
 You will be there wo not you . <eos>
 Loud . <eos>
 In a minute . <eos>
 And again and again ! Two hours late for the audition to begin with <eos>
 That s on time for Margo . <eos>
 Then a childish heavy handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy <eos>
 It s just possible she did not . <eos>
 What is ? <eos>
 Just a little skid that s all . This road s like glass . <eos>
 Eve . <eos>
 Eve ? <eos>
 If we could cast it properly that is . <eos>
 Now you are quoting Addison . Or Eve . <eos>
 No I got the idea myself while she was talking to me . <eos>
 With gestures of course . <eos>
 It strikes me that Eve s disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious ! <eos>
 They would die without each other . <eos>
 Margo ! <eos>
 I have no possible interest in anything she would have to say . <eos>
 Nothing much . She apologized . <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr . Richards ? <eos>
 I doubt very much that you would like her in The Hairy Ape . <eos>
 . Among so many quiet qualities . <eos>
 Up in the room . <eos>
 Not exactly . Sometimes though I wish I understood you better . <eos>
 When you do let me in on it . <eos>
 I will . <eos>
 The play ? All right I guess . <eos>
 Cora . She s still a girl of twenty ? <eos>
 Twentyish . It s not important . <eos>
 Do not you think it s about time it became important ? <eos>
 How do you mean ? <eos>
 Do not be evasive . <eos>
 Margo you have not got any age . <eos>
 Miss Channing s ageless . Spoken like a press agent . <eos>
 I know what I am talking about after all they are my plays . <eos>
 Eve ? Eve my understudy ? But I had no idea . <eos>
 I thought you knew . She was put on over a week ago <eos>
 I am sure . <eos>
 She was a revelation . <eos>
 To you too ? <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 in this case apparently as trustworthy as the World Almanac ! <eos>
 I have no intention of having an accident ! <eos>
 It s not important whether you do . We are wearing long underwear . <eos>
 Thank you Lloyd . Godspeed . <eos>
 You know she probably means well after all . <eos>
 She s a louse . <eos>
 I mean really deeply angry . <eos>
 I do not think I could be . <eos>
 Well . I do not want to play Cora . <eos>
 We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills . <eos>
 Call what call ? <eos>
 It this Templeton 89970 ? Miss Margo Channing ? <eos>
 That s right but I do not understand <eos>
 Go ahead please . <eos>
 I just played it . <eos>
 Play it again . <eos>
 But that was the fourth straight time . <eos>
 Liebestraum . <eos>
 I s not gonna die . Not with a hit . <eos>
 When s the audition ? <eos>
 A couple of weeks . <eos>
 I tell you what . Why do not I read with her ? <eos>
 Would you ? <eos>
 Anything to help you out Max . <eos>
 This s real cooperation . I appreciate it . <eos>
 Give Eve Harrington job in you office . <eos>
 Margo I would not think of taking that girl away from you . <eos>
 Promise . <eos>
 I promise . <eos>

 Are you breaking the contract ? <eos>
 Answer my question ! <eos>
 Who am I to threaten ? I am a dying man . <eos>
 I did not hear you . <eos>
 I said I am a dying man ! <eos>
 Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill ! <eos>
 I sure could not hurt it could I ? <eos>

 Mitchell Stans Magruder Kalmbach <eos>

 Until a minute ago . <eos>
 What does that mean ? <eos>
 Another contractor . <eos>

 He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because he s trying to retire me . <eos>
 He wants to kill you ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 The nature of the business . You remove your competition . <eos>
 And you want to use me to get him ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Forget it ! <eos>
 We do not have a choice . <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 If it had not been for me you would be dead . <eos>

 Better than playing with yourself . <eos>
 He was killed . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 The same way everyone does the government the Agency . <eos>
 The C . I . A . <eos>
 More or less . <eos>
 How old were you ? <eos>
 They recruited me when I was in high school . <eos>
 Jesus why ? <eos>
 Languages . I was already fluent in nine languages . <eos>
 You were like a boy genius ? <eos>
 Some people said that . I never thought so . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 I was just different . <eos>
 You went from high school to the Agency ? <eos>
 No they did not . <eos>
 But you knew what they were training you for ? <eos>
 Of course . I was going to be James Bond . <eos>
 Ahhhh . <eos>
 Women ? No . not really . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Because you are a women . <eos>
 Why did you leave the Agency ? <eos>
 My first take ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because I want to know . <eos>
 No . Just the first one . <eos>
 After that ? <eos>
 They become complicated . messy . <eos>
 Did it ever bother you ? <eos>
 Did it ever bother James Bond ? <eos>
 That s fiction . <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 Several . <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 Where s it ? <eos>
 Mexico . <eos>
 Thinking . <eos>
 About ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>

 It helps me to focus . It centers me helps me think . <eos>
 Oh . What do you think about ? <eos>
 Work . The things I need to get done . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 But you have never figured out a way to win . <eos>

 Transmits and receives . <eos>
 Cheap as shit . <eos>
 Then we wait . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Five million apiece . You get on your plane I get on mine . <eos>
 Sounds pretty well figured out . <eos>
 I have been thinking about it for a long time . <eos>
 Except <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Except if he does not come out of the hotel . <eos>
 I told you he will . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You killed him here ? In this city outside that bank ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What happened ? <eos>
 No . I went back to the hotel . And waited . <eos>
 Ten years later here you are again . <eos>
 Yes . Here I am again . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I think I got one today . <eos>
 Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids . <eos>
 I hate bishops . They are useless . I like knights . <eos>
 They are worth less points . <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 I did not notice them . <eos>
 When I first saw them I thought they were married . <eos>
 How do you know they are not ? <eos>
 I went into their room this afternoon . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 It was no big deal . I saw them leave I went in . <eos>
 Jesus if someone had <eos>
 Nobody ever sees me . <eos>
 Why in the hell would you take that chance ? <eos>
 No ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 So I could watch the girl that lived under me . <eos>
 Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 That s a ridiculous move . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because I will take it . <eos>
 I am sure you will . <eos>
 Am I attractive ? <eos>
 Are you attracted to me ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Why ? I do not know . <eos>
 Is it a physical thing or a mental thing ? <eos>
 Both . <eos>
 I did not want to complicate the situation . <eos>
 Attraction s a complication ? <eos>
 It can be . <eos>
 It happened to you before ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Who was she ? <eos>
 Someone like me like you . A pro . <eos>
 What happened to her ? <eos>
 She was taken . <eos>
 Did you <eos>
 No . I tried to stop it . I could not . <eos>
 Was she the only one ? <eos>
 I am not sure that I care anymore . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 When did it start ? <eos>
 Honestly ? <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me . <eos>
 Maybe you should see a psychiatrist . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 That does not sound normal . <eos>
 I am not normal . <eos>
 Martin . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I waited another four minutes . <eos>
 Shit . <eos>
 Wait until he s on the stairs . <eos>

 I would love one . Whatever you are having . <eos>
 I think you are supposed to answer that question . <eos>
 I called because I just want . I need to talk . <eos>
 Honesty . <eos>
 Everyone regrets something . <eos>
 But when you finLsh a job afterwards do you think about them ? <eos>
 Sometimes . <eos>
 Do you think about their wives or their families ? <eos>
 All the time . <eos>
 Can you tell me about it ? <eos>
 Do you believe that ? <eos>
 Are you asking me if I believe in another life ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Anytime . <eos>

 Still fifty cents s not bad . <eos>
 An alternative literary venue ! <eos>
 I s not sure poetry will go down too well here . <eos>
 Maybe but someone s got to make a stand . <eos>
 Like Custer huh ? <eos>

 We could make a run for it ? <eos>
 No he was talking about girls I think . <eos>

 Just save me a little patch and I will do it later . <eos>
 But how did the wall get here ? <eos>
 Do not we have enough already ? <eos>
 It must be fair old size suppose it s empty ? <eos>
 And suppose a little old lady lives there ? <eos>
 No way it s sealed if she s in there she s dead . <eos>
 Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone . <eos>
 Why how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe ? <eos>
 Is it gone four thirty ? <eos>
 Yeah I will take some . <eos>
 Have you ever stolen anything ? <eos>
 Nope . <eos>
 Could you handle it if it was in a good cause ? <eos>
 Like helping a sick kid ? <eos>
 No for the Asylum . <eos>
 Close ! <eos>
 Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better . <eos>
 What s that five instead of ten years jail . <eos>
 They will never get us . <eos>
 It looks new they might miss one or two . <eos>
 We are going to need it all . <eos>
 Jesus Doug they will execute us ! <eos>
 Not yet we need a few lengths of scaffold . <eos>
 We do not speak Czech ! <eos>
 Am I late ? <eos>

 You should have said it was Bring A Bottle . <eos>

 I think they are getting worse . <eos>
 It s a wonder you sleep at all . <eos>
 Hardly a worry sir . <eos>
 I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile . <eos>
 She has an excellent mind . <eos>
 If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady I humbly apologize <eos>
 I wonder if she would go out with me . <eos>
 Apology hastily retracted . <eos>
 Ninety three including the sauna . <eos>

 The House of Pain . <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>

 What about Nomak ? <eos>
 Minutes . <eos>
 You do not have to hunt to do it . <eos>
 Fry em . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I do not think so . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because one of us s going to kill the other before this ends . <eos>
 Pain cuts the deepest s not that what you said ? <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 Not good . <eos>
 I want to see the sun rise . <eos>
 Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth . <eos>
 Did you think I would not ? <eos>
 Took you long enough . <eos>
 Sounds like a plan . <eos>
 What do you really think ? <eos>
 I am not giving you a choice old man . <eos>
 Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself . <eos>
 I will show you . <eos>
 Where the hell have you been ? <eos>
 Just out connecting a few dots . <eos>
 Why do not you ask your girlfriend ? <eos>
 Blood . <eos>
 Look I care about the humans who are dying not you got it ? <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 Thought you were dead . <eos>
 Seems like there s a lot of that going around these days . <eos>
 Not alone . <eos>
 I should think that would be obvious at this point . <eos>
 I do not know about this man <eos>
 Human ? <eos>
 He was here . Watching us . <eos>
 Nomak ? <eos>
 He wants us to know he s hunting us now . <eos>
 You are wasting your time Blade . The flechette s a dud . <eos>
 Getting your attention Paco . <eos>
 Ai not no thing but a chicken wing buttercup . <eos>
 You experimented on your own son ? <eos>
 Are you insane ? He will kill us both ! <eos>
 Maybe it s better that way . <eos>
 They have made contact with the Reapers . <eos>
 Any casualties ? <eos>
 Two so far . <eos>
 No . This s a dangerous game you are playing Damaskinos . <eos>
 Nobody to call in case of an emergency ? <eos>
 No Does that mean I can not be a donor ? <eos>
 Scud . <eos>
 Whatever What would you do to the Charger ? <eos>
 Look what s your problem ? <eos>
 Yeah but you did not have the Scudster working on it did you ? <eos>
 Nope . Back then we did not . <eos>
 So how long have you known Blade anyway ? <eos>
 Going on twenty years now . <eos>
 Blade does not talk about the old days much . <eos>
 Blade does not talk about anything much . What about you though ? <eos>
 After last night ? Dude I am a lover not a fighter . <eos>
 You little shit . When did they get to you ? <eos>
 Are we bringing home strays now ? <eos>

 You do not know that . <eos>
 What do you see here ? <eos>
 Graffiti <eos>

 The way they move they way they smell <eos>
 There are worse things than vampires out there . <eos>
 Like what ? <eos>
 Like me . <eos>
 Some kind of archive <eos>
 Nothing that wo not heal by dawn . <eos>
 Serum it s a human hemoglobin substitute . <eos>
 You get used to the darkness . <eos>
 Those are not real memories . No one has that kind of recall . <eos>
 Blade <eos>
 For your miracle cure ? <eos>
 Cancer . <eos>
 Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card . <eos>

 She s waiting in the conference room . <eos>
 The kids at school say she humped Mr . Marsh to death . <eos>
 Well that s kind of how I am right now . <eos>

 Everything you could not . <eos>

 They were in a car accident . <eos>

 I would appreciate a little space . Thank you . <eos>
 Do I hear a woman s voice ? <eos>
 Taking messages . <eos>
 That s all we need . Better let me drive . <eos>
 This s my conversation . I will say what I fucking please . <eos>
 Oh . Seems yours girlfriend s casting doubts on your expertise . <eos>
 I am not ! Fuck you ! Theo s a genius . <eos>
 I will explain later . I am sort of on hold . <eos>
 You could have made me lose my call . <eos>
 You could not hurt me . But it s the principle . <eos>
 Theo wants to talk again . <eos>
 Did you have to tell her my name ? <eos>
 This Mercedes of yours what s it look like ? <eos>
 Then whose s it ? <eos>
 You gotta just look the other way . <eos>
 You could have killed us . <eos>
 Why would I do that ? <eos>
 I am going to level with you officer . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 Any time you decide to let me in on it . <eos>
 Bear right till the fire road ends . It s not far . <eos>
 Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation ? <eos>
 With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you would not suffocate . <eos>
 You can tell she was really worried about me . <eos>
 Put those away . We can not have marks on his wrists . <eos>
 You never miss a trick . <eos>
 It s taken care of . <eos>
 That s your rep . <eos>
 That s what I deserve for listening in the first place . <eos>
 Just like they say no fucking self control . <eos>
 If you know that just back off . <eos>
 Shit . There s the hotel . You overshot the driveway . <eos>
 And stop with the directions . <eos>
 Make a U and go back . <eos>
 Satisfied Wiseass ? <eos>
 In any event whatever occurs you do not belt anybody . <eos>
 What do you keep making me out to be ? <eos>
 I am doing fine . Theo wants to deal . <eos>
 What am I supposed to do ? <eos>
 We will toss it when we make the blind curve . <eos>
 Allow me . <eos>
 There s a taxi stand here . I can meet you . <eos>
 I was worried about you . Both of you . <eos>
 I have been trying to get someone anyone . For hours . <eos>
 If this s some sales pitch I am not buying <eos>
 You do not understand . <eos>
 And what are you whispering for ? <eos>
 I can not talk any louder . They might hear . <eos>
 They are holding my husband downstairs . <eos>
 Sure . And they left you upstairs to make phone calls ? <eos>
 You are the one who s not to be believed . <eos>
 My name s <eos>
 I do not want to know <eos>
 My name s Lenore Oberfeld . <eos>
 Do not expect me to tell you who I am . <eos>
 I realize you do not want to be involved . <eos>
 Oh wo not I ? <eos>
 Because you know you will be killing us . <eos>
 Do not lay this on me ! <eos>
 Then hang up ! Do it ! <eos>
 No nothing . <eos>
 One of them u is u a cop . <eos>
 What makes you say that ? <eos>
 Then they took the Mercedes away with his body in it . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 Shit ! <eos>
 They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her . <eos>
 They do not know you . They wo not listen . <eos>
 Forget who I am . Where s this school located ? <eos>
 26th off Wilshire . <eos>
 Even if I got there first she would not go with me . <eos>
 She would if she heard my voice on the phone . <eos>
 Just hang on . I have got a life of my own . <eos>
 Another minute . <eos>
 What about the others ? <eos>
 I kind of dropped them off . They were getting on my nerves . <eos>
 What are you doing now ? <eos>
 Tell me what she looks like . <eos>
 How much time do you have left on it ? <eos>
 I do not know . 80 or 90 minutes tops . <eos>
 Hey drop it okay ? <eos>
 I did not mean to open up any old wounds . <eos>
 Well you did . <eos>
 Sometimes I paint . <eos>
 Our house always needs touching up . <eos>
 Pictures . <eos>
 I did not mean to insult you . You are an artist . <eos>
 They say my work s somewhat derivative . <eos>
 Lady you do not have to keep up a running commentary . <eos>
 A price on everything . <eos>
 I was not always like that . I do not think I was . <eos>
 I am about ten blocks from the school . <eos>
 You are breaking up . I can not hear you . Theo ? <eos>
 I am making my turn . I see the school up ahead . <eos>
 I can hear you again clearly . <eos>
 That s not her . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I have got to ask somebody . <eos>
 She s gone <eos>
 Do not say anything . Do not alarm them . Just go ! <eos>
 I am trying to . <eos>
 I should have put them out of the car and come sooner ! <eos>
 The one in Brentwood . <eos>
 What bank ? <eos>
 The City National on San Vincente . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 Black Mercedes 600S . <eos>
 Do not say that . <eos>
 Do you know what s in that box ? <eos>
 It s not hard to do . I do it all the time . <eos>
 I am pretty good at signatures myself . <eos>
 To hide it from the I . R . S . <eos>
 How come everybody turns out to be a crook ? <eos>
 Do not talk . Do not talk ! <eos>
 What s going on ? <eos>
 But I guess we have not really met have we ? <eos>
 Because you are probably the last person I will ever talk to . <eos>
 You can not give up . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Did you hear that click ? <eos>
 Yes I think so . Another crossed line ? <eos>
 Or somebody else there s listening in <eos>
 Downstairs . There must be an extension . Oh my God <eos>
 Lucky for them they did not . <eos>
 What did you do ? <eos>
 Are you okay ? <eos>
 They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles . <eos>
 That s coming off . How about the girl ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Put the man back on . <eos>
 Do not start thinking about it . Is the tape off ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Can you walk ? <eos>
 Yes . But I want Rachel to come with me . <eos>
 Just start walking . Come on . Walk to me . <eos>
 Shit . I am sorry . <eos>
 Include me in that . <eos>
 Why did not you just shoot them ? <eos>
 They put their hands all over me . <eos>
 Why are you telling him that . Are you crazy ? <eos>
 There s not any such person . <eos>
 Whose money s this ? <eos>
 Jack Oberfeld in person . Did you kill him ? <eos>
 Damned if I know . <eos>
 Plus they will remember you going after his daughter at school . <eos>
 You timed that beautifully . <eos>
 They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday . <eos>
 And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop <eos>
 I thought it was inspired . <eos>
 There was u no u cop involved . Oh shit ! Fuck ! <eos>
 Why pick me to be your mark ? <eos>
 Nobody s easier to con than a con man . <eos>
 You knew about me . <eos>
 L . A . P . D . <eos>
 Shit . You could not be in much worse shape . <eos>
 What s that supposed to me ? <eos>
 Naturally you did not learn your lesson . <eos>
 I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims . <eos>
 You could have hit me . <eos>
 259 7881 . <eos>
 Dial him up . We need him to run interference . <eos>
 Ask them . <eos>
 That s why we are turning off onto a fire road . <eos>
 Some people fall apart in a pinch . But you shine . <eos>
 The money Nels . ? <eos>
 Sooner or later you will learn to trust me . <eos>
 How about Later ? <eos>
 The cop in the trunk he could still be alive . <eos>
 That s a reasonable possibility . <eos>
 He might have heard everything we said in the car . <eos>
 What s your point ? <eos>
 We can not leave him to repeat anything . <eos>
 Which one of us s elected to do the deed ? <eos>
 You are the man with the gun . <eos>
 Naturally . <eos>
 Naturally . <eos>
 Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us . <eos>
 Only one way to find out . <eos>
 That s how it s going to be . <eos>
 He let the fucking cop out but he wo not <eos>
 Took preparation . <eos>
 Exactly who was this Oberfeld ? <eos>
 Take your hand out of there . Slowly . <eos>
 It s going to be some fucking snowstorm . <eos>
 Pull over ! Pull over someplace . <eos>
 I do not want it . <eos>
 I told you . sooner or later you would have to trust me . <eos>
 Who s this ? <eos>
 You must not hang up . <eos>
 Did not we play this scene before ? <eos>
 Fine . I want half . Plus the release of the family . <eos>
 Whatever you say . <eos>
 You are up on your details are not you ? <eos>
 It s a nice day . How about the beach ? <eos>
 Pass . <eos>
 It should take me twenty minutes . Where are you coming from ? <eos>
 We can be there . <eos>
 There s no loyalty at the expense of my own ass . <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot . <eos>
 You are getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular . <eos>
 I wish it had never been invented . <eos>
 We do not see you . <eos>
 Fucking A it is ! Any argument and I am out of here . <eos>
 Just relax . <eos>
 I do not need to relax . The woman . Put her on . <eos>
 You will see her . <eos>
 I still do not see you . <eos>
 You will still have the girl and the husband . <eos>
 And not a nickel . <eos>
 I wo not let em . <eos>
 She s yours . What are we waiting on ? <eos>
 I am backing up . <eos>
 Do not worry . <eos>
 Put the girl on . <eos>
 Better reassure him . <eos>
 Call me Nels . <eos>
 And if you ditch us we get zilch . <eos>
 I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego . <eos>
 You could not be calling at a worse time Nels . <eos>
 Nels ! Guess who ? A friendly voice from beyond the grave . <eos>
 Who s this ? <eos>
 I thought you would know me by now . <eos>
 What does it take to kill you ? <eos>
 I suppose you are in your taxi ? <eos>
 Why would she want me to think you were on ice ? <eos>
 My compensation ! Somebody still owes me big time ! <eos>
 You could always disappear with what s already in your backpack . <eos>
 Take the 405 south . <eos>
 Five minutes . <eos>
 Where do I turn ? <eos>
 We are gonna get there first . <eos>
 How do you know ? <eos>
 Believe me . They could not be busier at the moment . <eos>
 I have got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards . <eos>
 Where s the backpack ? <eos>
 Stay put ! I know my way around . <eos>
 Them . They wo not be expecting us . <eos>
 Only you u do not u have a flat . <eos>
 Seems not . <eos>
 If you were not going for a spare what were you doing ? <eos>
 Something was rattling around . Some loose tools . <eos>
 Mind if I have a look ? <eos>
 Let me talk to the lady again . <eos>
 There s no lady here . <eos>
 You have got a u phone u ? <eos>

 So who s he ? <eos>
 He s what she should run a mile from . <eos>
 Then why does not she ? <eos>
 Who knows the secrets of the human heart . <eos>

 When a girl runs out like that she generally wants to be followed . <eos>
 She s not a girl Col <eos>
 Whatever you say . <eos>

 A real gentleman . <eos>

 Maybe . <eos>

 I do not back down . <eos>
 The fact that I am right about your buckling ? <eos>
 I am going to miss the game . <eos>
 Because you buckled . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>

 She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died . <eos>
 I am not taking you to this funeral . <eos>

 I can not close the store . <eos>
 You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof ! <eos>
 Twenty two same as us . <eos>
 An embolism in a pool . <eos>
 An embarrassing way to die . <eos>
 That s nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died . <eos>
 How would he die ? <eos>
 Broke his neck . <eos>
 That s embarrassing ? <eos>
 He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick . <eos>
 Bible truth . <eos>
 Stop it . <eos>

 I should shit or get off the pot . <eos>
 Yeah you should shit or get off the pot . <eos>
 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 It s the same thing with Veronica . <eos>
 Leave her out of this . <eos>
 Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement . <eos>
 Jesus H . Christ I can not ! <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 Oh please ! I am surprised I did not kill you . <eos>
 Why do you say that ? <eos>
 Why do I say that ? Randal . forget it . <eos>
 No really . What did I do that was so wrong ? <eos>
 What time did you get to work today ? <eos>

 Unless you are out renting videos at other video stores . <eos>
 Hermaphrodites ! I rented it so we could watch it together ! <eos>

 Pay the good man . Do not you close soon ? <eos>
 A half hour . <eos>
 And these are not my drugs I just sell them . <eos>
 The difference s you exploit a weakness . <eos>
 What s that mean ? <eos>
 You sell to people that can not stay away from an addiction . <eos>
 All right . How much s Pepsi here ? <eos>
 A dollar sixty nine plus tax . <eos>
 At Food City it s ninety nine cents plus tax . <eos>
 So . <eos>
 Hey man what happened with that old guy ? <eos>
 He died in the bathroom . <eos>

 I said go ahead . <eos>
 No I mean the ones there . Behind the counter . <eos>
 I hate this fucking place . <eos>
 Then quit . You should be going to school anyway . <eos>
 Please Veronica . Last thing I need s a lecture at this point . <eos>
 All I am saying s that if you are unhappy you should leave . <eos>
 I am not even supposed to be here today ! <eos>
 Do not you have a hockey game at two ? <eos>
 Somebody jammed the locks with gum . <eos>
 You are kidding . <eos>

 How do you figure ? <eos>
 Now making a woman cum . therein lies a challenge . <eos>
 Oh you think so ? <eos>
 Something wrong ? <eos>

 It was not directed at you . I was making a broad generalization . <eos>

 I am sorry things went so wrong today . <eos>
 It s not your fault . <eos>
 It s three in the morning . Not much else to do . <eos>
 Stick around and find out . <eos>
 Vincent Bastaldi s in jail . <eos>

 How s the arm ? Still sore ? <eos>
 Much better . You have been gone so long . <eos>
 Li Mu Bai s coming to stay the night . <eos>
 I will go and make up his room ! <eos>
 I did not have the heart . <eos>
 Well Li Mu Bai can do it . <eos>
 Wait ! I am a friend ! <eos>
 Why were you spying on the Yus ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Then leave her to me . <eos>
 What s it to you ? <eos>
 Then tell me where Jade Fox is . <eos>
 On guard ! <eos>
 Real sharpness comes without effort . <eos>
 I have always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan s secrets . <eos>
 And if I use them to kill you ? <eos>
 What s it to you ? <eos>
 Tell me who s your master ? <eos>
 Let s go ! <eos>
 You are already a thief . <eos>
 Yes you do ! You are still my disciple . <eos>
 Long . <eos>
 Do not bother . <eos>
 You do not seem to understand . <eos>
 So what if I do not ? <eos>
 He s my defeated foe ! <eos>
 I heard you met Shu Lien today . <eos>
 Do you know her ? <eos>
 Do not invite danger into your father s house . <eos>
 Autumn s coming . I will shut the windows for you . <eos>
 I have a guest . <eos>
 You are a sword fighter too ? <eos>
 But you are just like the characters in the stories . <eos>
 What do you think ? <eos>
 No ! You could not roam around freely if you were . <eos>
 You are probably right . <eos>
 How so ? <eos>
 I am bored . <eos>
 I will write your name . Just for fun . <eos>
 Maybe it is . I would not know . <eos>
 About you and Li Mu Bai ? <eos>
 Yes . Did you know I was once engaged to be married ? <eos>
 No really ? <eos>
 Then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage . <eos>
 Yes from the West . He went undercover and and followed her here <eos>
 I am just borrowing some clean clothes . I am not staying . <eos>
 I will give them to you . <eos>
 I was just passing by and wondered how you were . <eos>
 Go back to them first . Then you can decide about Lo . <eos>
 You know about Lo ? <eos>
 Li Mu Bai has made arrangements . He sent him to Wudan Mountain . <eos>
 You are working together to set me up ! I am leaving ! <eos>
 Come and get it if you can . <eos>
 Without the Green Destiny you are nothing . <eos>
 Not another lecture ! On guard ! <eos>
 Let s end this here . <eos>
 Only the sword will settle this . <eos>
 What I have always wanted to teach you . <eos>
 Kneel ! <eos>
 Never ! <eos>
 Then you have no use for the sword . <eos>
 Jen ! <eos>
 Give it back ! <eos>
 You coward ! <eos>
 By the way I am a real Manchurian . <eos>
 I do not take orders from anyone . <eos>
 Give it back . <eos>
 It s trouble for me . <eos>

 Jen . <eos>
 Do not ever come back . <eos>
 A faithful heart makes wishes come true . <eos>
 Make a wish Lo . <eos>

 Good . And how are you ? <eos>
 Fine . <eos>
 Why ? You are a Wudan fighter . Training s everything . <eos>
 Something I can not let go of . You are leaving soon ? <eos>
 We are preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking . <eos>
 Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me . <eos>
 I am . He has always been our greatest protector . <eos>
 It s time for me to leave it behind . <eos>
 So what will you do now ? <eos>
 But something s going on at the Yu household . <eos>
 What have you discovered ? <eos>
 You always suspected she would fled to the West . <eos>
 I did not think she would dare come back to Peking ! <eos>
 Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu ? <eos>
 So I shall avenge my master s death after all . <eos>
 No not yet . <eos>
 But your men are watching over Yu s compund ? <eos>
 I do not know it was stolen until I got here . <eos>
 Then why did you come ? <eos>
 Well we had talked . <eos>
 She needs direction . and training . <eos>
 Just be patient with me Shu Lien . <eos>
 What about you ? <eos>
 I will look around and catch up later . <eos>
 Jade Fox drugged her . How did you get here ? <eos>
 We followed Jade Fox . <eos>
 Shu Lien . <eos>
 Save your strength . <eos>
 My life s departing . I have only one breath left . <eos>
 No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking . <eos>
 A murderer ? <eos>
 I doubt it . This thief . it very unusual . <eos>
 We must avenge mother ! <eos>
 Father ! <eos>
 What does it say ? <eos>
 Yes though I doubt he s involved in this . <eos>
 But the sword could be in his compound . <eos>
 The best way to trap a fox s through her cubs . <eos>

 Are you coming to see us . Miss Callahan ? <eos>
 No darling I had not intended to . <eos>
 I live right here . <eos>
 Maybe I will drop in and see your Mommy . <eos>
 You will see it when it s all lit and ready for you . <eos>
 Yes daddy . <eos>
 Did you mail then ? <eos>
 Yes I did . <eos>
 Where did you mail them ? <eos>
 I will show you . <eos>
 Yes daddy . <eos>
 Certain wishes do . <eos>
 It was on account of the birthday party . <eos>
 Why did not you run after them ? <eos>
 It s true . <eos>
 And who did the voice belong to ? <eos>
 It was just a voice . <eos>
 Let me be the judge of that . <eos>
 Voices from an old dark house ! <eos>
 This one says To Mother from Amy . <eos>
 And this one s for Mrs . Farren . <eos>
 Yes Amy ? <eos>
 Why daddy you know my friend too ! <eos>
 Because she s my friend . <eos>
 She s there whenever I call her ! <eos>
 Where Amy ? Where do you see her ? <eos>
 Do not you see her ? Right there under the tree . <eos>
 She s upstairs . . the lady who lives up there . <eos>
 Yes darling . <eos>
 I do not know yet . <eos>
 My goodness do not you open your presents until Christmas morning ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 We open ours on Christmas Eve . That s considered proper . <eos>
 Well I guess we are not a very proper family . <eos>
 You called me by my name . <eos>
 Irena . But who are you ? <eos>
 I am your friend . <eos>
 I have wanted a friend . <eos>
 I have wanted a friend too . I have been lonely . <eos>
 But where do you come from ? <eos>
 You would not understand . I come from great darkness and deep peace <eos>
 But where s that ? <eos>
 I can not tell you . <eos>
 Will you be friend for always ? <eos>
 For as long as you will let me . <eos>
 I shall want you for always . <eos>
 For always then . Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me <eos>
 Not even Daddy . or Mommy ? <eos>
 Whenever you want . <eos>
 I will just never learn arithmetic . <eos>
 But you must ! <eos>
 The numbers simply do not mean anything <eos>
 Oh yes they do . Look . One s like a tall princess . <eos>
 A princess ? <eos>
 That s right ! <eos>
 This s more fun than just pretend . <eos>
 Of course <eos>
 That one s an elm . <eos>
 My dolls . We can pretend . <eos>
 Yes winter s coming . I do not like the winter <eos>
 Oh thank you Amy . <eos>
 You can open it now I guess . Lois Huggins says that s proper <eos>
 A merry Christmas to you Amy . <eos>
 You wanted to share this moment with me . <eos>
 It stands so still . <eos>
 Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind . <eos>
 I can sea its breath in the cold . <eos>
 It s wildness and freedom . No one can touch it . <eos>
 I want to touch it . <eos>
 Do not cry Amy . <eos>
 But she s dead ! <eos>
 Amy listen to me . Death s not such a terrible thing . <eos>
 Oh it s it is ! Death s terrible . <eos>
 But Amy ! Amy . I am dead . <eos>
 Yes Amy . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 That s a fine looking ring . <eos>
 A lady threw it to me . <eos>
 I would not be surprised if it were a true wishing ring . <eos>
 Let me take another look at that ring . <eos>
 Soon as I finish . <eos>
 But Mrs . Farren just started to tell me a story . Please . <eos>
 But I saw what it was . It s the little deer . <eos>
 But what happened to the little deer ? <eos>
 Probably hit by a car . Hard to see things in the twilight . <eos>
 Why s it just lying there ? Why does not it get up ? <eos>
 Because it can not . It s dead . <eos>
 But it was alive it was fast and strong ! <eos>
 It got hit . <eos>
 The ring ? We will have no more nonsense about the ring . <eos>
 No thank you . <eos>
 Do you know the story of The Headless Horseman ? <eos>
 Why has not he got a head ? <eos>
 Do not you hear it ? <eos>
 Do not you read Shakespeare ? <eos>
 Yes yes <eos>
 I can not do it ! I can not do it ! <eos>
 My daughter died long ago . <eos>
 Anybody could know that song . <eos>
 And my eyes . my eyes are gray . Look ! You see ! <eos>
 Yes . yes that s true . <eos>
 And my hair . what color hair did Barbara have ? <eos>
 It was pale . a shadowed gold . <eos>
 Yes Barbara . Barbara . <eos>
 Good night . Barbara . <eos>
 Now I do not know Amy <eos>
 That s from her that woman . <eos>
 Wait a minute . Listen . <eos>
  <eos>
 Yes everything s all right Edward . <eos>
 She pleaded so to do it <eos>
 So do I Mr . Reed . <eos>
 Perhaps she s wanted for understanding . <eos>
 That many women in one place nothing good can come from that . <eos>
 Sorry about Frida . She s been friends with Jen forever . <eos>
 Can we get some service here ? <eos>
 Sorry do not mean to be wolfing down . I am just starving . <eos>

 What does that have to do with me ? <eos>
 Anything s better than Mark . <eos>
 My shrink says he s not so bad . <eos>
 Maybe he s just shy . <eos>
 My date always pays more attention to you than to me . <eos>
 I would kill for just a little bloated . <eos>
 Only to see . <eos>
 Ca not you get contacts ? <eos>
 No it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye . <eos>
 Try to get through dinner without them . You have beautiful eyes . <eos>
 Or if your boyfriend s an asshole . <eos>
 Frida grab that red one . <eos>
 And she got the medium . <eos>
 Where ? Where do you think a mustache would be . Look ! <eos>
 I do not see anything . Maybe just a little . <eos>
 Holy shit I am a freak . <eos>
 Oh my glasses ! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them . <eos>
 There you go blaming yourself for everything again . <eos>
 And he was ripped limb from limb ? <eos>
 I am sure they were exaggerating . <eos>
 Why would they exaggerate ? <eos>
 Did I kill him ? Of course not ! <eos>
 No did you fuck him ? <eos>
 No . I do not think so . <eos>
 You do not think so ? You either did or your did not . <eos>
 And my bra finally fits again . <eos>
 My vision got worse again . <eos>
 No Mark wears boxers . They must have been in the dryer already . <eos>
 Uh huh . good thing those cops did not see that . <eos>

 You said you were going to stay . What happened ? <eos>
 That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind . <eos>
 Does Luke know ? <eos>
 We ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Not you ? <eos>
 Me ? I do not know what you mean . <eos>
 You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me . <eos>
 What was it ? <eos>
 Now do not panic . We do not know that . <eos>
 Ooops ! I guess you have not told Luke about that yet . <eos>
 Do not worry your holiness I will get her started . <eos>
 This baby s got a few surprises left in her . <eos>
 I will be surprised if we ever start moving . <eos>
 Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us . <eos>
 Or you ran into something . <eos>
 Let s hope so . it s just the chance we need . <eos>
 To get killed . you are not seriously going into an asteroid field ? <eos>
 I take it back . <eos>
 That Star Destroyer s slowing down . <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 We have got to get out of this shower . <eos>
 Now you are making sense . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 That should do nicely . <eos>
 Very funny . You can let go now . I am getting angry . <eos>
 You do not look angry . <eos>
 How do I look ? <eos>
 Beautiful . <eos>
 Well I hope you do not expect more . <eos>
 I do not expect anything except to be left alone . <eos>
 Felt like a hydro concussion . an Imperial Cruiser . <eos>
 Would you please stop calling me that ? <eos>
 Yes you do . <eos>
 That s quite a compliment . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>

 Outside in the cave . <eos>
 But the tremors have stopped . <eos>
 The entrance s collapsing ! <eos>
 It s not my fault . I can not under stand it ! <eos>

 I opened thousands of brains . <eos>
 What did you find ? <eos>
 Big mess every time . <eos>
 Crosstown . <eos>
 Very bad today . <eos>
 What do you mean we must abandon ? <eos>
 Ruptured steam pipe . <eos>
 Contaminated substance . Very dangerous . Shooting mud . <eos>
 Do not inhale . <eos>
 That s where I peed . <eos>
 Paisley Porter . I did not know you were waiting tables . <eos>
 Elliot ? <eos>
 This s a great young out of work actress . <eos>
 Alla puttanesca . <eos>
 Is not she great ? What did I tell you ? A talent . <eos>
 Shut up Elliot . <eos>
 Quietly effective . <eos>
 Press a button and they give us money . <eos>
 Ride with me . We need a haircut . <eos>
 She wants a divorce . <eos>
 Do not talk like that . <eos>
 It s over finished and done with . <eos>
 That sounds so final . But are we really surprised ? <eos>
 I am completely stunned . I do not want this to happen . <eos>
 But did not we know it would happen ? <eos>
 Asbestos lining . <eos>
 We must abandon . <eos>
 Do not inhale . <eos>
 You used to love life . You do not exude this any more . <eos>
 What do I exude ? <eos>

 Shit . They do not have any carrot soup . <eos>
 You mean because What s His Name . <eos>
 It s just a review . Do not inhale . Very dangerous . <eos>
 What s the fuss ? I do not get it . <eos>
 That s what I said eighteen months ago . <eos>
 What happened eighteen months ago ? <eos>
 Steven Schwimmer . I memorized every word of this review . <eos>
 That s awful . <eos>
 I recite it to myself with masochistic relish . <eos>
 A year and a half later ? You are still brooding ? <eos>
 I said I am dead . He killed me . <eos>
 Do we care ? <eos>
 I think we Nought to wait . <eos>
 I say we go . <eos>
 You say we go ? <eos>

 Here we go . <eos>
 Do not wait Efor me . <eos>
 What about the haircut ? <eos>
 Then you should carry a gun . <eos>
 Where s it ? <eos>
 I gave it away . I thought I am a writer now . <eos>
 That was a big mistake . <eos>
 No we are not . <eos>
 He will hate it . <eos>
 There are things that speak to us from the past . <eos>
 The American theater does not need people like that . <eos>
 How do you Eknow . <eos>
 Paisley Porter . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 She was very evasive . <eos>
 Unbelievable . <eos>
 Classic . <eos>
 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 What are we talking about ? <eos>
 Yes . What are you implying ? <eos>
 Did you see the winning run score ? <eos>
 You are not making sense . Make sense . <eos>
 This could be it . <eos>
 Let s work on it . <eos>
 Let s work on it . <eos>
 This could be it . <eos>
 This could be it . <eos>
 This could be it . <eos>
 This could be it . <eos>

 Does what feel comfortable ? <eos>
 This could be it . <eos>
 This could be it . <eos>

 I talked to her two days ago . <eos>
 Apparently it did not help . You know about Peter of course . <eos>
 Our Peter ? <eos>
 The Red Sox <eos>
 You mean the World Series ? I thought the Red Sox were winning . <eos>
 We are able to surprise each other . <eos>
 In and out of bed . <eos>
 Because we are completely mismatched . <eos>
 We do not even like each other do we ? <eos>
 They will lose because they are my team . <eos>
 He will absolutely hate it . <eos>
 I go to college . I thought you knew . <eos>
 Do you want to get some coffee ? <eos>
 Why do you need a radio ? <eos>
 Is it ? <eos>
 Do not talk like that . How prominent ? What are you implying ? <eos>
 Thanks Daddy . But I just need one . Mother s not going . <eos>
 Opening night ? <eos>

 I do not have a date . I do not want a date . <eos>
 Can we talk later ? Will you be at the party ? <eos>
 I am not sure . <eos>
 Everything . <eos>
 There s nothing left for me to lie about . <eos>
 Daddy wait . <eos>
 It s only our first date . <eos>
 First you tell me . <eos>
 Brilliantly moving . <eos>
 Packs an emotional wallop . <eos>
 What else ? <eos>
 A flat out hit . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 This building s not secure . <eos>
 Mystery . Deception . <eos>
 Deception s not something I personally consider sexy . <eos>
 What s sexy ? <eos>
 Knowing who a person is . Down deep . <eos>
 Even if the truth about a person s sad or depressing or shocking ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 It s your best play Nicky . <eos>
 See Daddy . <eos>
 An artistry and sensitivity you have never shown before . <eos>
 Two all after six . <eos>
 All right . What s been going on ? <eos>
 I have been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer . <eos>
 How prominent ? <eos>
 Who the hell cares ? <eos>
 And you have been extremely patient . <eos>
 I went because you went . You smoked because I smoked . <eos>
 That s very lovely actually . <eos>
 There may be things you would rather not know about . <eos>
 I want to know . We have not talked this way in years . <eos>
 I had an affair are you sure you want to hear this ? <eos>
 Joanne Bourne . <eos>
 Alma Wetzel . <eos>
 Nicky no . This s insupportable . How could you ? <eos>
 I am a man . She s you know a woman . <eos>
 She s my gynecologist . <eos>
 It violates so many trusts . <eos>
 It was an animal thing . No real intimacy . <eos>
 They are always winning . Until they lose . <eos>
 Life s good . <eos>
 I do not know if I can say that . <eos>
 Washed away . <eos>
 One more out . <eos>
 A thousand things . <eos>
 You are hurting my head . <eos>
 This could be it ! <eos>
 Life s real . <eos>
 I am at the door . <eos>
 Go way . I will call a cop . <eos>
 Pop will you let me in ? <eos>
 Where the hell are you ? <eos>
 Right here . At the door . <eos>
 It s me . Nicky . <eos>
 Nicky comes on Sunday s . <eos>
 Where are your glasses ? Go get them . <eos>
 If it s you what are you doing here ? <eos>
 I am on my way to get a haircut . <eos>
 Where does Nicky get his hair cut ? <eos>
 Do not make me sit through one of your plays . <eos>
 Let s not start that again . <eos>
 My back s killing me . <eos>
 Where s your elastic brace ? <eos>
 I can not find it . <eos>
 You are suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble . <eos>
 I lost it . I lose everything . <eos>
 I will go get you another one . You have to wear it . <eos>
 I know Pop . <eos>
 What do you want me to do ? <eos>
 Show him who we are . <eos>
 You are Frankie Lazzaro . The gangster from Rhode Island . <eos>
 Oh yeah ? <eos>
 Might be an accident on the West Side Highway . <eos>
 How come you got the kid with you ? <eos>
 Matthew s my grandson . <eos>
 A grandmother . God bless you . <eos>
 This s one charming crook . If shooting people s charming . <eos>
 Now that s a complicated subject . <eos>
 That s a simple subject . <eos>
 What am I doing ? <eos>
 You are charming the boy . <eos>
 Hey Toyota . He asked me a question . <eos>
 It s a simple subject . <eos>
 Life s good . <eos>
 Speak it like it s real . Matthew . <eos>
 Matthew . <eos>
 He used to love losers . But the laws of physics changed . <eos>
 Because life s good . <eos>
 Because faith s rewarded . <eos>
 It s a test all right . They are bringing in Stanley . <eos>
 This could be it ! <eos>
 Why does it matter ? <eos>
 If they lost tonight they will lose tomorrow . It s all over . <eos>
 Why do you care ? <eos>
 They are my team . <eos>
 No . They are not your team . They are my team . <eos>
 You are out of bullets . <eos>
 You are dangling from the last letter of your last name . <eos>
 How come ? <eos>
 Hurry back . Hurry back to what ? <eos>
 Eleventh inning . What else ? <eos>
 You are not making sense . <eos>
 Because he s so deeply hated by so many people in the business . <eos>
 Sidney . <eos>
 Sidney Fabrikant . Our producer . <eos>
 I was educated by nuns . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I have excellent long term memory . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth . <eos>
 Yes Peter . <eos>
 But my parasite s consuming all the new memories . Eating my lines . <eos>
 What was your favorite color crayon growing up ? <eos>
 Burnt sienna . <eos>
 Mine was cobalt blue . <eos>
 I kissed her while she was laughing . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 We have a very nice pasta today . Alla Putanesca . <eos>
 I was in the fish market play . What happened to him ? <eos>
 There was a review . <eos>
 I think I remember . <eos>
 So does Elliot . <eos>
 Not one of Steven s finer moments . <eos>
 Oh . You know him . <eos>
 A little . <eos>
 And he has finer moments now and then . <eos>
 He has something . A funny little quality I find <eos>
 Endearing . <eos>
 Engaging . <eos>
 Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike . <eos>
 A little drastic maybe ? <eos>
 Say it again . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You know what . <eos>
 Alla puttanesca . <eos>
 One more time . <eos>
 I was one of those silent listening children . Glued to the shadows . <eos>
 So do I . Over and over . <eos>
 Peter Redmond s an actor I admire enormously . <eos>
 Would you like to meet him ? <eos>
 He does not want to meet some out of work ingenue . <eos>
 Is it true ? <eos>
 Is what true ? <eos>
 He wears a disguise . <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 He s a very sweet man . <eos>
 Where are you going now ? <eos>
 Home . <eos>
 Someone waiting for you ? <eos>
 No one s waiting . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Never mind . <eos>
 Our Steven not only disguises himself . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He goes to the theater armed . <eos>
 I am actually beginning to enjoy this . <eos>
 But you are here . So you must have come to me . <eos>
 I do not want you Steven . <eos>
 I am going home to my machine . <eos>
 They are boys . And they are Indian . <eos>
 Are you sure ? <eos>
 Yes I can not talk like this . <eos>
 Mr . Khan said they called you brave . <eos>
 It s the work of untouchables . <eos>
 All the more reason . <eos>
 There s no room ! And the air s lovely . <eos>
 Eleven . <eos>
 I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people . <eos>
 I will follow you in all our vows and duties . <eos>
 No . That s what you get for distracting me . <eos>
 What do you expect when you talk like that ? <eos>
 I expect you to show as much patience as I am now . <eos>
 One more . <eos>
 Nothing s more dangerous especially for an old man . <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>
 I thought you were a man of God . <eos>
 Well we shall try . <eos>
 Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall . <eos>
 Going nearer to God ! <eos>
 It does . We must be getting old Charlie . <eos>
 Back in South Africa . long time ago . <eos>
 What was he like ? <eos>
 He said he s in charge . <eos>
 Hell ! <eos>
 A a week . <eos>
 Well I do not know how you got a ticket for <eos>
 No no just a moment please . <eos>
 We must end the campaign . <eos>
 Tell that to the families of the policemen who died . <eos>
 Panditji please help me . <eos>
 You will respect the law . <eos>
 There are unjust laws as there are unjust men . <eos>
 I hope not . <eos>
 Even as a boy I thought so . <eos>
 Perhaps . I have come here to think about it . <eos>
 A great deal . <eos>
 I would rather march . <eos>
 First spin . Let the others march for a time . <eos>
 There s nothing I can give . <eos>
 That was England . <eos>
 It s split the Government . <eos>
 Well that s one victory . <eos>
 Thank you . No . <eos>
 I dined at the prison . <eos>
 Ahh . <eos>
 Somehow I expected not . <eos>
 I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment . <eos>
 I am I am afraid I have no money . <eos>
 Oh ! Neither have I . I am awfully sorry . <eos>
 No but I think I am going to . <eos>
 Have you found him ? <eos>
 Bapu please . Where are you going . <eos>
 It s over . <eos>
 Is that the only way you can succeed Anton to see me fail ? <eos>
 It s for the best . <eos>
 You did not beat me that day . I beat i myself i . <eos>
 Who are you trying to convince ? <eos>
 Er no . <eos>
 It would be five thousand more . <eos>
 No ? What s keeping you ? <eos>
 I guess I am a slow learner . <eos>
 I will take care of it . <eos>
 Of course Sir . We are checking the entry log alibis grudges . <eos>
 Grudges ? <eos>
 With respect Sir it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests <eos>
 What i about i his profile ? <eos>
 I will run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections <eos>
 This i is i the most likely location <eos>
 None of the ID photos match the enhancement . <eos>
 Something s not right . <eos>
 He s not here . It s a blind alley . <eos>
 No we have missed something . We Hoover again . <eos>
 We do not have the manpower . <eos>
 Get it . From outside if you have to . <eos>
 From what budget ? <eos>
 Where do we start ? <eos>
 We will vacuum these streets if we have to . <eos>
 Where did you get this ? <eos>
 Often . <eos>

 I returned recently from a stay in hospital . <eos>
 What was wrong ? <eos>
 Nothing serious . A touch of stroke . <eos>
 To an artistic eye you understand . Have you ever modeled ? <eos>

 Football in college . <eos>
 You went to university ? <eos>
 Just a year . I dropped out to join the Marines . <eos>
 Yes . You were a Marine . <eos>
 Indeed . I would pay for the privilege of drawing your head . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him . <eos>
 And it s just my head you want ? Nothing else ? <eos>
 Excellent . We will have a most interesting time . <eos>
 Bride of Frankenstein . <eos>
 It s new . <eos>
 Pish posh Mr . Boone . I am not your Aunt Tilly . <eos>

 Go ahead . <eos>
 This David s a friend ? <eos>

 You do not think of me that way do you ? <eos>
 What way might that be ? <eos>
 You know . Look at me like like I look at women . <eos>
 But we have to match the other sketch . <eos>
 I am fine . I would just rather keep it on . <eos>

 Thoreau with a lawnmower . <eos>
 It s so far in the past now . Over fifteen years <eos>
 Better work . <eos>
 Oh no . I never swim . <eos>

 Not at all . I was in the foxholes myself . <eos>
 You were a soldier ? <eos>

 David . The friend I thought was in New York . <eos>

 Girl ? Oh . Elizabeth Taylor . <eos>

 Never gave it much thought . <eos>
 But you said <eos>

 Them s the breaks right ? No war stories for this pup . <eos>
 Not at all . <eos>

 James Whale . This afternoon at the party . <eos>

 First I need a copy of the key . <eos>

 I beeped you over two hours ago . <eos>
 And something else that might interest you . <eos>
 One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell s knapsack . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 What happened at that signing ? <eos>
 How do you mean ? <eos>
 That boyfriend . Randy . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Seven years . <eos>

 One word to I . A . and he walks . <eos>
 Maybe not . We could talk to Buck . <eos>
 No way . <eos>
 What are we thinking ? <eos>
 Will ? <eos>
 You do not have to be involved Will . <eos>
 You tell Buck and I am involved whether I like it or not . <eos>
 I am always all business . <eos>
 That s not what he thinks . <eos>
 What did he look like ? <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 Kay Connell . Did you love her ? <eos>
 You heard me that time . <eos>
 She loved me . She wanted to see me every night . <eos>
 But she was seeing someone else on the side . <eos>
 Friday night at the party what would you fight about ? <eos>
 Stuff . <eos>
 What kind of stuff ? <eos>
 Just stuff . I do not fucking remember . <eos>
 The other guy ? <eos>
 I told you I do not remember . <eos>
 After that she left the party to go to him . <eos>
 How should I know ? <eos>
 Ran like hell to go to him . <eos>
 Fuck you man ! I am sick of all your fucking cop questions . <eos>
 You do not know . <eos>
 She did not tell me . <eos>
 Good to see you too Randy . <eos>
 You are not missing much . <eos>
 What are you doing in this shit hole town ? <eos>
 Best friend ? <eos>
 Since grade school . <eos>
 That s a long time . <eos>
 We were like sisters . Knew everything about each other . <eos>
 Must be tough for you . What happened . <eos>
 Long as it s fun . <eos>
 Thought you wanted something fun . <eos>
 That s what I said . <eos>
 Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz ? <eos>
 You do not know . <eos>
 She would not tell me ! <eos>
 But you were such good i friends . i <eos>
 What was ? <eos>
 My arm ! <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 She used some stupid code name . <eos>
 What was it ? <eos>
 Brody . I do not know . . Something Brody ! <eos>
 The phone call . The knapsack . <eos>
 I said you are going to get a phone call . <eos>
 Oh ? <eos>
 Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books . <eos>
 Thought you might find that . <eos>
 You are going to be brought in for questioning . <eos>
 Yes down at the station . <eos>
 But she was an attractive girl . <eos>
 I suppose . <eos>
 Did you have sex with her ? <eos>
 But you wanted to . <eos>
 I was a mentor to her . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Expensive dresses . A heart necklace . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Does not sound like a mentor to me . <eos>
 I gave her things she did not have . Could not have . <eos>
 He . Well he . <eos>
 Told you I could write an ending . <eos>
 Congratulations . <eos>
 There s nothing more to talk about . <eos>
 But we work so well together . <eos>
 Then so was mine . <eos>
 Do not you pull that shit with me . <eos>
 I did not want to kill her Will . <eos>
 This an accident Walter ? <eos>
 If you want it to be . <eos>
 No back up . <eos>
 You are not following procedure . <eos>
 Procedure went out the window a long time ago . <eos>
 Drop the gun Walter . <eos>
 Yes and very beautiful . <eos>
 Your lips they did not move . <eos>
 But how did you come into existence ? <eos>
 If there were a leader I would be the one . <eos>
 Ah ! You have questions ? <eos>
 What are we ? <eos>
 Nothing if not vampires . <eos>
 Who made us what we are ? <eos>
 Surely you know the one who made you . <eos>
 You mean we are not children of Satan ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Perhaps . <eos>
 Then God does not exist . <eos>
 I have not spoken to him . <eos>
 And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil ? <eos>
 Knew ? You mean he is . <eos>
 Listen to me . <eos>
 Your lover . <eos>
 No my beloved my child . <eos>
 If you say so . You are innocent . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 You said there were none . <eos>
 How he must have loved you . <eos>
 Yes . My God . <eos>
 Follow me that way through my cell <eos>
 I can not save her . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 And yet you knew what I would o . <eos>
 What a pair we are . We deserve each other do not we ? <eos>
 We are a pair and that s what counts . <eos>
 What night ? What do you mean ? <eos>
 You always give me the doll on the same night of the year . <eos>
 I did not realise . <eos>
 Is this my birthday ? <eos>
 But you are the fairest by far . <eos>
 And if I cut my hair again ? <eos>
 It will grow back again ! <eos>
 Stop her Louis ! <eos>
 DID YOU DO IT TO ME ? <eos>
 Not you my dear . <eos>
 You are a liar . But you upset my plans . <eos>
 What plans ? <eos>
 No . Laudanum . <eos>
 Yes . It killed them unfortunately . But it keeps the blood warm . <eos>
 Louis put me in my coffin . <eos>
 I will put you in your coffin . Forever . <eos>
 What have you done ? <eos>
 The way I learn everything . By watching you . <eos>
 Lestat taught you all you need to know about that . <eos>
 Why does he call you that ? <eos>
 Hush Claudia do not talk about such things . Show me your book . <eos>
 Sit still . It s not finished <eos>
 Claudia do not <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Tell me why . you have got to tell me . <eos>
 I took your life . He gave you another one . <eos>
 Do not mock me Louis . Help me . <eos>
 The swamp . <eos>
 I can not . Go away from me . <eos>
 And you never cried <eos>
 Tell me you do not hate me Louis . I did it for you <eos>
 The workmen must have a trunk do not stop cherie <eos>
 It is ! Take the back stairwell <eos>
 Not yet . <eos>
 Still my beautiful child . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Well tell me papa . What was it like making love ? <eos>
 Claudia you torture yourself . <eos>
 You are neither Claudia . Now stop this <eos>
 How devilishly clever . <eos>
 No . She s frightened . She does not know where she is . <eos>
 And no one knows but us . <eos>
 Yes and very beautiful . <eos>
 Be still ! <eos>
 No you would not Louis . Danger hold you to me . <eos>
 Love holds you to me . And we are in danger not you . <eos>
 Love ? <eos>
 Never . <eos>
 Let him go he said . Let him go . <eos>
 You really believe that ? <eos>
 It s only mortal death . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 Then my luck would have changed . <eos>
 You want death ? Is it death you want ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why should I be ? <eos>
 Vampires . We thrive on blood . <eos>
 I want it ! <eos>
 Call him . <eos>
 I can not do it . <eos>
 You have just done it <eos>
 Kill me if you will but I can not do this . <eos>
 Your perfect . Your bitter and you are strong . <eos>
 But why do you want me ? <eos>
 Because you are as strong as I was when I was alive . <eos>
 Yes . Kill me . Kill me like you promised <eos>
 You asked for death . I did not promise it <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 I want a woman . <eos>
 The crucifix <eos>
 Forget the crucifix . Take him . <eos>
 You have fed . You were made for this . <eos>
 You have killed Louis . And enjoyed it . <eos>
 We can live like this ? Off the blood of animals ? <eos>
 Fascination . <eos>
 Yes . And I am bored with this prattle <eos>
 Read her thoughts . <eos>
 I can not . <eos>
 I do not know any hell <eos>
 As did the one who made me . <eos>
 I do not pretend to know . <eos>
 I know . Let her alone . <eos>
 You finish her if you feel so much <eos>
 NO ! <eos>
 THEN YOU KILL HER ! <eos>
 What are you saying ? <eos>
 You need company Louis . More congenial than mine . <eos>
 You remember how you wanted her the taste of her <eos>
 I did not want to kill her . <eos>
 That s enough cherie . Stop before the heart stops . <eos>
 Shhhh ! Do you want to frighten our little daughter ? <eos>
 Louis Louis I gave you the gift help me <eos>
 Are you mad ? <eos>
 Yes . Past . she should never have been one of us . <eos>
 Do not fear me Lestat . I bring you no harm . <eos>
 You know I love the dark . But there s no dark anymore . <eos>
 It s false light Lestat . It can not harm you . <eos>
 You remember how I was Louis . the vampire Lestat . <eos>
 Yes . I remember . <eos>
 You followed me here did not you ? <eos>
 So shall we begin ? What do yo do ? <eos>
 I am a vampire . <eos>
 Perhaps lucky for both of us . <eos>
 Yes but you need not worry about that now . Things change . <eos>
 But I thought vampires did not like the light . <eos>
 We love it . I only wanted to prepare you . <eos>
 Oh that rumour about crosses ? <eos>
 You can not look at them . <eos>
 The same . As you would say today . Bull shit . <eos>
 What about coffins ? <eos>
 Coffins . coffins unfortunately are a necessity . <eos>
 Can a vampire feel love ? <eos>
 You loved your wife surely . <eos>
 He did it to make you stay with him ! <eos>
 How could I not ? She had to know . <eos>
 And did you lose her ? Did she go ? <eos>
 But it has . There s no more to tell . <eos>

 Thank you . <eos>
 Sleep well . <eos>

 I think she went to bed I saw her going toward the house <eos>
 On my word ! That s what they believe . <eos>
 Sharp shiny teeth and they creep up to your bed <eos>
 Closer and closer until they bite into your throat ! <eos>
 Poor Cathy <eos>
 I am so ill I am so exhausted I almost do not care . <eos>
 Some village in the mountains Alethera I think . <eos>
 She has never mentioned her family . <eos>
 How old s she ? <eos>
 I was looking for you . <eos>
 They shall not hurt you <eos>
 Thea s an orphan . <eos>
 What an odd question ! <eos>
 What s it what are you talking about ? <eos>
 You have forgotten my last name ? <eos>
 My last name s Pherides . <eos>
 The General you do not even know him . <eos>
 That should decide it or you <eos>
 It was the plague <eos>
 Whet do you mean ? <eos>
 Did not you ? But now what are you thinking now ? <eos>
 That your father and I <eos>
 No . I mean your other secret <eos>
 Would not I ? <eos>
 I do not care who he is . He does not know . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Theodosia . <eos>
 Her family name ? <eos>
 She s not too well . <eos>
 What s her illness ? <eos>
 Nothing really . She s been under a great strain the journey the battle <eos>
 Was she ill before that girl came into your household ? <eos>
 Why no not before Thea came <eos>
 There s no one there nothing but the caves and the dead . <eos>
 I will only go as far as the shore and wait for you . <eos>
 Oh now now look here <eos>
 I can not understand that . <eos>
 We have no time for that . <eos>
 The rider on the pale horse s Pestilence . He follows the wars . <eos>
 But the war the army they need you . <eos>
 Better no general than one carrying the plague . <eos>
 We still do not know that it s the plague <eos>
 If she looked like Thea she must have been beautiful . <eos>
 In a way this girl Thea . You must stay away from her . <eos>
 I had a notion you had become self appointed chaperone lately why ? <eos>
 You are my friend . <eos>
 Listen to what I say <eos>
 When you make sense I will listen . <eos>
 Not Theodosia . Theodosia s daughter your daughter . <eos>
 I do not know . Everything s so mixed up <eos>
 Everything s so simple . I like you . <eos>
 You see ? Thea believes it too ! <eos>
 The General threatened me . <eos>
 Well tell him . <eos>

 Why in the world can not you ? <eos>
 He hates all my race . <eos>
 Well you are begging and that s a whole lot worse . <eos>

 It s easier to lure sharks at night . <eos>

 You amaze me . I am more scared than you . <eos>

 Get some sleep . And tell Sean I am sorry . <eos>

 They are not going to hurt you . They are encased in plastic . <eos>
 I do not want to see them Kathryn . <eos>

 It s too soon to move him . <eos>
 So tell Calvin . <eos>

 Well that s why you got it . <eos>
 Hydrophobia . <eos>
 Michael take deep breaths . <eos>
 I have to get out of here . <eos>

 So ? <eos>
 It was removed from Charlie Overman s body . <eos>

 That s why they are always moving . They have to have it . <eos>
 You wanted to know about a cave ? <eos>

 On the telly . We are to film him for the evening news . <eos>
 Nobody told me . <eos>

 They are not tricks . They are behavior patterns . <eos>
 Fine . Have them do some . <eos>
 I do not know . They are nervous and skittish right now . <eos>
 Yes are not we all . <eos>
 Make this quick ! <eos>
 Well then can you have them jump to the camera over here ? <eos>
 I can have them walk backwards . <eos>

 I told you something s upset them . <eos>
 Sharks are man biters Mister Hutton . Not man eaters <eos>
 That s preposterous ! <eos>
 I have handled sharks before . Bigger than this one . <eos>
 Calvin let me go down there and kill the bastard . <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Well then I am going to film it . <eos>

 Shark bait . Draws them over for closeups . <eos>
 What in hell s that ? <eos>

 Let s hope he knows that . <eos>
 Because I do not trust you that s why . <eos>
 Afraid I can not do that . <eos>
 You are supposed to film it not turn it to hash ! <eos>
 Still sleeping . <eos>
 Kiss him maybe he will turn into a frog . <eos>
 Should be coming out of it soon . <eos>

 I have to get this finished . <eos>
 There s nothing to worry about . <eos>
 I am your mother . It s my job . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why would you come out here ? <eos>
 Why would you take the boat ? <eos>
 There s a lot . I want to talk about it . <eos>
 Promise me . <eos>
 Mostly it feels like driving . You digging for buried treasure ? <eos>
 It could have been an accident . <eos>
 It was no accident . <eos>
 I am not saying you are wrong just that there are other possibilities . <eos>
 Does not matter . <eos>
 Boss day off . Take the wheel . <eos>
 I can not . <eos>
 Sure you can . <eos>
 I do not know how . <eos>
 No one does till they learn . <eos>
 If you do not take it we will be swimming in a minute . <eos>
 Where do I pull off . <eos>
 Got picked up by a tribe of head hunters . <eos>
 You are impossible . <eos>
 It s wonderful . <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 No you are not . <eos>
 I am terrific . Come on . <eos>
 A big one . <eos>
 A big one . <eos>
 All or nothing . You want to roll them for me ? <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 You will be sorry . <eos>
 Good . I have two left . <eos>
 I have my own little island . <eos>
 But it gets cold in winter . <eos>
 I dreamed about always being warm . Stay a while . <eos>
 You are always taking time off . <eos>
 I like to travel . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I borrow it without telling him . <eos>
 Wo not you get in trouble . <eos>
 There are . I am tired of one way conversations . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 There s nothing to be sorry about . <eos>
 The whole idea s preposterous . <eos>
 My vision s perfect . <eos>
 Give me a hand here for Christ s sake . <eos>
 Yes you can . <eos>
 I have coffee in the thermos . <eos>
 I am too young for coffee . Can I drive the plane ? <eos>
 How come it bumps up and down when there s no road ? <eos>
 The wind does that . Ever been to the Bahamas before ? <eos>
 I do . <eos>
 I am the artist . Like my mother . <eos>
 Just like that ? <eos>
 Yes I can . <eos>
 We will buy you one . We are having a party . <eos>
 A shark attacked Thea and some kids . She s going after it . <eos>
 She said it was coming . <eos>
 You sure you know how to do this . <eos>
 Hell no . What kind of pilot do you think I am . <eos>
 Get her started . <eos>
 Aye aye Captain . <eos>
 I fly elephants for smugglers . <eos>
 All you passengers are the same . Complain . Complain . <eos>
 Nothing ! What the hell are you doing down there ? <eos>
 It needs more time to charge . <eos>
 Tell Thea I am sorry . <eos>
 Still chasing fish ? <eos>
 Still tagging conch ? <eos>
 We will be done pretty soon . <eos>
 Tricky little devils are not they ? How s the degree doing ? <eos>
 Inch by inch . <eos>
 How s Ellen ? <eos>
 She s a tough lady . <eos>
 I wish there was something I could do . <eos>
 She s had a lot to deal with . She needs time . <eos>
 Feathers all over the place . <eos>
 It was like having snow in the house . Jesus I miss them . <eos>
 I will get her . Have a good Christmas Matt . <eos>
 You too Michael . <eos>
 Stop busting my hump . <eos>
 Try the area around the wreck . <eos>
 Will you leave me alone . <eos>
 You tagging them . <eos>
 I am separating the ladies from the gentlemen . <eos>
 We will pass around cigars . <eos>
 The readings suck . <eos>
 Maybe it s the tags that suck . <eos>
 I made them man . <eos>
 I stuck them on man . <eos>
 You did not stick them on right . <eos>
 If you made them right it would not happen . They leak . <eos>
 A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside . <eos>
 You could not find your ass with both hands . <eos>
 They wo not fight with me . <eos>
 Put me down damnit . <eos>
 Where the hell s the beer . <eos>
 I did not do it on purpose . <eos>
 May your sex life be as busy as your shirt . <eos>
 Forget it . <eos>
 Money s money . <eos>
 They put bombs on dolphins . <eos>

 We do not share our lives the way a lot of people do . <eos>
 Does that mean . <eos>
 We have not slept in the same bed for years . <eos>
 But obviously you still care what happens to him . <eos>
 He s an illusionist . It s not exactly brain surgery . <eos>
 Harry . <eos>
 Harry . <eos>
 I am no bodyguard . <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 You have not seen anything yet . <eos>
 I heard what happened . It looks like somebody murdered him . <eos>
 Well . how about some of the other illusionists ? <eos>
 They wo not tell you anything . <eos>
 I can be very persuasive . <eos>
 Why ? Because he had you ? <eos>
 He . did not have me . I told you <eos>
 You did not marry him for love . <eos>
 That s my business . Harry . <eos>
 It does not ring a bell . I have to go . <eos>
 Okay . I will keep digging . <eos>

 Why do not you tell me the truth ? <eos>
 He was the real thing right ? <eos>
 Swann said he could do stuff yes . <eos>

 Somebody killed him . <eos>

 After that fall ? He must have broken half his bones . <eos>
 vanished . <eos>
 Another fucking magician . Jesus . <eos>
 For now . Are you planning to go back to New York ? <eos>
 No . Not yet . <eos>
 I think we walk a narrow path between . between . <eos>
 Heaven and Hell ? <eos>
 Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real ? <eos>
 I heard he was the best . <eos>
 If he was so good why s he so dead ? <eos>
 I would like to hear them . <eos>
 He was a freak . Everything he did was tainted . <eos>
 Evil . He was evil . Come on . <eos>
 Fuck you . <eos>
 Mr . D Amour ? <eos>
 Go away . <eos>
 It s one in the afternoon . <eos>
 What are you my mother ? <eos>

 Maybe I just bought it . <eos>
 Somebody s been smoking in here for months . <eos>
 You know of him ? <eos>
 I saw him in Vegas once . <eos>
 Are you a gambling man ? <eos>
 When I can afford to lose . Swann s quite a magician . <eos>
 Never call him that . He s strictly an illusionist . <eos>
 What s the difference ? <eos>
 Illusions are trickery . Magicians do it for real . <eos>
 Probably . <eos>
 It s not a bad place . Warm . Great view . <eos>
 I do not think the dead much care . <eos>
 Are you sure ? <eos>
 Are you a believer then ? <eos>
 Swann s wife . <eos>
 Looking for you . I tried the hotel . <eos>
 Why would you come here ? <eos>
 A ticket home <eos>
 Yes . It s regrettable <eos>
 Fuck regrettable ! I want to know why . <eos>
 What for ? You need to stay busy ? <eos>
 I like to know why things happen . <eos>
 Why people die ? Give it up D Amour . Go home . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I am afraid she s not in . <eos>
 When will she be in ? <eos>
 Yeah I know . <eos>
 You want more money s that it ? <eos>

 Was that Swann s idea ? <eos>
 Have not you seen enough to know that does not matter ? <eos>
 Shit . <eos>

 Do not bother . <eos>
 Shut up . We have lost enough lives already . <eos>
 I am sorry D Amour . <eos>
 What about ? <eos>

 A Mister Quaid ? <eos>
 She has no real grip on reality . <eos>
 Does anybody ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You have taken some strange journeys in your life . <eos>
 Yeah . You could say that . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>

 Harry D Amour . <eos>

 D Artagnan . <eos>
 We have much to discuss . Tomorrow . <eos>
 I could not tell you . You had enough to carry . <eos>
 May I speak with you ? Alone ? <eos>
 I am preparing for a ball ! <eos>
 We have not visited in three years . And we should have privacy . <eos>
 I wish to discuss your brother . <eos>
 Why would you ask now ? You never asked before ! <eos>
 Yes . Dead . Two nights ago . The night of my dream . <eos>
 My guards are useless ! Take her from me ! <eos>
 He s your brother ! <eos>
 He s nothing now . <eos>
 Wear it until you love it . And die in it ! <eos>
 How goes that favor I asked of you ? <eos>
 I grow closer to my target your Majesty . <eos>
 Shut up knave ! <eos>
 Replace the king . <eos>
 I am with you ! <eos>
 Making the key to the throne . <eos>
 Come we have a boat waiting . <eos>
 A body . <eos>
 I see that s a body ! But where did you get it ? <eos>
 His plight s obvious s not it ? <eos>
 Tomorrow . <eos>
 I have it all worked out . <eos>
 Physical resemblance s but one small thing ! Louis has an arrogance a manner <eos>
 Those can be adopted <eos>
 And people close to him who <eos>
 Resting he s had a long day . Aramis <eos>
 More wine ! <eos>
 You must reconsider this plan . Phillippe s like a child he <eos>
 You can do it . <eos>
 In a year maybe two I could teach him enough to <eos>
 Three days . <eos>
 Three days ? <eos>
 You grow fond of him . That s good . <eos>
 Do not play God with me Aramis I <eos>
 But what s Porthos doing ? <eos>
 Going into the barn naked or so it appears . <eos>
 But what s he doing ? <eos>
 About to hang himself I should think . <eos>
 The mask s terrifying . especially when unexpected . Do you notice ? <eos>
 All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal . <eos>
 Hold your goblet with two fingers . <eos>
 You are a fool ! <eos>
 Perhaps he serves a different king . <eos>
 To the Bastille . And death . <eos>
 Aramis the King wishes to see you . <eos>
 I will need you all . All for one . One for all . <eos>
 I know . God go with you . <eos>
 You can not do it . <eos>
 Pull them back ! <eos>
 Everyone back . <eos>
 Phillippe get into the boat . Into the boat ! Now ! <eos>
 They will know you helped us if we go this way . <eos>
 That does not matter now . <eos>
 Forgiveness ? <eos>
 Ca not you see I am praying goddammit ? <eos>
 Hell may be our destination dear Porthos but not this trip . <eos>
 It s also a place of burial . <eos>
 A tomb ? We are in a tomb ? <eos>
 Catacombs . Very holy . <eos>
 I expected action . There was no killing no fighting I was useless . <eos>
 The child of the king is . the king . Louis ! <eos>
 No not Louis ! <eos>
 Athos do you understand this ? He confuses me <eos>
 What use am I ? <eos>
 We go someplace dangerous . <eos>
 Why did not you say so ? <eos>
 Come on . <eos>
 So was Mary Magdalene and our Lord loved her . <eos>
 Did she have tits like that ? <eos>
 Then let him kill me if all my faith s wrong . <eos>
 The Queen Mother . Anne . <eos>
 We will make our own luck tonight . if Phillippe holds up . <eos>
 Who does ? <eos>
 Best not to ask . Should not even talk about it . <eos>
 I do not know about you but I plan to wait here . <eos>
 At a ball everyone watches the King ! <eos>
 None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you . <eos>
 Raoul <eos>
 Athos my friend ! <eos>
 You can not drink with a friend you have not seen in months ? <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Oh my friend . <eos>
 Raoul s hurrying to the front so I must hurry too . <eos>
 Save my son d Artagnan . <eos>
 Get out of my way . <eos>
 Athos I beg you <eos>
 To kill the king . <eos>
 I came to see you safely out . Check for yourself . <eos>
 What s its antidote ? <eos>
 It s something I have done or did not do . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 I will sit with you . I can not sleep either . <eos>
 Porthos told me . <eos>
 Your mother s . <eos>
 She will be at the ball . <eos>
 How did you <eos>
 Just . water . <eos>
 Phillippe . Rest now . <eos>
 What s it d Artagnan ? Assassins falling from the sky now ? <eos>
 I decided it this morning . <eos>
 Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that <eos>
 A personal nature ? <eos>
 You dare criticize my father ? Or lecture me ? <eos>
 Silence ! I order you ! <eos>
 Thank you your Majesty . <eos>
 It . was nothing . A nightmare nothing more . Go away I <eos>
 . tired . Must . lie down . <eos>
 Even the bedchamber passages ! Let none remain ! <eos>
 Yes your Majesty . <eos>

 My twin . Which has kept him alive . Until now . <eos>
 There . <eos>

 You may go Lieutenant . <eos>
 Not by you . I will order d Artagnan to do it . <eos>
 Out directing the search for the traitors . <eos>
 When he returns watch him . When he leaves again you tell me . <eos>
 Shoot them ! Shoot them ! <eos>
 What . an excellent idea your Majesty ! <eos>
 You blush ! You do not wish to be beautiful to your King ? <eos>

 Seventy a year . <eos>
 Not bad not bad . <eos>
 How about yourself ? <eos>
 Sixty . <eos>
 That s pretty good for a ghillie . <eos>
 It s only grief makes her like she is . <eos>
 Three years John . Is that not a bit long to be grieving ? <eos>
 She loved him . <eos>
 Come on man . There s love and there s . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You know what I mean . <eos>
 I am not sure I do Archie . <eos>
 The good looking one . <eos>
 Aye ? Then she s obviously not got enough to do . <eos>
 Aye but will they ? <eos>
 John it s not your problem what she eats . <eos>
 But I am the only one she trusts . <eos>
 I am getting dressed . <eos>
 You have got three broken ribs man ! <eos>
 I have got my duties to attend to . <eos>
 She will get over it . <eos>
 I can not let her down now Archie . <eos>
 Come on man I am telling you what you already know . <eos>
 You know nothing about her ! <eos>
 She means it . <eos>
 It s a diary . <eos>
 Be careful who sees it . <eos>
 What do you take me for ? <eos>
 I can not move to tidy . <eos>
 It s what the maids are for . <eos>
 I am not having some prattler going through my things . <eos>
 Mary Taylor sir . <eos>

 Good man . And s she all right ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Are you all right Barney ? <eos>
 Your Royal Highness . What a pleasure to see you here . <eos>
 Have you met Mr Lyle ? He s in sugar . <eos>
 I do not think I have had that pleasure . <eos>
 I take no account of gossip Your Highness . <eos>
 My concern s for the reputation of the Monarchy . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 I beg your pardon ? Mama . <eos>
 She s busy . <eos>
 Convey her a message . <eos>
 She s away to Windsor tomorrow . Talk to her there . <eos>
 I said are you deaf as well as stupid ? <eos>
 Do you know who you address sir ? <eos>
 Whom you address . <eos>
 The future King ! <eos>
 Out of my way ! <eos>
 I thought a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps ? <eos>
 No dinners Bertie . Why are you dressed for outdoors ? <eos>
 It s so infernally cold in here . <eos>
 Cold s good Is that not so Dr . Jenner ? <eos>
 It s a disgusting habit Bertie . It should be discouraged . <eos>
 Yes but s not midnight a little excessive ? <eos>
 It s quite late enough . <eos>
 And that s my last word on the matter . <eos>
 Not now he does not . This s my place . <eos>
 By whose authority ? <eos>
 My own . <eos>
 You will talk when I am finished ! <eos>
 Back and upper corridors . <eos>
 I am sorry ? <eos>
 How will I know what she requires ? <eos>
 You will be sent a message . <eos>
 Who will bring it to me ? <eos>
 Her Highness Equerry . <eos>
 I need a man who knows where I am . <eos>
 I am sure it wo not be difficult to find you . <eos>
 That s not good enough . <eos>
 Aye do . <eos>
 Yes . I do . <eos>
 I beg your pardon ? <eos>
 Is that the Queen s request ? <eos>
 Yes it most certainly is ! <eos>
 That can wait till the weekend . <eos>
 There are important papers from <eos>
 It can wait . Anything else ? <eos>
 Do not think I can not persuade her . <eos>
 I am a blank sheet . <eos>
 Do you hunt ? <eos>
 Occasionally . <eos>
 Dare say you can be taught . <eos>
 To shoot perhaps but not to kill . <eos>
 If you hunt you kill . <eos>
 I am fine . <eos>
 You are injured . <eos>
 It s nothing . <eos>
 Oh . <eos>
 This s the top . <eos>
 Surely <eos>
 What I do I do for my Queen . <eos>
 Was there never ambition ? <eos>
 Maybe once . <eos>
 Then I envy yo . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 For Her Majesty . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 But yourself ? What about John Brown ? <eos>
 I said . I serve the Queen . <eos>
 No other aspiration ? <eos>
 Why do you think I keep her here ? <eos>
 She trusts you John . <eos>
 See what ? <eos>
 The threat . I tell them but they do not see it . <eos>
 They are not as watchful as you . <eos>
 Too busy looking after themselves . <eos>
 The greasy pole . <eos>
 No loyalty . <eos>
 No love . <eos>
 For once in my life I am not the issue . <eos>
 She will never understand it . <eos>
 In time she will . <eos>
 She will think I betrayed her . <eos>
 But others will know that you acted for the greater good . <eos>
 Ma am . <eos>
 You are here safely . <eos>
 Aye ma am . <eos>
 You are well ? <eos>
 I am . <eos>
 And the pony ? <eos>
 She s well too . <eos>
 I am glad of it . <eos>
 Yes . That will be company for you . <eos>
 Yes ma am . <eos>
 Yes ma am . <eos>
 Then why do you persist in doing it ? <eos>
 And I intend to be there when she s ready . <eos>
 He thought so yes . <eos>
 Aye ma am . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Those over there there . <eos>
 Craobhan geanmchno fhiadhaich . <eos>
 Craobhan geanmchno . How can I possibly say that with a straight face ? <eos>
 Are they worth reading ? <eos>
 I am told so . <eos>
 Who by ? <eos>
 Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming . <eos>
 What does he know about the Highlands ? <eos>
 He has been attending at Balmoral for many years . <eos>
 That does not make him an expert . <eos>
 His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject . <eos>
 I hope they did not go to any trouble John . <eos>
 Ah well . <eos>
 To keep out the cold . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 I heard something . <eos>
 I ordered it . It s for your own safety . <eos>
 Dear me you will be telling me to watch what I eat next . <eos>
 Aye . But there are Fenians reported on the mainland . <eos>
 The threat from the Irish s greatly exaggerated I am sure . <eos>
 I will decide when it s exaggerated . <eos>
 Yes ma am ? <eos>
 I was told you were in a fight . <eos>
 Yes ma am . <eos>
 Has someone seen to those bruises ? <eos>
 Yes ma am . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Because I have to ! <eos>
 Not at all Dean . Good of you to spare the time . <eos>
 I came as quickly as I could . <eos>
 You have seen the latest cartoon in Punch I take it ? <eos>
 I beg your pardon ? <eos>
 Oh several things . <eos>
 Indeed and for that they are eternally grateful . <eos>
 Is that not enough ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 The cartoon or Her Majesty s absenteeism ? <eos>
 Well both . <eos>
 The question s do we need her ? <eos>
 Surely you are not suggesting we dispense <eos>
 We will see which way the wind blows . <eos>
 I hope he got his mother s permission . <eos>
 To know when he will be king . <eos>
 You can not know that for sure . <eos>
 Mrs Brown . <eos>
 What s her excuse this time ? <eos>
 Excellent ! <eos>
 No she was not . <eos>
 Not too protracted I hope . <eos>
 Dear oh dear . <eos>
 Quite . I think I would best take it back . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Some young page was boasting about having seen it . Lucky . <eos>
 No indeed . <eos>
 Whom ? <eos>
 Cold s good ! <eos>
 Forgive me Your Majesty . In no way did I wish to suggest <eos>
 I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy . <eos>
 I did not consider it wise in the circumstances to tax your nerves . <eos>
 How ill s he ? <eos>
 Just them ? <eos>
 Yes ma am . <eos>
 What s he doing there ? <eos>
 He appears to be . standing by his horse . <eos>
 Mr Brown s unable to attend today . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I believe he s unwell ma am . <eos>
 Unwell ? <eos>
 I understand he was in a fight . <eos>
 Has he been hurt ? <eos>
 A few days ma am . <eos>
 Why was I not told earlier ? <eos>
 Of course at once . <eos>
 And now I am back . <eos>
 Again ? <eos>
 Read it ! <eos>
 I have no idea . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 I forgive me ma am I am no wiser than yourself . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 I have a letter ma am . <eos>
 From whom ? <eos>
 From Princess Helena and other members of your family . <eos>
 My family s quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person . <eos>
 They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness . <eos>
 Prince Albert s at Windsor ma am . <eos>
 Why s he not here ? <eos>
 He s sick ma am . <eos>
 Then why are you not with him ? <eos>
 You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral . <eos>
 What s the matter with him ? <eos>
 He has typhoid fever ma am . <eos>
 If I tell you then it s no fun . <eos>
 Just tell me the fucking riddle . <eos>
 Well technically yes but this s only the prototype . <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 Yeah who s not . <eos>
 He ? <eos>
 The donor . Maybe he s alive inside the game . <eos>
 And maybe you have been taking too many drugs . <eos>
 How would you know it was us ? <eos>
 It s the game ARCADE . <eos>
 You do not like it ? <eos>
 Neither are we . Something s wrong with the game Mr . Difford . <eos>
 Why do not we take this into my office . <eos>
 There s something wrong with ARCADE . The game s alive somehow . <eos>
 What the hell does that mean ? <eos>
 He s probably outside . You know how he is . Gets bored . <eos>

 They have hypnotized the nation . <eos>
 Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 That s the way of the world . <eos>
 They are shocking the world into remembering the primal law . <eos>
 Survival of the fittest . <eos>
 And then Mallory stops Mickey and says Hey these are the Brothers Hun . <eos>
 They were especially influenced by Conquering Huns of Neptune . <eos>
 So Mallory calls 911 and they took off . <eos>

 Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man ? <eos>
 Sustain all objections but face the truth ! <eos>
 With one of them . <eos>
 Identify him then . Speak to him . <eos>
 You lied . Where s your tribe ? <eos>
 Then you admit <eos>
 Do not be a fool . You are outnumbered and outgunned . <eos>

 Actually you are a different breed . This creature will never evolve . <eos>
 Maybe not . <eos>
 You want her that much ? <eos>
 She s not sick at all . She s pregnant . <eos>
 Except that he s also the Chief Defender of the Faith . <eos>
 Taylor you can not . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 It s humiliating . <eos>
 We can not . <eos>
 It s better than going to prison for heresy . <eos>
 All right but . . you are so damned ugly ! <eos>
 Of course . He saw you moving yours . <eos>
 But perhaps he understood <eos>
 Yes Sir . <eos>
 Do you believe him ? <eos>
 Like you I find it difficult . <eos>
 Where are they now ? <eos>
 Sirs our theories have a bearing on his identity . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 He s dead ! Where ? You saw him ? <eos>

 Jackson looks like you got Elias squad now . <eos>
 I do not want to hear about it Jackson . <eos>
 You do not want to hear about it ? <eos>
 This s one time we could sure use Elias . <eos>
 My name s Larry Mitchell . I live in Vancouver . <eos>
 How far does this train go ? <eos>
 Vancouver B . C . <eos>
 I am going to Vancouver Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 Well . <eos>
 Indefinitely ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 You do not know . <eos>
 Very nice Mitchell turns . <eos>
 No thanks ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Not tonight . <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 I am not in the mood for dining and dancing . <eos>
 We have some nice places around Vancouver . <eos>
 I am sure you have . <eos>
 Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon s parties . They just go . <eos>
 I am trying very hard to be polite about it . <eos>
 Would you mind ? <eos>
 Okay . You win . <eos>
 Why certainly baby . <eos>
 How careful should I be ? <eos>
 Just drunk enough . <eos>
 How soon can I get a plane to Seattle ? <eos>
 Possibly Miss . <eos>
 I am Miss Mayfield . Is Mr . Campbell here ? <eos>
 Sit down then . We often have a double up here . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 It might be worth a Martini to you . <eos>
 No . Are you really going to drink that stuff ? <eos>
 You are drinking it . <eos>
 Whatever you say . <eos>
 I did not say anything . <eos>
 Thanks for the fresh air . That felt good . <eos>
 You are sure Mr . Brandon wo not mind ? <eos>
 No thank you . <eos>
 Much too late . <eos>
 Do not take it so big . it s not a tragedy . <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 How did you meet him ? <eos>
 He knew the immigration officer . He eased himself in . <eos>
 He was a great boy for that . What else ? <eos>
 That s all there is . <eos>
 I would rather wait until it does matter . <eos>
 There was not any plane . <eos>
 It s always a mistake to run away . Always . <eos>
 No thanks . <eos>
 Bad enough . <eos>
 He could hardly help suspecting you . <eos>
 That s putting it mildly . <eos>
 Quarter after one . Why ? <eos>
 There s a lot of night left to live through . <eos>
 Let s not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us . <eos>
 Certainly not to me . <eos>
 Just who are you anyway ? <eos>
 Is this the best you can do ? <eos>
 Dance ? Here ? <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 They know you here know your name . <eos>
 I did not notice him . <eos>
 We walked right passed him . He s following us . <eos>
 Could not be . <eos>
 Then he s <eos>
 Absolutely sure . <eos>
 We will find out . <eos>
 He s not a cop . A cop would not have kneed me . <eos>
 He was following us but he s not a policeman . <eos>
 Us ? <eos>
 All right following me . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 No matter . There s nothing I can do about it . <eos>
 Anything I can do about it ? <eos>
 Nothing matters . <eos>
 No use waiting then . <eos>
 From you I like it . <eos>
 They are going to arrest me . <eos>
 I know . Killaine has a warrant . <eos>
 I have my own warrant . Stop a minute please . <eos>
 How bad s the other thing ? The secret ? <eos>
 You would not like it . I have been there . <eos>
 My father died in jail and he was twice the man I am . <eos>
 You leave it . <eos>
 I can still see the shoreline . The moon s rising . <eos>
 There would be a moon tonight . <eos>
 Frozen . <eos>
 If you are doing all this just for me . <eos>
 That and the fun of it . <eos>
 Including Killaine . I still can not think of you that way . <eos>
 If it was an accident you could have told the truth . <eos>
 So could you . But our records were a little against us . <eos>
 What your father did does not condemn you . <eos>
 You killed him ? <eos>
 Mine ? <eos>
 You think Magruder wants to hang beside me ? <eos>
 Yes . You . You are not really a murderer yet . <eos>
 Do you think I was faking ? <eos>
 If I did I do not now . <eos>
 I would like a dry Martini . Very dry please . <eos>
 Sorry Miss . Beer and ale only . Canadian law . <eos>
 Beer ? Well all right . <eos>
 Beer or ale Miss ? <eos>
 Ale . I do not mind . <eos>
 Right Miss . <eos>
 I do not know her . or particularly want to . <eos>
 I am sorry that s all there is . <eos>
 You did not ask a question . You made a speech . <eos>
 That s an evasion and you know it . <eos>
 It is ? <eos>
 There s the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger . <eos>
 Regimental ! Seaforth Highlanders . <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>
 Stop saying you are sorry . I want information not regrets . <eos>
 Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Where s you get it ? <eos>
 A graduation present . <eos>
 Why do not you arrest me and be done with it . <eos>
 I probably shall after I have tortured you a little more . <eos>
 You must come from pretty far South . <eos>
 I have never been to Florida . <eos>
 True . I was a bit irritable last night . I apologize . <eos>
 You were a galahad compared to some cops I have known . <eos>
 You have had dealings with the police before ? <eos>
 Who has not one way or another ? <eos>
 But not in the investigation of a major crime I hope . <eos>
 Is it a crime ? <eos>
 I would like to believe that . It s not too easy . <eos>
 We try to be decent . <eos>
 If I understand what you meant by that . <eos>
 You understand perfectly . <eos>
 Then there s not much I can do s there ? <eos>
 There s not anything you can do . <eos>
 I do not want to talk . <eos>
 I have come here to arrest you for murder . <eos>
 I might be able to save you . If I knew enough . <eos>
 He looks at the girl looks into her eyes <eos>
 What does he see ? <eos>
 Jeff . Shall we go now Jeff and get it over with ? <eos>
 They will only find someone else who wo not be so kind . <eos>
 To do what ? <eos>
 I can not answer that . <eos>
 What will they do to you ? <eos>
 That s they are business . Can I drop you somewhere ? <eos>
 But even if you were in love with me . <eos>
 Sometimes . <eos>
 I understand Betty . I understand perfectly . <eos>
 Morning . Any calls ? <eos>
 Mr . Reed would like you to call him . <eos>
 All right . Get him . <eos>
 I am not interested in blind dates . <eos>
 I am still asking . What do you want ? <eos>
 For five hundred what do I get ? <eos>
 I go home and paint the kitchen . <eos>
 For two hundred ? <eos>
 I stick around and wait for the five hundred . <eos>
 You mentioned information . <eos>
 Got it on you ? <eos>
 Got the information on you ? <eos>
 Get it in half an hour . <eos>
 In the same elevator . It s a public conveyance . <eos>
 Fascinated . <eos>
 Martini . <eos>
 You Killaine ? <eos>
 Sometimes . <eos>
 And without much discrimination . <eos>
 Leave that one lay . <eos>
 They still hang women in Canada I have heard . <eos>
 What s a buzzer ? <eos>
 So you are not a cop . <eos>
 Me a cop ? What made you think that Mr . Brandon ? <eos>
 Who told you my name ? <eos>
 I have got good ears . <eos>
 A private joke . <eos>
 The usual grind . <eos>
 Round of golf Saturday ? <eos>
 If I can get off . <eos>
 Hardly . Who s the girl ? <eos>
 Yes I have seen it before . <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 Well good night . <eos>
 If it does not take too long . Drink ? <eos>
 Thanks . I do not mind . <eos>
 I never notice the view after the first week . <eos>
 I have a warrant for her arrest . <eos>
 That must hurt . <eos>
 You would be breaking the law . <eos>
 Does not answer the question . <eos>
 The only answer I have for you . <eos>
 Do not kid me . You do not think she murdered Mitchell . <eos>
 It could have been an accident . <eos>
 That COULD BE TOLD . <eos>
 Not if she knew she would not be believed . <eos>
 Wait a minute . I will go with you . <eos>
 Now and then . Mostly just for the fun of it . <eos>
 I tried it once . I lost my shirt . <eos>
 I buy my shirts by the dozen . Fortunately . <eos>
 Where did it all come from ? Or s that a permissible question ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You asked me where it all came from . <eos>
 The liquors lovely . The rest of the party you can have . <eos>
 Lay off can not you ? <eos>
 Did I do something wrong ? <eos>
 Want to walk out . or get thrown out ? <eos>
 You do not throw guests out Brandon . <eos>
 Do not bet on it . I am eccentric . <eos>
 Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 A little something on account perhaps ? <eos>
 Rather more than a little something Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 I am afraid this s all for the moment . <eos>
 Oh shut up ! You have not even got your spats on . <eos>
 I do not think you locked your door . <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 Convenient s not it ? <eos>
 I am sorry Inspector I do not know much about . <eos>
 Recently then . <eos>
 No Not recently . I am sure of that . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Not a floater . Only just dead . <eos>
 Would you ? <eos>
 How important would it have to be ? It s only murder Inspector . <eos>
 Men like you do not need orders . <eos>
 The joint s not open Mac . Who s Brandon ? <eos>
 Go live in a tent . <eos>
 It will be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet . <eos>
 Talk English . How do I know you are you ? <eos>
 You get it s brother . <eos>
 Sounds like a fair swap . Let s take a look . <eos>
 Open it and count it . <eos>
 When you sign for it you count it . It s your dough . <eos>
 So it seems Sergeant . <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 I have met her . <eos>
 Unless the gun was slanted up . <eos>
 So the wound and the shell give you the same answer . <eos>
 I guess I am just ballast around here . <eos>
 Somebody did it twice last night in the dark . <eos>
 Maybe we have been pretty dumb <eos>
 There was not any motive . let s try out the act . <eos>
 I think so . <eos>
 Where s the shell ? <eos>
 Should be over there . <eos>
 You can find out . <eos>
 You have got a dead man on your hands . Like this . <eos>
 Well . What about it ? <eos>
 Did we ever really think it was suicide ? <eos>
 Oh nothing . <eos>
 Are you always this witty ? <eos>
 Warm water no doubt . <eos>
 Positive ? <eos>
 Not quiet yet . <eos>
 Did you ever have a serious operation ? <eos>
 Mortar shells are not funny either . <eos>
 It does . May I go now ? <eos>
 I will investigate Mr . Clarendon s financial position <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems . <eos>
 Now you are being beastly . <eos>
 How about Magruder ? <eos>
 He checks too . <eos>
 That leaves two strangers . <eos>
 So far . <eos>
 Try Betty Mayfield . The Mitchell case . <eos>
 Mayfield ? She fit into this ? <eos>
 She might . <eos>
 The card says so does not it ? <eos>
 Brandon handled the money envelope . <eos>
 I hear she s a very pretty girl . <eos>
 Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment . <eos>
 Aye . You have a point there . <eos>
 A little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either . <eos>
 Well find out . Who s covering her ? <eos>
 Nobody s covering her I detached the officer assigned to that duty . <eos>
 But you still think she s innocent . <eos>
 I do . <eos>
 Two . <eos>
 What are my orders sir ? <eos>
 Who s the girl ? <eos>
 Her name s Mayfield . Betty Mayfield . <eos>
 Nice . <eos>
 You should not . You washed me up very thoroughly . <eos>
 You ought to know why . <eos>
 You would go to jail . For a long term . <eos>
 You do not have to make a pose of it . <eos>
 That s not very kind . <eos>
 What does it look like ? <eos>
 How long have you had it ? <eos>
 Years why ? <eos>
 I did not mean it that way I am sorry . <eos>
 How about your new friend ? <eos>
 I told you she s just . <eos>
 In an hour Larry . <eos>
 I have no intension of being nasty Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 I say YES ! <eos>
 Unsophisticated ? If I knew about this babe . <eos>
 It s kind of you to see me . <eos>
 He was delightful . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Good . Suez was a minefield for both parties . <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 I think you will do very well . <eos>
 It s a pity she could not make it up here today . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 We will see you next week and if <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Sit on that log dear . <eos>
 Penfield . James Penfield . <eos>
 Keep me company . <eos>
 Exactly that . <eos>
 Do not tell me you have actually read it Jeremy . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 A glamorous young lady way above his station . <eos>
 No thanks . I would like to break away <eos>
 I will have some of that . <eos>
 . break away completely from <eos>
 And some of that . Sorry . <eos>
 No . I would want to <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 Yes please . <eos>
 And you will join me in a sambucca ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 That s her . <eos>
 I quite liked it . I was not as enthusiastic as everyone else . <eos>
 I thought it was tremendous . <eos>
 I think it went on rather too long . <eos>
 I could not bear for it to end . <eos>
 And I did not like that man . <eos>
 Oh but he was terrific . <eos>
 And the shape of it all . It was sort of . shapeless . <eos>
 Really ? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good . <eos>
 You do not like flashbacks because your mother s a historian . <eos>
 My real father ? Well he was a flashback . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 I called you a taxi . <eos>
 Very thoughtful . <eos>
 Well you know . <eos>
 Yes if you like . Call me at work . <eos>
 I have to be up early . <eos>
 Me too . <eos>
 Two or three years ago I would have stayed . And fucked you . <eos>
 Too late . Just my luck . <eos>
 I bet . Thanks for the drink . <eos>
 You just might . <eos>
 Did she talk about me ? <eos>
 No . We talked about history and Siberian Geese . <eos>
 Well you should . <eos>
 I might . <eos>
 Might ? <eos>
 Yes . Might . Remember you are here to talk to my mother . <eos>

 Are you up to something ? <eos>
 Fuck off . <eos>

 Without calling me ? <eos>
 In a hurry . <eos>
 Who s he ? <eos>

 Someone was at that window . I saw the curtain move . <eos>

 Do we simply ask him where he s hidden it ? <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Bates . <eos>

 We could laze around here a while longer . <eos>
 You sure talk like a girl who s been married . <eos>

 Not in mine . <eos>
 What makes you think we are here to meet you ? <eos>
 Who else would you be ? <eos>
 I know cops and you are no cop . <eos>
 No thanks . <eos>

 To see a man about a thing . <eos>
 I can do that . <eos>
 That s what I thought . <eos>
 As in they own it ? <eos>
 Something like that . <eos>
 I do not . But the language he s speaking s universal . <eos>
 I asked if we could give him anything else . <eos>
 Jujitsu . <eos>
 Same thing s not it ? <eos>
 Not at all . Similar but not the same . <eos>
 What s the difference ? <eos>
 One s a lot more painful than the other . <eos>

 Parting s such sweet sorrow <eos>
 Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer . <eos>
 Then have my lips the sin that they have took . <eos>
 She speaks . <eos>
 What satisfaction can st thou have tonight ? <eos>
 The exchange of thy love s faithful vow for mine . <eos>
 Is she obedient ? <eos>

 Looking after it he s probably fucking well eating it . <eos>
 What are you doing here ? <eos>

 A vote ? <eos>
 The majority has spoken . <eos>
 You have a phone call . <eos>

 I must go where I can be of use . <eos>
 Good day . <eos>

 Even nuns have to pee . <eos>
 Hail Mary . <eos>
 Jerusalem s a real drag . Everybody hates me . <eos>

 People throw stones . They call me names . I mean really . <eos>
 Really . <eos>
 But wait . <eos>
 A hiding place . <eos>
 They open a window . <eos>
 You wo not even tell us ? <eos>

 You found him but we are not open yet . <eos>
 Who are you guys ? <eos>
 We did not tell you what ? <eos>
 I am telling you ! <eos>
 Maybe . <eos>
 Take care of it . <eos>
 It s a bluff Vince . <eos>
 Not . totally . <eos>
 What s the problem ? <eos>
 It did not work Vince . <eos>
 You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot . <eos>
 So take it off . <eos>
 Which one ! <eos>
 Which one ? <eos>
 Willy hit the lights . <eos>
 Where s she ? <eos>
 She s a broad ! Got it ! Just some broad ! <eos>
 Forget her ! We got the one we need ! Step on it ! <eos>
 No smart ass remarks or nothing . <eos>
 Neither did you ! <eos>
 I figured if you were gonna then I would not have to . <eos>
 That s what I figured too . <eos>
 For like twelve zillion eternities ? <eos>
 And then we can ice her . No nun no evil eye . <eos>
 She s praying . <eos>
 Is it worth it ? A lot of witnesses here . <eos>
 Dress rehearsal at four performance at 8 30 . Sharp . <eos>
 We are losing it . <eos>
 That should have tipped us . <eos>
 We can not leave it up to the Feds ! <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Oh she s doing just fine Reverend Mother <eos>
 But why would anyone kidnap a nun ? <eos>
 However we can also pray for other things . <eos>
 Measles . <eos>
 Which convent was that Sister ? <eos>
 That was exciting ! <eos>
 He s decent . <eos>
 He s kind . <eos>
 It s better than ice cream . <eos>
 It s better than springtime . <eos>
 It s brought people back to the church . <eos>
 Mary Clarence you should not have . Where did you get this ? <eos>
 It s no use . She just s not here . <eos>
 We will pray and she will be there . <eos>
 Yes two men and they had guns . <eos>
 She was not a nun ? <eos>
 And what a lovely name . Las Vegas . <eos>
 But how do we get there ? <eos>
 A Benedictine . <eos>
 Christy . <eos>
 Impossible . <eos>
 But where ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 She did . Bring her back . Now . For a talk . <eos>
 It s that call you were expecting Vince . <eos>
 Can you hold ? Can you try ? <eos>
 Okay so the problem s still the nun outfit right ? <eos>
 Find em ! <eos>
 Many have . <eos>
 Then name one person who has seen him with their own eyes . <eos>
 Well enough . Your gathering does honor to the deceased . <eos>
 Excuse me Miss . They have a laugh at your expense . <eos>
 Well unless your name s Baltus you should not worry over mine . <eos>
 Two days . ? For murder ? <eos>
 You must have missed your mark . <eos>
 I hit him square . <eos>
 I say s there any one person suspect in these acts ? <eos>
 I was afraid of this . <eos>
 To place it inside its coffin . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 What are you spying on ? <eos>
 The Lenape . He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time . <eos>
 A diseased monster . <eos>
 . Brom Bones . <eos>
 You need to sleep . <eos>
 Bring him . <eos>
 You need rest . <eos>
 You will stay at her side ? <eos>
 Would you stay doctor ? I may need assistance . <eos>
 What of it ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims . <eos>
 Protest to my superiors if you like . <eos>
 Your superiors are two days away ! <eos>
 I am the Lord s voice in this town . <eos>
 Wallowing in sin and lust . <eos>
 They need guidance . <eos>
 Wallowing quite literally in blood . <eos>
 Damn you sir ! God damn you to hell ! <eos>
 Pardon me ? <eos>
 I have everything . last testaments . birth certificates death certificates . deeds . <eos>
 Yes sir . but do you have these ? <eos>
 Hmm ? See them ? <eos>
 May we look at them now ? <eos>
 A fine idea . <eos>
 Master Hardenbrook . <eos>
 Well . that might be . helpful . <eos>
 Without disrespect look around you . We overflow . As do our courts . <eos>
 Not Liberalism . Equanimity . <eos>
 These methods of yours . there has been no practical application . <eos>
 Not for lack of trying . <eos>
 Excellent . Then you are excused till morning . <eos>
 Is that all you say ? Look at her . <eos>
 It s not something people speak of openly . She did not remarry . <eos>
 Whatever . You still need a second to tend to your things . <eos>
 I manage fine alone . <eos>
 I am sure I do not know . <eos>
 We must discover it . The reason the murderer chose these persons . <eos>
 How could he ? <eos>
 Up . <eos>
 The Western Woods . <eos>
 Look again . <eos>
 What kind of nuts ? <eos>
 Not for eating I assure you . Watch here . <eos>
 Yes . I suppose it is . Keep it . <eos>
 No I could not . <eos>
 I have others . All I need s this . <eos>
 Now hold the bowl steady . Back to business . <eos>
 Witches do not exist . However . <eos>
 Listen . <eos>
 I hear nothing . <eos>
 No crickets or cicadas calling . No bird songs . <eos>
 What happened ? <eos>
 Should we go back ? <eos>
 True enough . <eos>
 Then who murdered the Old Crone ? And why ? <eos>
 Good questions deserving answers of which we are in short supply . <eos>
 Stay back . <eos>
 We should go . <eos>
 Why this tree ? <eos>
 All I saw was their lantern . <eos>
 Business best hidden s hidden best at night . <eos>
 But if the farm s not mine who stole it away ? <eos>
 No one yet far as I can tell . It has gone intestate . <eos>
 In test . what ? <eos>
 Did your father take a loan ? <eos>
 Yes . I rode with him on payment days . <eos>
 Lady Van Tassel . <eos>
 What was she doing ? <eos>
 You do not know all that has happened . You cannot understand . <eos>
 Take me with you . There s nothing left for me here . <eos>
 Lady Van Tassel . <eos>
 I know . Hold on . <eos>
 Take the reins . <eos>
 I doubt that s the end . <eos>
 Tired . <eos>
 I . I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel . <eos>
 You are horribly old fashioned are not you ? <eos>
 Small talk . <eos>
 It might have been more . Might have been positively grand talk . <eos>
 You are funny . <eos>
 May I ask . why do you cover your book that way ? <eos>
 I have had them since childhood . I cannot remember what from . <eos>
 It would be interesting to find out . <eos>
 You made this and the drawings ? <eos>
 If you want . But . <eos>
 I insist that you have it . <eos>
 Very well . But it will only sit gathering dust . <eos>
 If these are the random stalkings of a monster what good am I ? <eos>
 People have put their trust in you . <eos>
 They have done nothing of the sort . <eos>
 No stone may be left unturned . It may appear harsh . <eos>
 It was not butchery . <eos>
 But why ? Tell me why . <eos>
 She s not your birth mother s she ? <eos>
 No but . why do you ask that ? <eos>
 What happened to your mother ? Is she still alive ? <eos>
 Katrina . Why do you follow ? <eos>
 I apologize if I worried you . <eos>
 A woman should not be out alone in these woods . <eos>
 What did you say ? <eos>
 Just . keep where you are . <eos>
 He . he tries to take the heads . they will not pass . <eos>
 The skull s gone . <eos>
 Yes . I did notice that thank you . <eos>
 I am drawing bad blood from the wound . <eos>
 Come with me . <eos>
 I have not been able to face him yet . <eos>
 What would you have me believe ? <eos>
 If you think I am behind this say it . <eos>
 The name Van Tassel s blackened . You share that name . <eos>
 I do not know . Away . <eos>
 He moves too fast . <eos>
 His horse . <eos>
 Keep climbing . I will follow . <eos>
 We have no choice . <eos>

 How long will that be ? <eos>
 Two and a half days ? <eos>
 Yeah . I heard you . <eos>
 But she s <eos>
 Nobody move ! <eos>
 Shut up Beth . I do not want to hear it . <eos>
 What was that ? <eos>
 Fifty yards and closing . <eos>
 What do we use for defense ? <eos>
 But you have tested it ? <eos>
 Sure . Each time it started fires inside the habitat . <eos>
 Thirty yards . <eos>
 What are you saying we can not stop what s out there ? <eos>
 Why can not I ? What the hell s going on here ? <eos>
 He s right beneath us . <eos>

 Storm ? What storm ? <eos>
 A thousand feet . <eos>

 Something like that . That does not surprise you ? <eos>
 Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year <eos>
 Wait a second <eos>

 It s impossible . <eos>
 What s wrong with oxygen ? <eos>

 What ? <eos>
 Or maybe it can not u be u killed . <eos>
 You mean what s in that thing s immortal ? <eos>

 Everything can be killed . <eos>
 Just worry about yourself . <eos>

 I told you people nobody goes anywhere unless I say . <eos>

 I think I do . <eos>
 She put a razor to her wrists a day later . <eos>
 When was this ? <eos>
 Wait a second <eos>
 and then brought her down here <eos>
 I did not know it would come to this <eos>
 That s smart . Let s talk about guns and violence . <eos>
 You do not think weapons are important ? <eos>
 I think we should be careful . Consider his emotional response . <eos>
 Because if Jerry s powerful and also emotional . <eos>
 Damn it Edmunds ? <eos>
 Jerry ? <eos>
 Jerry ? Please . Stop this . <eos>
 Ted go into the control room . Listen for my instructions . <eos>
 You see the lever on the green box ? Upper right hand corner ? <eos>
 Pull it . <eos>

 To the craft ? None . Not a scratch . <eos>
 Chipped ? The door ? How can it be chipped ? <eos>
 I do not know how it can be chipped but it s chipped . <eos>
 I thought you said there was not any damage done in the crash ? <eos>
 I did . <eos>
 Then how can it be chipped ? <eos>
 Yes Harry . <eos>
 We know how this craft got here . Where it s been . <eos>
 To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere . <eos>
 A break for what ? <eos>
 Ted seems to have some ideas . <eos>
 Ladies and Gentlemen . <eos>
 Who s that ? Where s that coming from ? <eos>
 Please watch your closest monitor . <eos>
 I have to tell you . It s strange . <eos>
 How do you mean strange ? <eos>
 It s not ignorant . <eos>
 What you want me to retype it ? <eos>
 She wired this system . <eos>
 The wing dimension alone s larger that any aircraft we have seen . <eos>
 Duly noted Ted . Edmunds try using suction . <eos>

 What s it ? <eos>
 Radiation shield you think ? <eos>
 What do you make of this ? <eos>
 Sir about leaving <eos>
 To what ? <eos>
 Internal power . <eos>
 What s inside the sphere . <eos>
 The sensors are picking up something outside . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Too big ? <eos>
 What was Edmunds doing outside ? <eos>
 Resetting the sub . <eos>
 What sub ? <eos>
 I love secrets . <eos>
 That ULF report everybody s patting me on the back about ? <eos>
 I have read it twice Norman . It s brilliant . <eos>
 It s bullshit . The report s a joke . <eos>
 That s quite a secret . <eos>
 Because when we get down there <eos>
 Wait down where ? <eos>
 To the spacecraft . To investigate . <eos>
 Underwater ? <eos>
 What do you expect ? For them to bring it up here ? <eos>
 Yeah . Drowning . <eos>
 No . Go ahead . Really . Ladies first . <eos>
 Such a gentlemen when you are scared shitless . <eos>

 Disrupt our brain waves interfere with our ability to think . <eos>

 You are jumping to conclusions Beth . Do not get worked up <eos>
 Fuck you Norman ! It s right here . <eos>

 Do not bother me Norman . <eos>
 It s not worth the risk . <eos>
 You me and Harry . He s asleep . <eos>
 Wake him then . Let s go . Get outta <eos>
 Why should I go ? <eos>
 You should know how it works . Just in case . <eos>
 In case you die too ? <eos>
 I do not trust Harry to do it . <eos>
 I would . But my suit <eos>
 I fixed your suit . <eos>
 You do not trust me ? <eos>
 But I do not know how <eos>
 Still clear . <eos>
 You fixed this suit ? Beth ? <eos>
 Yes Norman . I did . You are just nervous . <eos>

 You do not believe me . <eos>
 All I know s I opened that refridgerator <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Page 87 . I could never read that far . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 He acquired some sort of power . A power to manifest things . <eos>
 But how ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 How can the sphere do that ? <eos>
 Why would Harry go back to using a code ? <eos>
 Something for burns . <eos>
 Ephedrine hydrochloride . <eos>
 Valdomet . <eos>
 Ulcers . <eos>
 Sintag . <eos>
 A synthetic opium analogue . <eos>
 Tarazine ? <eos>
 Tranquilizer . Causes drowsiness . <eos>

 Antihistamine . For bites . <eos>
 Damn it ! Chloramphenicol ? <eos>
 Antibiotic . <eos>
 Parasolutrine ? <eos>
 How do you spell it ? <eos>
 P a r a s o . <eos>
 It s a soporific . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>

 I will just boost the doses . <eos>
 What ? Wait s not that dangerous ? <eos>
 How fast does it take effect ? <eos>
 Does not say . <eos>

 Thirty years ago . In residency . I passed out . You ? <eos>
 Only lab rats . Here . <eos>

 You do not think I put something in it do you ? <eos>
 Snakes ? What do you mean exactly ? <eos>

 Do you fear them ? <eos>
 Do not you ? <eos>
 Are you manifesting them ? <eos>
 What s the phrase keeping up with the Joneses ? <eos>
 Why did you go in the sphere Beth ? <eos>
 No he s not . <eos>
 He can not manifest . <eos>

 How s that ? <eos>
 What s that mistake number two Norman ? <eos>
 Well think . Because there s footprints here that are not mine . <eos>
 Well they are not mine . <eos>
 It does not make any sense . <eos>
 By the bunks . <eos>
 Who says it s a he ? <eos>
 For whoever s in that thing . <eos>
 You would have to ask them . <eos>
 It s an American spacecraft . <eos>
 Harry ? That s bullshit . We stood right there <eos>
 That s a hell of a mistake to make Beth . <eos>
 I am sorry . Slip of the tongue . <eos>
 Yeah I do not know how you could make that confusion . <eos>
 In time for what ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Just in time for what ? <eos>
 Another attack ? <eos>
 Like what ? I am not <eos>
 You are staring at me . <eos>

 What are you still doing here ? <eos>
 You remember opening the door ? <eos>
 Then explain it to me . <eos>
 What s it Harry ? <eos>
 What happens on page 87 ? Have you ever read page 87 ? <eos>
 Page 87 of what Harry ? <eos>
 I could never read that far . I never wanted to . <eos>
 That far in what Harry ? <eos>
 There s some sort of pattern here . It will take a minute . <eos>
 You do not remember that ? <eos>
 Harry ? <eos>
 Norman where are you ? <eos>
 I can not breathe . Am I . clear ? <eos>
 You are clear . You see the airlock ? <eos>
 What happened to her ? <eos>
 What do you mean ? She s not here ? <eos>
 When I woke up nobody was here . <eos>
 She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me . <eos>
 Her suit s gone . <eos>
 Beth left ? <eos>
 I thought she was with you . <eos>
 You did not say that about the food ? <eos>
 She s lying Norman . Just like she lied about fixing your suit . <eos>
 Wisconsin ? <eos>
 Navy transmission . They are sent from Wisconsin . <eos>
 How do we decode it ? <eos>
 Do not have to . Watch . It will do it for you . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag ? <eos>
 You know what it s Harry . <eos>
 Stop what ? What are you ? <eos>
 I do not think so . <eos>
 I could hit her a little harder . More toward the cranium . <eos>
 Help me lift her . <eos>
 Shut up and open the door . <eos>
 Two and a half minutes . Once we are in the sub . <eos>
 How far away s the sub ? <eos>
 Hold on . <eos>
 I am trying . Shit . Here catch her . <eos>
 Are you trying damn it ? Just <eos>
 Hurry Norman . Four minutes . <eos>

 Her legs are in the way . <eos>

 I am trying . There . <eos>
 No idea . <eos>
 Well press something ! <eos>
 Wait ! <eos>
 Nine hundred feet to surface . <eos>
 We all kill ourselves ? Bad joke . Sorry Beth . <eos>
 It would erase all our knowledge of it . All of our power . <eos>
 What s it Harry ? <eos>
 Just one of Norman s many secrets . <eos>
 Gimme some room here will you ? Back off . Gimme some space . <eos>
 Shutup Ted . You did not notice shit . Keep hammering . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Is it some sort of joke ? Like one of those hoaxes ? <eos>
 Is it ? <eos>
 Think about it . <eos>
 Gimme a minute here . I think I have got it . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 If it s an alien spacecraft <eos>
 Save your breath . It s not an alien spacecraft . <eos>
 Meaning it did not land in the water . <eos>
 Please . It must have flown here <eos>
 It did not fly here . It u arrived u here . <eos>
 Arrived ? From where ? <eos>
 Not where . When . 400 years ago . From our future . <eos>
 Impotent ? I am not impotent . <eos>
 We are friends . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Does this mean what I think it means ? <eos>
 It s over sir The storm has cleared . <eos>
 The ships ? <eos>
 They are topside . We are ready to take you home sir . <eos>

 Beth and Harry ? <eos>
 They are in the sub sir . Waiting . <eos>
 Just that . Careful it s heavy . <eos>
 No they did not say <eos>
 This way sir . <eos>
 Captain who ? <eos>
 You mean they have not told you yet ? <eos>
 Told me what ? <eos>
 You have heard of me ? <eos>
 Well everybody s been talking about that report you wrote . <eos>
 What report ? <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 What report ? <eos>
 You mean you do not know ? <eos>
 Know what ? <eos>
 Physicists mathematicians geologists you name it . <eos>
 Geologists ? At a plane crash ? <eos>
 Strange s not it ? In the middle of the ocean no less . <eos>
 What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash ? <eos>
 He s a pussy . <eos>
 You are a 53 year old shrink what are you gonna do ? <eos>
 Earth does not have a patent on buttons Ted . <eos>
 Still make a note I recognized that . <eos>
 You mean a picture ? <eos>
 Squint harder . <eos>
 Please Ted . <eos>
 Try this one . <eos>
 This s like nursery school . <eos>
 Do not you see it ? It s a picture of the creature . <eos>
 The creature ? <eos>
 Unless it s an act . <eos>
 Barnes did not know . Could not get a reading . <eos>
 Has Harry spoken with Jerry ? <eos>
 Not that I know of . Why ? <eos>
 You seen my suitcase ? <eos>
 Well I can not imagine five years of unemployment <eos>
 Four . Four years <eos>
 Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume . <eos>
 Keep watching the news . Are you watching the news ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Was it a military crash ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 They never used to send a Navy car . <eos>
 Who s going to pay me then ? <eos>
 I think there are some things we should talk about . <eos>
 I am beginning not to like you . <eos>
 I am not afraid of anything . <eos>
 Not bad . <eos>
 May the Force be with you . <eos>
 Could not we have tried to think of something else first ! <eos>
 Oh so you are a warrior then ? <eos>
 Of course . I am a Bendu officer . <eos>
 You saw through me ? <eos>
 You could put it that way . <eos>
 I assure you my intentions were not bad . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 I had one but it was taken at the battle of Condawn . <eos>
 That s where my father was killed . <eos>
 They use the Bogan Force . <eos>
 Keep away I am fine I am fine . <eos>
 He can not find Organa Major . <eos>
 You mean we should go after her ! <eos>
 I did not say that but it appears to be a logical alternative . <eos>
 Try to feel it . Use the Force . <eos>
 I can not do it . I will get hit . <eos>
 Stop thinking and start feeling . Let yourself go . <eos>
 You look great ! The uniform and everything ! <eos>
 But there was a lot of firing earlier . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 Have you been checked out ? <eos>
 I have got it blocked . I am all right . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Forget it son . <eos>
 Should we alert the Sith Lords ? <eos>
 I will make a report later . <eos>
 Was this trip really necessary ? <eos>
 The fourth moon of Yavin . I have given the coordinates to Chewbacca . <eos>
 I would better go see how he s doing . <eos>
 It s automatic . <eos>
 What are you saying ? <eos>
 You are good with are motes but how are you against something living ? <eos>
 I do not know . I have never fought anyone . <eos>

 Hi Artie . <eos>
 Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours ? <eos>
 In a deep freeze . <eos>
 Let it ride for a while . <eos>
 You are going to stay are not you ? <eos>
 That was the general idea . <eos>
 Come on . <eos>
 Close but no cigar . <eos>
 Where s the bar ? <eos>
 I mean could you put me up for a couple of weeks ? <eos>
 It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch . <eos>
 I will take it . <eos>
 I will have the bell hop take care of your luggage . <eos>
 It s from hunger . <eos>
 Nothing for Ladd ? <eos>
 Just a rehash of something that was not very good to begin with . <eos>
 I just think pictures should say a little something . <eos>
 Sure . Bases Loaded . <eos>
 About that luggage . Where s the phone ? <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 I have been hoping to run into you . <eos>
 What for ? To recover that knife you stuck in my back ? <eos>
 There s one called . Window . something with a window . <eos>
 Dark Windows . How did you like it ? <eos>
 I did not . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Except for about six pages . You have got a flashback there . <eos>
 How about the Rainbow Room ? <eos>
 I had a teacher like that once . <eos>
 Drop that attitude . Here s some thing really worth while . <eos>
 Want me to start right now ? Maybe there s some paper around . <eos>
 I am serious . I have got a few ideas . <eos>
 Well . <eos>
 Are you hungry ? <eos>
 With a wildly beating heart . <eos>
 Life can be beautiful ! <eos>
 You do not know how glad I am to see youl <eos>
 Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher . <eos>
 What teacher ? <eos>
 Dark Windows . I got him all hopped up about it . <eos>
 You did ? <eos>
 He thinks it could be made into something . <eos>
 Into what ? A lampshade ? <eos>
 I tell you this s half sold . <eos>
 As a matter of fact . I have given up writing altogether . <eos>
 You sure have . <eos>
 So long . <eos>
 Sorry . It s your baby now . <eos>
 We are engaged . <eos>
 Good for you . You have got yourself the best guy in town . <eos>
 Nobody can be that busy . <eos>
 You are tough all right . <eos>
 So do I . <eos>
 Came on back . Let me show you where it fits in . <eos>
 And here s a title AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER . <eos>
 What s good about it ? I miss him something fierce . <eos>
 I mean this s good dialogue along in here . It will play . <eos>
 It will ? <eos>
 Sure . Especially with lots of music underneath drowning it out . <eos>
 Do not you sometimes hate yourself ? <eos>
 Who s who ? <eos>
 I am sorry . I do not usually read private cigarette cases . <eos>
 I gave her some advice on an idiotic script . <eos>
 Should be . It cost three hundred dollars . <eos>
 Saddest thing I ever heard . <eos>
 It must be my new shampoo . <eos>
 What s wrong with you tonight ? What s it Betty ? <eos>
 Something came up . I do not want to talk about it . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 I just do not . <eos>
 What s it you have heard . Come on let s have it . <eos>

 Nobody asked you to . <eos>
 Hello Mr . deMille . <eos>
 You would better . I am very angry . <eos>
 I am pretty busy as you can see . <eos>
 That s no excuse . You read the script did not you ? <eos>
 Yes I did . <eos>
 Do not play innocent . Somebody named Gordon Cole . <eos>
 Gordon Cole ? <eos>

 Sure . Wait a minute have not I seen you ? <eos>
 I knew there was something wrong with them . <eos>
 Get out ! <eos>

 And you have written pictures have not you ? <eos>
 And you will play Salome ? <eos>
 Who else ? <eos>
 Only asking . I did t know you were planning a comeback . <eos>
 This s fascinating . <eos>
 Of course it is . <eos>
 It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil . <eos>
 I will not have it butchered . <eos>
 What month ? <eos>
 December twenty first . <eos>
 Sagittarius . I like Sagittarians . You can trust them . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 I want you to do this work . <eos>
 Are you married Mr . ? <eos>
 The name s Gillis . I am single . <eos>
 Where do you live ? <eos>

 There s something wrong with your car you said . <eos>
 There sure is . <eos>
 You can stay here . <eos>
 I will come early tomorrow . <eos>
 Thanks for the invitation but I have my own apartment . <eos>
 You can not work in an apartment where you owe three months rent . <eos>
 I will take care of that . <eos>
 It s all taken care of . It s all paid for . <eos>
 I am used to paying my own bills . <eos>
 You proud boy why did not you tell me you were having difficulties . <eos>
 Okay . We will deduct it from my salary . <eos>
 Just a scene I cut out . <eos>
 What scene ? <eos>
 Not now my dear . I am playing three no trump . <eos>
 They have come for my car . <eos>
 Please . Now I have forgotten how many spades are out . <eos>

 Oh . and I thought it was a matter of life and death . <eos>
 What s wrong with It ? <eos>
 I do not need a tuxedo . <eos>

 Tails . That s ridiculous . <eos>
  <eos>
 Come on ! <eos>

 It s those feathers . They tickle . <eos>
 The other guests ? <eos>
 A little . <eos>
 Is it funny that I am in love with you ? <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Mad about the boy . <eos>
 Norma I can not take it . You have bought me enough . <eos>
 What right do you have to take me for granted ? <eos>
 What right ? Do you want me to tell you ? <eos>
 What kind of a silly thing was that to do ? <eos>
 To fall in love with you that was the idiotic thing . <eos>
 Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being . <eos>
 This s the right day . <eos>
 They are awful . They make me cough . <eos>
 I ran into some people I knew . <eos>
 Where are my cigarettes ? <eos>
 Where are your . <eos>
 Yes Norma . <eos>
 I have lost half a pound since Tuesday . <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 You would better get to bed yourself . <eos>
 I think I will read a little . <eos>

 Why do you say that ? <eos>
 No you did not . You took the car . <eos>
 Of course you have not . I would not let you . <eos>
 No you are not . Max ! Max ! <eos>
 It s yours Joe . I gave it to you . <eos>
 You think I made that up about the gun . <eos>
 No they do not . <eos>

 Why are you so upset ? Is there anything missing ? <eos>
 Who said you could ? Who asked you to ? <eos>
 I am not here . <eos>
 That s what I told them . <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 There are no locks anywhere in this house . <eos>
 The doctor suggested it . <eos>
 What doctor ? <eos>
 You send them . Is that it Max ? <eos>

 She s upstairs . <eos>
 Right with you . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 What car ? <eos>

 You do not believe me ? Look in the garage . <eos>
 Bases Loaded . There s a 4O page outline . <eos>

 Along s no good . I need it now . <eos>
 Have not got a thing . <eos>
 Any kind of assignment . Additional Dialogue . <eos>
 There s nothing Gillis . Not even if you were a relative . <eos>
 Did you intend to kill him ? Just answer me that . <eos>
 Okay . And let s have the car right outside . <eos>
 Yes . Madame . <eos>
 You know better than to interrupt me . <eos>
 Paramount s calling . <eos>

 Paramount studios . <eos>
 Say that I am busy and hang up . <eos>
 Very good Madam . <eos>
 The cameras have arrived Madame . <eos>
 This s the staircase of the palace . <eos>
 But the phantom Zone s for criminals . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 The Coffer of Shadow . Look at it . <eos>
 The danger . The one Nigel spoke of . It must be near . <eos>
 Softball . <eos>
 But which one ? <eos>
 Drive on . We have already attracted enough attention . <eos>
 He will be . In about five minutes . <eos>
 Have fun . <eos>
 It s what we were warned about . <eos>
 No a super girl . <eos>
 Eliminate her . <eos>
 That s easy for you to say Bianca . <eos>
 You can do it . You are the most powerful woman on Earth . <eos>
 Am I ? Still ? <eos>
 Yes of course it was foolish of me . <eos>
 Whatever you say . <eos>
 Yes . Whatever I say . From now on . <eos>
 Shut up and get me a hacksaw . <eos>
 She did not take it from you did she ? <eos>
 That little girl ? Ha . Now go on get me some tools . <eos>
 There s no need . I learned the Craft from my <eos>
 And the first thing we do s get rid of Supergirl ! <eos>
 What do you mean we ? <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 Western Europe . <eos>
 It s a warning that s for sure . <eos>
 Maybe it was just an accident . <eos>
 It s for your own protection . <eos>
 I am taking you to the hospital . <eos>
 Let me out . I have to talk to you . <eos>
 Later . <eos>
 I have to . <eos>
 When can I see you again ? <eos>
 Relax . Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream . Goodbye . <eos>
 Who did not ? <eos>
 I know just the place . Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower . <eos>
 Are you sure it s all right for us to be here ? <eos>
 They do not care they are tearing it down for a shopping centre . <eos>
 Yes . It reminds me of home . <eos>
 Where Superman s from ? Krypton ? <eos>
 Ethan tell me more about this woman who s after you . <eos>
 Let s talk about us not her . <eos>
 Tell me where I can find her . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 We are from different worlds . <eos>
 You do not like me ? You hate me ? <eos>
 What do you feel about me ? <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Let me kiss you . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 You are not afraid are you ? <eos>
 Of course not but . there are things we do not understand . <eos>
 Terrific . <eos>
 It s paradise . We could be very happy here . <eos>
 What would not last ? What s the matter with you ? <eos>
 Just like that ? <eos>
 Like turning off a light . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said . <eos>
 I sort of like what you said . <eos>
 That makes it worse . <eos>
 But I do not understand . <eos>
 Hello . Are you still mad at me ? <eos>
 I am not mad at you . <eos>
 It seemed that way to me . <eos>
 I do not see why not . <eos>
 But what if it was not real ? <eos>
 Feelings are real . Once you have had them they are yours forever . <eos>
 She will forget about us eventually . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Just one kiss . For old times sake . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 She has hostages . <eos>
 How do I fight it ? <eos>
 Turn it against her . <eos>
 Do you want to come to Argo City ? <eos>
 Hmmm ? <eos>
 Remember me ? We were in a disaster together . <eos>
 I did . <eos>
 Well thanks a pile fella . <eos>
 Well there s several ways to go . <eos>
 Come in have a drink we will talk . <eos>
 What s that big black scar on the ground ? Like a fire . <eos>
 Oh you know how parties are . Always some damage . <eos>
 A passionfruit smoothee . <eos>
 Well just one . <eos>
 I will drink to that . <eos>
 What an adorable hat . <eos>
 They think I have a concussion . <eos>
 And you think you are in love . <eos>
 I know it . <eos>
 Forget her you are mine . I saw you first . <eos>
 Come back to my house . My car s outside . <eos>
 I could force you . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 I do not know . You seem afraid . <eos>
 You are a regular Einstein are not you ? <eos>
 Supergirl ? <eos>
 Well . I guess I can not . <eos>
 I am ready for her . I will show you . <eos>
 I have got things to do . <eos>
 What about my proposal ? <eos>

 I knew it ! He s working on a hot scoop ! <eos>
 Oh no thanks . <eos>
 The scoop of the year ! <eos>
 Oh sure . <eos>
 I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building . <eos>
 Did anybody notice you ? <eos>
 I can not help it if men notice me . <eos>
 Lucy ! Be serious . We could be executed for treason ! <eos>
 Why did not you tell me ? <eos>
 You are supposed to guess . <eos>
 Years ago . And it was Zaltar who stole it . <eos>
 I allowed it to escape the City . <eos>
 As brave as my father . As wise . <eos>
 It s going to be a tree I think . <eos>
 Did not you study six dimensional geometry in school ? <eos>
 Wait till you are older . Here watch this . <eos>
 Can you create life ? <eos>
 No sweat . When s the rest of your stuff arriving ? <eos>
 This s all your clothes ? <eos>
 I would rather not talk about it . <eos>
 You are not . an orphan are you ? <eos>
 My cousin Clark s my only relative on Earth . <eos>
 She s a beast . <eos>
 Must have been a defective puck . <eos>
 But what for ? <eos>
 She just hates anybody who s not afraid of her . <eos>
 It was just a trim . <eos>
 You sure ? <eos>
 I dunno but he s gonna get creamed . <eos>
 Somebody s gotta do something ! <eos>
 Nice ? He s cute enough to melt lead ! <eos>
 I have to get back . I am having dinner with the Danvers . <eos>
 Oh yes . Knocking . The pre entry signal . I forgot . <eos>
 I am Linda Lee . <eos>
 No MR . Danvers . <eos>
 Sure . Mate in five moves . <eos>
 You Scorpios can never take a joke . <eos>
 I have to talk to you . <eos>
 You are wasting your breath . <eos>
 Such a shame . You ought to take better care of yourself . <eos>
 Thank you . I am going to close this up again . <eos>
 A cheap trick . <eos>
 Cheap but effective . <eos>
 It s just one more crime you will have to pay for . <eos>
 Not yet . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 It s the most beautiful place in the universe . <eos>
 Sounds O . K . to me . Let s go . <eos>
 It s everywhere . But water s always the door . <eos>
 That s home . <eos>
 Earth ? You crossed the dimension barrier ? By yourself ? <eos>
 Yes . I went there to find the lost Power Source . <eos>
 Criminals . <eos>
 What ? Palace ? Hardly . <eos>
 Just feels a little like a tiny bit of Argo City . <eos>
 The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere . If you have the right tools . <eos>
 Of course my dear . What can I do ? <eos>
 No that s not true there s well . no <eos>
 I knew it ! <eos>
 But it s impossible . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Leave the zone ? What would I do on Earth ? <eos>
 Going to try . Did not say I could . <eos>
 Better than when I was a child . <eos>
 Do not stop . Keep moving . <eos>
 Yes must not stop . <eos>
 It s Selena . I am getting so I can recognise her work . <eos>
 Too late . Too late . Save yourself . <eos>
 Zaltar ! <eos>
 Buddy are we in trouble . <eos>
 Good lord fella ! I am talking about your boss . <eos>

 And my leopard maybe he hurt the first girl but no more . <eos>
 They do not say it to me . <eos>

 But how do you know what you hear s the truth ? <eos>
 I do not know it . I feel it . <eos>
 You make it sound so simple . <eos>
 Jeanne . I believe in you . more than anyone . <eos>
 Tell the king to give me more men . <eos>
 To marry you . <eos>
 To be killed in battle ? <eos>
 It would not be the same without you . <eos>
 Not yet ! <eos>
 Do as I say ! <eos>
 I want to stay with you . <eos>

 We have to press home the attack ! <eos>
 Sound the retreat . <eos>
 But I promised Jeanne we would fight on ! <eos>
 I made no such promise . Sound the retreat for the night ! <eos>
 But that was her order ! <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Did God forbid you to tell the truth ? <eos>
 I tried to . <eos>
 It was on a Sunday was not it ? <eos>
 I do not remember . Maybe . <eos>
 That s not what s written in the evidence . look for yourself ! <eos>
 Quite a few . <eos>
 Did not you also carry a banner ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Which did you prefer your banner or your sword ? <eos>
 I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword . <eos>
 And why was that ? Did it have some particular value or power ? <eos>
 No it s just . a sword s a weapon . <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 And so I . I prefer my banner . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 To avoid killing anyone . <eos>
 So sometimes you were carrying just your sword ? <eos>
 Yes but . <eos>
 Did you use the sword that you held in your hand ? <eos>
 No I . I held it up to . <eos>
 Well . at the coronation of King Charles VI . <eos>
 Thirty years ago ? I am not surprised it s gone . <eos>
 Performing a miracle . <eos>
 But we can not do that unless she admits to blasphemy . <eos>
 Dead you are worthless darling . <eos>
 Where . where am I ? <eos>
 Guess . <eos>
 And God who allowed you to be caught ? <eos>
 No no I am fine really . <eos>
 What about you ? <eos>
 I will be right here . I promise . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 Your trial Jeanne . On a charge of heresy . <eos>
 But . the King my king did not he pay my ransom ? <eos>
 It seems that the English care more about you than the French . <eos>
 The English ? <eos>
 In a village called Domremy . <eos>
 How old are you ? <eos>
 Nineteen . or thereabouts . <eos>
 Were you baptized ? <eos>
 Yes . In the church at Domremy . <eos>

 When exactly ? A day a week when ? <eos>
 Last night . <eos>
 Praying . <eos>
 The voice was in your cell ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What did it tell you ? <eos>
 Many things . <eos>

 Yes . <eos>
 Is it here ? Now ? In this room ? <eos>
 And may I go to Mass ? <eos>
 As often as you like now please for the love of God sign ! <eos>
 You have nothing to regret . <eos>
 Thanks be to God . <eos>
 And your Duke ? The Duke of Bedford ? <eos>
 Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions ? <eos>
 You really think she s been sent . by God ? <eos>
 Then her faith will have to be bigger . <eos>
 I am . I am not the king . <eos>
 I know you are not yet but you will be soon . <eos>
 . and my crown does not fit and . Really ? <eos>
 So how would you put it ? <eos>
 My dear loyal Tremoille I know I can count on you . <eos>
 . as always majesty . <eos>
 Then why did your king believe in you without any proof ? <eos>
 Go and ask him yourself . <eos>
 Does he have hair ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Is it long and hanging down ? <eos>
 I am more interested in what he says not what he looks like . <eos>
 That s not a lot . <eos>
 20000 gold crowns . <eos>
 Yes . they were . <eos>
 Good . Where are the English ? <eos>
 Everywhere . Where s the food ? <eos>
 Good . Can you bring me to him ? <eos>
 He s on the other side of the river . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 Can we uh discuss this later ? <eos>
 Sooner s better than later ! <eos>
 The wind will be with us ! Do as I say . <eos>
 We are taking back the Tourelles ! <eos>
 We need another ten minutes . <eos>
 The bridge wo not wait ! <eos>
 Not yet . <eos>
 The English wo not wait . <eos>
 Me too . <eos>
 Yes . We can pray . <eos>
 Good idea . <eos>
 No good ? This s a disaster ! <eos>
 But the bridge has been pulled down ! <eos>
 The English are rebuilding it . <eos>
 Perfectly . <eos>
 No . not like this . <eos>
 So . bring up the reinforcements ! <eos>
 Reinforcements ? Where ? <eos>
 Jeanne look behind you . <eos>
 Never look behind only ahead ! <eos>
 Of course I do ? Bring them up ! <eos>
 The clothes are not important . <eos>
 But will you also submit to the decision of the Church ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 So when you jumped you wanted to kill yourself ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 And you did not jump of your free will ? <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Oh ? Perhaps someone pushed you then ? <eos>
 Nothing . just taking his teeth . <eos>
 But you can not just kill a man for his teeth ! <eos>
 Why not ? He has good teeth . <eos>
 Because . because you just can not ! <eos>
 Here take this instead . <eos>
 Sorry Jeanne . Did you both meet already ? <eos>
 They will and so will you if you go on swearing like that . <eos>
 God knows but it was a bad idea ! <eos>
 Were the men confessed ? Where are the priests ? <eos>
 What s the use ? The drawbridge s up ! <eos>
 Not for long . <eos>
 It s not possible . <eos>
 Jeanne . get up . this s ridiculous . <eos>
 If you kill him you kill me ! <eos>
 Yes . a half steed . white . <eos>

 How many did he give you ? <eos>
 Five steeds and a few hackneys . <eos>
 Playing . <eos>

 I do not know . please . tell me I am dead . <eos>
 WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE ? <eos>
 I . do not know . what do you want from me ? <eos>
 Nothing . I am here to set you free . <eos>
 I might ask you the same question . <eos>
 I . I am leaving . I can not take anymore . <eos>
 And what exactly s it that you can not take anymore of ? <eos>
 I told you already . I am here to set you free . <eos>

 I feel like a traitor . <eos>
 Javier Rodriguez . <eos>
 An informant . <eos>
 What s the name of your informant ? <eos>
 It was an anonymous tip . <eos>
 I am trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel . <eos>

 A small thing . Nothing really . <eos>
 Only if he can be trusted . <eos>
 He will do what I say . <eos>

 With a starship ! <eos>
 This starship could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier ? <eos>
 It could . Yes . <eos>
 Then I shall make use of this starship . <eos>

 Pavel . <eos>
 Estimating destination in 6 . 7 hours present speed . <eos>

 A Federation starship . <eos>

 Enterprise this s Starfleet Operations . Come in . <eos>

 The power was within you . <eos>

 Perhaps I have a way to bring one here . <eos>
 But how ? <eos>
 Have faith my friend . There are more of us than you know . <eos>

 Transporter room . Status . <eos>
 Go Sulu . <eos>
 Because it s there . <eos>
 Ah Captain ? <eos>
 MM . <eos>
 I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation . <eos>
 Perhaps because it s there s not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain . <eos>
 I have always known . I will die alone . <eos>
 I am preparing to toast a marsh melon . <eos>
 Are we leaving Captain ? <eos>
 I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words . <eos>
 Spock we are on leave . You can call me Jim . <eos>
 Jim . <eos>

 Life s not a dream . <eos>
 Go to sleep Spock . <eos>
 Yes Captain . <eos>
 Goodnight Bones . <eos>
 Goodnight Doctor . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Perhaps I have Captain . Perhaps I have . <eos>
 I cannot be certain . <eos>
 But he does seem familiar ? <eos>
 He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth . <eos>
 Who s it he reminds you of ? <eos>
 The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 He believed the key to self knowledge was emotion not logic . <eos>
 To land any closer would risk detection . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu . Execute . <eos>
 Yes Captain ? <eos>
 Be one with the horse . <eos>
 Yes Captain . <eos>
 Let me do something . <eos>
 Captain what have I done <eos>
 What you have done s betray every man on this ship . <eos>
 If you think it would help . <eos>
 I ordered you to defend this ship . <eos>
 You ordered me to kill my brother . <eos>
 Look the man may be a fellow Vulcan but that does not . <eos>
 I did not . <eos>
 There you see ? See ? <eos>
 I have a half brother . <eos>
 I gotta sit down . <eos>
 This s a new brig Captain . It s escape proof . <eos>

 Hmmm ? <eos>

 It s all right Captain . Proceed . <eos>
 I believe we are witnessing my birth . <eos>
 Welcome aboard Captain . <eos>
 Not possible . You were never alone . <eos>
 You staged all this to get your hands on my ship ? <eos>
 James T . Kirk Captain of the Enterprise . <eos>
 I will take you to the bridge . <eos>
 Now learn something about yourself . <eos>
 No . I refuse . <eos>
 But if we do will that convince you that my vision was true ? <eos>
 Your vision ? <eos>

 The ship needs its Captain . <eos>

 You and your pep talks . <eos>
 She smiles at everyone Ted . She s like a newborn with gas . <eos>
 One thing for sure Christy Malone s not lookin THAT good naked . <eos>
 I defy any and all limits . <eos>
 Any time any day a man can completely reinvent himself . <eos>
 Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation . <eos>
 Nobody knows about your constant masturbation . <eos>
 And nobody knows you are a virgin ! Aw who are we kidding . <eos>
 Astronomical . <eos>
 Well Dad said . <eos>
 Maybe he got promoted . <eos>

 Beauty ? No . We are talking GODDESS . <eos>
 Dead ? <eos>
 And some really fast cars . <eos>
 It s a lot to digest . Imagine how you would feel . <eos>
 . where they get all the really good porno channels on cable . <eos>
 Take a whiff of heaven . <eos>
 Sorry . Ginger got a little you know enthusiastic . <eos>
 You will never believe who s in there . <eos>
 It better not be my Aunt Trudy . <eos>
 With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip . <eos>
 No leave one . Somebody s grandmother might want one . <eos>
 Brilliant ! Molly give me all you have got . For Merk . <eos>
 Except the girl . The only one that really mattered . <eos>
 Oh god . Look . Look . <eos>
 We reinvented ourselves . <eos>
 New Hushpuppies do not make a new man . <eos>
 You have obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers . <eos>
 That explains the emptiness that haunts me . <eos>
 Jealousy s so unattractive . <eos>
 He kicked major ass and you know it . <eos>
 You go first . <eos>
 Ladies first . I insist . <eos>
 Well . The prom s coming up . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 And I was wondering . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 If you do not have . I mean . <eos>
 But that smile . <eos>
 The answer s NEVER Ted NEVER . Except maybe in your dreams . <eos>
 Yeah ? You like ? <eos>
 Makes your shoulders look so big and broad . <eos>
 Christy ? You want to be in Heaven ? <eos>
 I turned eighteen over spring break . I am eligible . <eos>
 You know . take the pictures ? <eos>
 That was code for I like you . <eos>
 I miss those days when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence . <eos>
 You have changed since second grade . <eos>
 I mean what do you think ? <eos>
 Come on I was hamburger . You were porterhouse . <eos>
 Then you better get in the water before you get burned . <eos>
 We own a small family grocery store . <eos>
 We miss our family . <eos>
 Of course we are . <eos>
 Well why should I ? <eos>
 They did do one great thing . They gave us our boy . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Be a sport . How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be ? <eos>
 I guess we could go to Disneyland or something . <eos>
 Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood . <eos>
 Like one of those National Geographic specials with the topless chicks ? <eos>
 Whatever helps you cope . <eos>
 I guess it s better than having tribal patterns carved in my face . <eos>
 There ya go . Always remember focus on the peach . <eos>
 . not the pit . <eos>
 It s okay . You need me ? <eos>
 Your mom said you have been ignoring your chores . <eos>
 I will not have my boys arguing . <eos>
 They are in the ignition silly . <eos>
 I do not have much experience with a . uh . stick . <eos>
 Want a lesson ? <eos>
 Got it . <eos>
 Some of them have to be automatics . <eos>
 The one with the horses . <eos>
 That s me . <eos>
 Shopping really ? I should tell my friend . <eos>
 Do not worry . He found the chocolate room . <eos>
 Hi ho Silver . <eos>
 What do you mean ? I am Ted Nelson . <eos>
 And who IS Ted Nelson ? <eos>
 Hmmm ? <eos>
 After graduation . maybe we could go away together ? <eos>
 Whatever you want . <eos>
 Of course we were . <eos>
 What do you want me to do ? <eos>
 This s humiliating . We are being ejected from a prom ! <eos>
 Hang in there I will think of something . <eos>
 I am Helen McDole . Your father s executive secretary . <eos>
 Your parents would be crushed to think you were not happy with it . <eos>
 Well Jay . They have been exceptionally supportive . <eos>
 Most places are Jimmy . <eos>
 My new bike . <eos>
 Very funny . <eos>
 I came to ask permission to take custody of your room . <eos>
 My room ? <eos>
 Better view more spacious new carpet . It s a no brainer . <eos>
 It s not up to me . <eos>
 You want it in writing ? <eos>
 Just a formality . <eos>
 Funny you should say that . My Grandfather was a peach farmer . <eos>
 I meant biologically . <eos>
 That s a crappy thing to say . <eos>
 Go ahead . Ask her to the prom . Get it over with . <eos>
 I have absolutely no intention <eos>
 Do it . I triple dog dare you . <eos>
 Your article sucked . <eos>
 In what sense ? <eos>
 Me ? <eos>
 Interesting . <eos>
 You never know around here . <eos>
 Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release ? <eos>
 Funny you should say peachy . <eos>
 I did my homework . Your grandfather was a peach farmer . <eos>
 My adoptive grandfather . Who knows what my biological grandfather did . <eos>
 Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort . <eos>
 See ? You are impertinent rude sarcastic . <eos>
 Second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit . <eos>
 Why can not you be nice to me ? <eos>
 You have got enough people kissing your ass . <eos>
 To the best hiding place in the world . <eos>
 He did not . He had it built . <eos>
 Whatever . <eos>
 Not whatever . It s two different things . <eos>
 He cared enough to want you to have it . <eos>
 He phoned it in . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 I doubt it . <eos>
 I mean my father . <eos>
 It s incredibly simple . <eos>
 And then what ? <eos>
 Then you will see who s really holding on to you . <eos>
 You are amazing . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Even when you infuriate me I still want to kiss you . <eos>
 But you never do . <eos>
 If we were a team we could do anything . I mean anything . <eos>
 You forget I dislike YOU at least as much as him . <eos>
 Well ? Where the hell are you ? <eos>
 He s on the move ? <eos>
 I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati . <eos>
 Let s do it . <eos>
 That has more to do with your proximity to me . <eos>
 My desire betrays me like goosebumps on my flesh . <eos>
 Shoes if you want to know the truth . Shoes are my thing . <eos>
 Wearing them ? Or humping them ? <eos>
 What about you ? <eos>
 I am very aural . <eos>
 Tell me more . <eos>
 You lose trust in someone and it s over done gone forever . <eos>
 Not a chance . <eos>
 Come on . <eos>
 Maybe someday . <eos>
 But absolutely true . <eos>
 I mean your pictorial . It bothers me profoundly . <eos>
 Aw Julie it s my job . It s like being a doctor . <eos>
 Which explains the continued success of Heaven for how many decades ? <eos>
 You are quick . I like that . <eos>
 You think you are working with chimps here ? <eos>
 The thing s I will need a first mate . <eos>
 Yellow pages ? <eos>
 Let your fingers do the walking . <eos>
 You better . <eos>
 What ? Having spring break ruined by will readings ? <eos>
 Charlie at a will reading ? What did I do to deserve this ? <eos>
 What s all this ? When are you coming home ? <eos>
 Only the best for my mother . <eos>
 You promise you will finish school ? <eos>
 I will make you very proud . <eos>
 But how would we pay our bills ? <eos>
 You are free . You can do anything you ever wanted to do ! <eos>
 Like what ? <eos>
 Forget the store . Think big . <eos>
 Oh Teddy . We missed you so much . <eos>
 Do not say shit honey . Use the strong vocabulary God gave you . <eos>
 I will be blunt . I know you can take it . <eos>
 Yes sir . I will brace myself . <eos>
 Have you ever even looked at Heaven ? <eos>
 Come on it s our only senior prom . <eos>
 Deaf ears Mr . Nelson . I answer to a higher power . <eos>
 A statue in front of city hall dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin ? <eos>
 I am warning you . <eos>
 You called the cops on us ? <eos>
 Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind . <eos>
 I have only one concern . <eos>
 Of course I like girls . <eos>
 A lot ? I mean a whole lot ? <eos>
 As much as possible . <eos>
 You are sure ? <eos>
 I . uh . I think she s doing fine on her own . <eos>
 Tipping ? <eos>
 Yeah . Everything s cool . <eos>
 YOU ? Nervous ? Why on earth should you be nervous ? <eos>
 All those people out there . It s a lot of pressure . <eos>
 Huh ! You laugh in the face of pressure ! <eos>

 The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality . <eos>
 I was like a different person tonight . <eos>
 You were the new and improved you . <eos>
 I would have been laughed right out of Xenia . <eos>
 I have been very lazy for a long long time . <eos>
 You seem like you are anything but lazy Uncle Billy . <eos>
 Really ? So I am doing OK ? <eos>
 He was in a league of his own . <eos>
 I can not wait to see the pictures . <eos>
 It was incredible . The light the crowd everything . <eos>
 You are a great kid . Do not you forget it . <eos>

 Suzie Toller s missing . <eos>
 Ray thinks she was murdered . <eos>
 You could tell me where you were last night . <eos>
 Back to the land of grownups . <eos>
 The skinny brunette . <eos>
 Lombardo s settlement ? <eos>
 Unless you are setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday . <eos>
 I net a guy in a bar . <eos>
 You could say that . <eos>
 Ray . We do not know anything yet . She could be anywhere . <eos>
 Just check out the car . <eos>

 Where s the body ? <eos>
 We do not know that Ray . <eos>
 Ray you heard him . <eos>

 The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie s . <eos>
 Yeah maybe a little . <eos>
 Why s that ? <eos>
 He dropped Jimmy off first ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 And when he arrived at your house was anyone there ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 So you were alone . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Did he come in with you ? <eos>

 What was that ? <eos>
 He said No little bitch can ever make me come . <eos>
 You know what that will mean for Lombardo . <eos>
 Yeah . okay . he did <eos>
 Shit what difference does it make . Nobody s gonna believe me anyway . <eos>
 Suzie ! Did this man rape you ? <eos>
 I am sorry . you said it hurt ? Why ? <eos>

 Yeah . But I got my bike . <eos>
 You and Suzie used to come out here together ? <eos>
 Oh for Christ s sake . <eos>
