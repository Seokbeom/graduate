 It s possible . <eos>
 I suppose the idea was specialized training . <eos>
 I suppose so . Though of course there s a more sinister explanation . <eos>
 That seems very unlikely . <eos>
 Yes I thought so . <eos>
 Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now . <eos>
 I know . It would be almost inconceivable . <eos>
 But not completely inconceivable ? <eos>
 I suppose it s not logically impossible . <eos>
 I guess it s not . <eos>
 Well that s something . <eos>

 What s this Herr Chamberlain ? <eos>
 Because His Majesty wishes it . <eos>
 Is the Emperor angry with me ? <eos>
 On the contrary . <eos>
 Then why does not he simply appoint me to the post ? <eos>
 Mozart you are not the only composer in Vienna . <eos>
 No but I am the best . <eos>
 A little modesty would suit you better . <eos>
 Who s on this committee ? <eos>
 Kapellmeister Bonno Count Orsini Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri . <eos>
 Naturally the Italians ! Of course ! Always the Italians ! <eos>
 I do not think it was really decided Director . <eos>
 Well done Mozart . Really quite fine . <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 In the sight of God that s a sin . <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 Do you understand that you have sinned ? Gravely . <eos>

 That makes no difference . All men are equal in God s eyes . <eos>
 Are they ? <eos>

 Web s dead . <eos>
 I reckoned . <eos>
 Hell of a war . <eos>
 Looks like Web Mimms was not the only casualty this town s got . <eos>
 Frank do not you have something to say ? <eos>

 I will meet you down there in a few weeks . <eos>
 See you soon . Oh and I appreciate the distraction back there . <eos>
 Y know Uncle Frank . <eos>
 Sounds like he was a hell of a man . <eos>
 That he was . <eos>
 They are making him a hero now . <eos>
 Saved a lot of folk from the railroad . <eos>
 But he killed a lot of men too . <eos>
 Ca not argue that . <eos>
 So what was he ? <eos>
 Uncle Frank ? <eos>

 Teasing you s completely unfair . <eos>
 What you do to me s unfair . The teasing I mean . <eos>
 I should not tease a hero . <eos>
 You did not want to farm ? <eos>
 I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate . <eos>
 A river pirate . <eos>
 Mostly . It would be an all right life for a bachelor . <eos>
 You planning on being a bachelor your whole life Jesse James ? <eos>
 Not if I find the right girl . <eos>
 Where will you find such a girl ? <eos>
 Sparkling rocks ? <eos>
 Little ones . <eos>

 Yep . <eos>
 Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting ? <eos>
 I am so sorry Jesse . <eos>
 Me neither . <eos>

 Laws do not touch men like Thaddeus Rains . Only justice does . <eos>
 Hmm . <eos>

 Last February ? <eos>
 Almost got me in Billings . I saw you there shooting at me . <eos>
 I went myself to oversee the operation . Did not help much . <eos>
 I figured . <eos>
 Was it worth it ? <eos>
 Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it . <eos>
 That s what I would have done . <eos>
 I am not hanged yet . <eos>
 You cocky little bastard . <eos>
 This s unusual . Most of our marriages are members of the congregation . <eos>

 Mr . John Steed please . <eos>
 I am afraid that s impossible . <eos>
 You are female ? <eos>
 As you see . <eos>
 Then you can not come in . <eos>
 I have an appointment . <eos>
 No women . Not in Boodles . Not since 1922 . <eos>
 Sir August . ? Sir August . ? <eos>
 Your voice it s so familiar . <eos>
 This s not a game . <eos>
 Quite right but we still make the rules . <eos>
 Rules are made to be broken . <eos>
 People too . <eos>
 Hmmm . <eos>
 My number two . Special assignments . She s <eos>
 Father will be your controller . Steed here will show you the ropes . <eos>
 Would it be possible to use it for military purposes ? <eos>
 I resign . <eos>
 You need treatment Mrs . Peel . You can not resign . <eos>
 What are you trying to do to me ? <eos>
 The death of Peter Peel was a great loss . To us all . <eos>
 The Institute . the funding . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 About your next assignment Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Ahem . As I was saying perhaps another macaroon . <eos>
 Good luck . Peter . Emma . <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Dr . Darling Peter . all you . <eos>
 An unholy trinity . <eos>
 But I found you . All the clues led me here . <eos>
 Of course . I planned that too . <eos>
 Our revels now are ended . <eos>
 Think of this as your second wedding feast . <eos>
 You know I believe she s actually jealous . <eos>
 What are my choices ? <eos>
 Choices ? <eos>
 Doctor Peel I presume ? <eos>
 I was about to throw in the towel . <eos>
 I had a spot of bother at the door . <eos>
 I should not wonder . Not a woman inside Boodles since <eos>
 1922 . Why the kippers ? <eos>
 Red herring would have been too obvious do not you think ? <eos>
 Under the circumstances you may call me Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 I did not . Mother did . <eos>
 . Showers followed by sunny periods . <eos>
 Ah . From Trubshaw s . My shoemaker . <eos>
 My father always wanted a boy . <eos>
 Really ? I fail to see the connection . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 You can but I wish you would not . <eos>
 That place s so absurd so out of date . <eos>
 Sir August Merryweather . why are we seeing him first ? <eos>
 As per mother s instructions . <eos>
 Do we always follow Mother s instructions ? <eos>
 No thanks . <eos>
 June July . August ? <eos>
 The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined . <eos>
 So . I distract him while you snoop around ? How ? <eos>
 Ah Brenda . Mrs . Peel ? <eos>
 You should be dead . How do you feel ? <eos>
 An invitation . To a formal picnic . <eos>
 I must say you look more your old self <eos>
 You mean my other self . <eos>
 Either way . may I ask why you dress in that fashion ? <eos>
 Colonel Crabtree . International Satellite Systems . Formerly of the Ministry . <eos>
 What on earth ? <eos>
 Any ideas ? <eos>
 Well he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society . <eos>
 Is that written in his shoe ? <eos>
 Common knowledge Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 But <eos>
 Not quite . This s my field . <eos>
 But if someone miniaturized the process . <eos>
 That s what we were working on . <eos>
 Three agents killed by bad weather . <eos>
 Is that what you think ? <eos>
 What Lady Disdain ? Are you yet breathing ? <eos>
 This must be the last straw . <eos>
 Here s the one that broke the camel s back . <eos>
 Someone did not want us to get to the party . <eos>
 Steed . ! <eos>
 Was I ? <eos>
 I expect that s for you to know and me to find out . <eos>
 You followed me . <eos>
 Orders . <eos>
 To kill me ? <eos>
 I could save you the trouble . <eos>
 No trouble . <eos>
 Because you always obey orders . <eos>
 Mmm . what are you doing ? <eos>
 Keeping a stiff upper lip ? <eos>
 But you did suspect me . <eos>
 Not for a moment . <eos>
 You are playing games . <eos>
 Are not we all Mrs . Peel ? <eos>
 I thought you played by the rules . <eos>
 I thought you did not . <eos>
 I am playing to win . <eos>
 Winning s not everything . <eos>
 Please do not tell me it s how you play the game . <eos>
 No after you . <eos>
 You do not trust me ? <eos>
 I told Mother I took care of you . <eos>
 No idea who . No idea why . <eos>
 Teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys All children s things . <eos>
 . Or grown ups who still like to be children . <eos>
 His name s Jones . Invisible Jones . <eos>
 Why s he called Invisible ? <eos>
 Are not you coming ? <eos>
 We must hurry Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Hurry ? What for ? I am just now <eos>
 What s that you are wearing ? <eos>
 It s called Black Leather . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 You first . <eos>
 Trubshaw again ? What now ? <eos>
 They are playing your song Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 I will be back . <eos>
 Mrs . Peel ? <eos>
 What kept you ? <eos>
 The owl and the pussycat went to sea <eos>
 . in a beautiful pea green boat . <eos>
 A fine night Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Have you any place in mind ? <eos>
 I do not recall Siberia being this warm Steed . <eos>
 It s the latest thing Mrs . Peel . <eos>
 Our little paradise just made for two ? <eos>
 Our chaperon . <eos>
 Ah . sun tan lotion . Any shops nearby ? <eos>
 Your mission s simple . Find out how and why these agents died . <eos>
 Peter s brother ? But <eos>
 Who s now vanished . <eos>
 I was getting to it . <eos>
 Getting to what ? <eos>
 The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative <eos>
 Privately owned by . <eos>

 Steed <eos>
 How did you guess ? <eos>
 Mother . I thought you were burglars . <eos>
 Weather s turning nasty . <eos>

 She may not know . Theory goes she may be very ill . <eos>
 Amnesia ? <eos>
 Possibly . Split personality . <eos>
 Insane . ? <eos>
 Who knows ? If Dr . Darling s right you should watch out . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Anyone particular in mind ? <eos>
 Pity . I was growing fond of Mrs . Peel . Unfortunately <eos>
 Guilty until proven innocent ? <eos>

 Good morning . <eos>
 Where are you bound for ? <eos>
 Pooh ! Pooh ! Best you are joking . <eos>
 What s your uncle s name ? <eos>
 O Grady . <eos>
 Ah ! You sly rogue I see that will influence you . <eos>
 The place seems more a farm than an inn yard . <eos>
 Upon my word sir I think you have acted very coolly . <eos>
 I have acted as I think fit . <eos>
 Has he sent the challenge yet ? <eos>
 Have you taken my message to him ? <eos>
 The meeting s arranged . Captain Best s waiting for you now . <eos>
 My mare s saddled and ready who s the captain s second ? <eos>
 I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown . <eos>
 Is Miss Dugan well ? <eos>
 There s only six Miss Dugans now . poor Dorothy . <eos>
 Whom have I been harboring in my house ? Who are you sirrah ? <eos>
 Sirrah ! Sirrah I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland ! <eos>
 You are an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver ! <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Where s my rascal Lazlo ? <eos>
 Good gracious ! What s this ? <eos>
 Ten thousand ? But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand . <eos>
 Your honor must lower his voice . <eos>
 All Europe shall hear of this ! <eos>
 I have no luggage . <eos>
 You are the young man who M . de Seebach recommended ? <eos>
 Your name s Lazlo Zilagyi ? <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach . <eos>
 Herr Seebach was a very kind employer . <eos>
 Who else can give me information about you ? <eos>
 But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost . <eos>
 Have no fear . It will come out well for me . <eos>
 I believe they will deport you . <eos>
 I have faced that problem before . <eos>
 To risk one s life against such people s an imposition . <eos>
 I risk nothing for I am certain to kill him . <eos>
 Certain ? <eos>
 Then you yield to me . <eos>
 On the instant . Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you . <eos>
 Very well but a man who yields takes to his legs . <eos>
 That s a trifle strong . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Have you had one ? <eos>
 Never . <eos>
 But for a time . a passing fancy ? <eos>
 Not one . <eos>
 Have you not a man whom you value ? <eos>
 That man has perhaps not yet been born . <eos>
 How so ? <eos>
 You want my heart ? <eos>
 It s my only object . <eos>
 To make me wretched in two weeks . <eos>
 And if she does not choose to show you some kindness ? <eos>
 Lady Cosgrove you are an old fool . <eos>
 I feel the ribbon . <eos>
 Why are you shaking ? <eos>
 I would draw my sword and cut my way through them . <eos>
 As much as possible . <eos>
 As much as possible ? <eos>
 Yes for I wish to entertain splendidly . <eos>
 All the same you must name an amount . <eos>
 Last month the Duke of Suffolk spent no more . <eos>
 Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus the thirteenth Earl of Crabs ? <eos>

 A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen s impossible . <eos>
 The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country . <eos>
 Then this must be done tomorrow . <eos>
 But I should not like to put you to such trouble Mister . <eos>
 May I be quite frank with you ? <eos>

 This s not our area . Whose area s this <eos>
 We got I do not know we got separated <eos>
 Before or after the explosion ? Mueller <eos>
 Shut the fuck up you fucking faggot You just shut the FUCK UP . <eos>
 West was one thing but this <eos>
 What about you wandering around alone ? At least we have an alibi <eos>
 Holy fuck . Holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do ? <eos>
 Yeah right . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 It s . too slow . <eos>
 Well it s a game of anticipation that s the beauty . <eos>
 I just do not like it . <eos>
 There s no need . <eos>
 Why would you ask for a cop Ray ? <eos>
 Some . <eos>
 And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you ? <eos>
 That son of a bitch . <eos>
 That would be my reaction too <eos>
 I did not shoot West <eos>
 I apologize <eos>
 You saw West s body . <eos>
 And he would been shot . <eos>
 You saved Kendall s life <eos>
 We are not finished yet <eos>
 Not true Cadet I have got a gun <eos>
 He He made me do it <eos>
 Do what ? <eos>
 I promised them I would ask you where West and the others are . <eos>
 Washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead . <eos>
 Tell us about the other guys the ones West weeded out . <eos>
 He was sickly . Had that shaking thing whatd yacall it epoxy ? <eos>
 He said he worked there <eos>
 No did he tell you about it ? About the business Childs ran ? <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Back up . <eos>
 Mueller was alone in the cabin ? <eos>
 Why did not you tell us all this in the first place ? <eos>
 Ohhhh I do not think so . <eos>
 Cadet what s your name ! <eos>
 Sir Dunbar sir ! <eos>
 You know how to work a pistol Dunbar ? <eos>
 Sir yes sir ! <eos>
 What the fuck s going on ? <eos>
 Shut up . Let me see your grenades . <eos>

 Jesus what happened ? <eos>
 Pike and I got separated . then I heard gunfire . Close . <eos>
 So you killed him ? <eos>
 Whose blood s that Jay ? <eos>
 What do you mean West s ? <eos>
 Roberto what the fuck ? <eos>
 We just want to check your pack <eos>
 You know it s not like that <eos>
 Right ? <eos>
 You gotta untie me . I did not do this thing Ray . <eos>
 You hated West more than any of us . <eos>
 Maybe but that do not make me a killer <eos>
 If not you then who ? <eos>
 Mueller . <eos>
 That s exactly what he says about you . <eos>
 You hated West Mueller loved him <eos>
 Enough to go to prison ? Childs PX scam Mueller was in on it <eos>
 Bullshit . <eos>
 Look in my pack . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Combat grade morphine . Mueller sold it to me . <eos>
 You are lying <eos>
 That still does not mean you did not kill him . <eos>
 You saw West right ? How was he killed ? <eos>
 Full clip to the body <eos>
 From up close or far away ? <eos>
 I . I do not know . <eos>
 What do not you know ? <eos>
 A test will no doubt link you to the killing <eos>
 I have done nothing wrong . I am the victim here . <eos>
 What happened to degrees ? <eos>
 I did not kill him <eos>
 But you did not . <eos>
 Somebody emptied a full clip into him <eos>
 I believe your next line s What are you trying to hide ? <eos>
 Jail if he s lucky the gas chamber if he s not <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 How do you know ? <eos>
 I do not know <eos>
 Where are they ! <eos>
 Maybe <eos>
 MAYBE WHAT <eos>
 I am assuming that s what made him the dead one ? <eos>
 Which gives us about five hours . Why would you call me ? <eos>
 The guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop . <eos>
 He s not done by a longshot I can get more out of him <eos>
 Pike killed West Dunbar killed Mueller Childs and Nunez . <eos>
 We have already been over the terrain twice . Nothing . <eos>
 There was a hurricane Bill the wind probably moved it . <eos>
 Nevertheless <eos>
 Nevertheless what ? Kendall will testify and that will be enough . <eos>
 You mean not enough to save you . <eos>
 Tom where are you going <eos>
 Home I am done . <eos>
 What I said before <eos>
 Was dead right . You think Dunbar s on the level ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 That s horseshit and you know it . <eos>
 They are taking your command are not they ? <eos>
 You are a good soldier Bill . <eos>
 You are drunk <eos>
 Stay where you are . <eos>
 Or what ? You have gone round the bend <eos>
 For the last time I have no idea what you are talking about <eos>
 Hostile and uncooperative . <eos>
 Ah Christ <eos>
 You knew Sergeant West ? <eos>
 Gotta be honest I love what you have done with the place <eos>
 Levi ? Who names their kid Levi <eos>
 Senator Jonathan Kendall of Ohio . <eos>
 He s in interrogation ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Move him . <eos>
 Excuse me ? <eos>
 Is Dunbar cute ? <eos>
 Good cop bad cop ? <eos>
 Baseball ? <eos>
 I believe somebody owes me ten dollars <eos>
 You really want to make banal chit chat like that now ? <eos>
 You are right . We should sit in silence . <eos>
 We are in the middle of a murder case <eos>
 You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib . <eos>
 Something like that . You ? <eos>
 I plan to grow on you . <eos>
 You are off to a late start . <eos>
 He s telling the truth up to a point . <eos>
 Something wrong ? <eos>
 Being back here . Gives me the willies . <eos>
 That was kid gloves ? <eos>
 But we have to question him Thought you did not have cigarettes <eos>
 Too neat . How long have you been an investigator ? <eos>
 Why the fuck was not he in restraints ? <eos>
 Goddammit Hardy you can not just leave <eos>
 I did not shoot West . <eos>
 At least you and Kendall agree on that . <eos>
 They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent . <eos>
 Kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin <eos>
 That bugs you too ? <eos>
 Little bit . <eos>
 We are fucked I know <eos>
 They got their stories straight . <eos>
 Are you sure ? <eos>
 Why do not you talk to Levi off the record for a second ? <eos>
 I pushed him too hard . <eos>
 You could not have known <eos>
 Yeah I could have . Should have . <eos>
 You wanted to break him . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 So what now ? <eos>
 Now I go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened . <eos>
 Think it will work ? <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Four <eos>
 We got maybe three minutes till they break it down . <eos>
 Hardy what are you doing <eos>
 We can tie you to the chair if it will work better for you <eos>
 Hardy for Chrissakes <eos>
 No bodies no West . <eos>
 We need to talk <eos>
 What if I do not want it ? <eos>
 That s not true . <eos>
 There are degrees of truth officer . Always degrees . <eos>
 You are a good man Hardy . <eos>
 West ? <eos>
 What are you doing out here ? <eos>
 Leaving without saying goodbye . What are you gonna do ? <eos>
 Go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened . <eos>
 Think it will work ? <eos>
 Nah . <eos>
 I should probably write that down . <eos>
 He was your friend . <eos>
 Pike please <eos>
 Maybe we should not go . <eos>
 The faggot speaks . <eos>
 You ever been in a hurricane Mueller ? <eos>
 They found him . Poor fucker was practically blown in half <eos>
 Pike and I got separated <eos>

 I remember now it was before the explosion <eos>
 Oh you remember now <eos>
 I was freezing from the hurricane <eos>
 He said what ? <eos>
 You are gonna die tonight faggot . Clear as day . <eos>
 No one else heard it ? <eos>
 Nunez was chasing Dunbar . <eos>
 Because he would shot Mueller . <eos>
 Pike never confessed . <eos>
 Enjoy your flight to Washington <eos>

 Nerves of steel . <eos>

 During the road test . <eos>

 What the fuck for ? <eos>
 It s a good job . <eos>
 The best . <eos>
 Does it eat ? <eos>
 Jeezus ! <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 Me . <eos>
 It s artificial ? <eos>
 Are you apprehensive ? <eos>
 I would never get an abortion . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 That would be murder Mr . Deckard . <eos>
 In your opinion . <eos>
 It would be my child . <eos>
 I have already got more help than I need . <eos>
 Two of us might be more effective than one . <eos>
 You use your equipment do not you ? <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 Do I make you nervous ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 I can imagine . <eos>
 They probably want to find out when they were made . <eos>
 Do not just stand there looking at me . It s not polite . <eos>
 What do you want me to do ? <eos>
 You ever take a bath with a man before ? <eos>
 I told you I would come back . <eos>
 You did ? <eos>
 Who s this ? <eos>

 What ? <eos>
 I do not know . I think I missed something . <eos>
 Like ? <eos>
 When was the last time you cleaned this place ? <eos>
 Hmmm ? <eos>
 Have you ever cleaned your apartment ? <eos>
 Do not be fooled by appearances . <eos>
 They could clean around the arrangement . <eos>
 But if I do not plug it in how can I . <eos>
 Never mind the plug just go through the motions . <eos>
 But then how can you . <eos>
 This feels stupid . <eos>
 You are sick Deckard . <eos>
 Have you ever known anybody a long time ? <eos>
 You mean a woman ? <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 What s a long time ? <eos>
 Ten years . <eos>
 Why do you call it retire why do not you call it murder ? <eos>
 Because it s not . <eos>
 Do not you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered ? <eos>
 Andies only simulate suffering if they are programmed for it . <eos>
 Do you think I simulated what happened between us ? <eos>
 What difference will it make ? <eos>
 You know what I think ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Where the hell you been ? <eos>
 What s up ? <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 Black ? <eos>
 Is this to be an empathy test ? <eos>
 May I ask a personal question ? <eos>
 Go ahead . <eos>
 Have you ever retired a human by mistake ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 But in your profession that s a risk . <eos>
 One that relies on human interpretation . Where s the subject ? <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 If she s the machine works . <eos>
 How many questions did it take ? <eos>
 How many questions does it usually take Mr . Deckard ? <eos>
 Let s keep our eyes on the road Deckard . <eos>

 This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca . <eos>
 That s also true except for one destination to return to occupied France . <eos>
 Occupied France ? <eos>
 There are only two other alternatives for him . <eos>
 Not an easy day to forget . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Say goodnight to Sam for me . <eos>
 We said no questions . <eos>

 I do not know what you mean Miss Ilsa . <eos>
 You are very kind . <eos>
 This time they really mean to stop me . <eos>
 Victor I am afraid for you . <eos>
 I must find out what Berger knows . <eos>
 Be careful . <eos>
 Goodnight . <eos>

 He suggested I ask you . <eos>

 And about Victor Laszlo everywhere . <eos>
 And I congratulate you . <eos>
 What for ? <eos>

 Good evening . <eos>
 Monsieur Blaine I wonder if I could talk to you ? <eos>

 There is . I suggest that you ask your wife . <eos>

 I said ask your wife . <eos>
 Well this might come in handy . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Had a close one eh ? <eos>

 Rick this s Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich . <eos>
 You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others . <eos>
 Ho diplomatist ! <eos>
 You see Major you have nothing to worry about Rick . <eos>
 Mademoiselle . <eos>
 But everybody s having such a good time . <eos>
 Yes much too good a time . The place s to be closed . <eos>
 But I have no excuse to close it . <eos>
 What s the meaning of that phone call ? <eos>
 Why do you stand here ? Why do not you stop him ? <eos>
 The plane to Lisbon . You would like to be on it ? <eos>
 Why ? What s in Lisbon ? <eos>
 It was a combination of all three . <eos>
 And what in heaven s name brought you to Casablanca ? <eos>
 My health . I came to Casablanca for the waters . <eos>
 Waters ? What waters ? We are in the desert . <eos>
 I was misinformed . <eos>
 What again ? <eos>
 I stick my neck out for nobody . <eos>
 Yeah ? What s his name ? <eos>
 Victor Laszlo . <eos>
 Rick that s the first time I have ever seen you so impressed . <eos>
 It will be interesting to see how he manages . <eos>
 Manages what ? <eos>
 His escape . <eos>
 This s the end of the chase . <eos>
 Is that a serious offer ? <eos>
 I just paid out twenty . I would like to get it back . <eos>
 Make it ten . I am only a poor corrupt official . <eos>
 Why two ? <eos>
 He s traveling with a lady . <eos>
 Maybe he s not quite as romantic as you are . <eos>
 And got well paid for it on both occasions . <eos>
 The winning side would have paid you much better . <eos>
 Maybe . Well it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here . <eos>
 I have my orders . <eos>
 Yeah you were saying ? <eos>
 Oh how do you do ? <eos>
 That makes Rick a citizen of the world . <eos>
 Oh no Rick never <eos>
 Louis are you pro Vichy or Free French ? <eos>
 Serves me right for asking a direct question . The subject s closed . <eos>
 Well it looks like you are a little late . <eos>
 As I suspected you are a rank sentimentalist . <eos>
 Yeah ? Why ? <eos>
 Why do you interfere with my little romances ? <eos>
 How can you close me up ? On what grounds ? <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 And I am taking a friend with me . One you will appreciate . <eos>
 Oh thanks . <eos>
 I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs . <eos>
 I have the letters right here . <eos>
 Tell me when we searched the place where were they ? <eos>
 Sam s piano . <eos>
 Have you taken leave of your senses ? <eos>
 I have . Sit down over there . <eos>
 I do . We have got plenty of time to discuss that later . <eos>
 You think of everything do not you ? <eos>
 Maybe but it seemed like a good time to start . <eos>
 And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses . <eos>
 Our expenses ? <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 Where were you last night ? <eos>
 That s so long ago I do not remember . <eos>
 Will I see you tonight ? <eos>
 Give me another . <eos>
 Sacha she s had enough . <eos>
 Rick I am sick and tired of having you <eos>
 Come on we are going to get your coat . <eos>
 Make it official if you like . <eos>
 What s your nationality ? <eos>
 I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation . <eos>
 Aha . Who do you think will win the war ? <eos>
 In this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh ? <eos>
 Hello ? <eos>
 Put that phone down ! <eos>
 Get me the Radio Tower ! <eos>
 Uh excuse me please . Hello Rick . <eos>
 Well what makes you think I have not ? <eos>
 Oh nothing . But when you first came to Casablanca I thought <eos>
 Thank you . Will you have a drink with me please ? <eos>
 Who did you bribe for your visa ? Renault or yourself ? <eos>
 For how long ? <eos>
 Perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer . <eos>

 Am I s posed to be grateful ? <eos>
 Whoa there Tex ! We have been through all this . <eos>
 It s alright Peter we are fine . <eos>
 Look if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out <eos>
 I have not been able to get you off my mind . <eos>

 What s in it for you ? <eos>
 Your help . <eos>
 I did not make it this far by attracting a lot of attention . <eos>
 See you are back and still rocking the boat . <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 I do not know what to say . <eos>
 You are involved . By being alive you are involved . <eos>
 And you still think you can do something to change that . <eos>
 I am looking for a lady who works here . <eos>

 You do not want to . <eos>
 I need to talk to her . <eos>
 Max something . I got no clue where she stays . <eos>
 Any idea when she will be back ? <eos>
 None . <eos>
 Who s it ? <eos>
 A friend of your fiance s . <eos>
 Look I do not know what you want <eos>
 Big part of loving someone s being able to forgive them . <eos>
 You are also a fool . <eos>
 This s not a place you wanna go . <eos>
 Say the words I understand . <eos>
 I understand . <eos>
 I asked you to keep that thing outside . <eos>

 One seven four nine five Natoma . <eos>
 Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him . <eos>

 You are way more philosophical than I could ever be . <eos>
 That s odd . <eos>
 Tell me the truth . Am I a female fog bank ? <eos>
 You are not seriously buying into Darren s nonsense . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 He was just trying to blame you cause he s a slut . <eos>
 A little what ? <eos>
 You know what I am saying . <eos>
 If I knew what you were saying I would not be asking . <eos>
 How long you and me known each other ? <eos>

 Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right ? <eos>
 Gotta go . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 You are actually gonna bail Sketchy out . <eos>
 Yeah cause maybe he s learned his lesson . <eos>
 Unlikely . <eos>
 And because he s my friend . <eos>
 Friends do not help other friends cheat . <eos>
 And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 They are prisoners to their genes . <eos>
 So are dogs . <eos>
 They do not have a lot of moving parts . <eos>
 Only one I can think of . <eos>
 Yeah I can see to it your winning streak continues . <eos>
 Not right now . <eos>

 Quitting time . Grab a cold one ? <eos>
 I gotta meet Natalie for dinner . <eos>
 Right the big one oh . <eos>
 Hey Sketchy <eos>
 We gotta talk . <eos>
 Do guys actually believe their lame self serving excuses ? <eos>
 Lame self serving arrogant . guilty as charged . <eos>
 You left out condescending . <eos>
 But there s another side <eos>
 Here it comes . The part where the guy turns everything around . <eos>
 I am the victim here . <eos>
 And you were a sympathetic ear . <eos>
 Exactly . <eos>
 Does this person have a name ? <eos>
 Lydia . <eos>
 And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way ? <eos>
 I am a toy to her . <eos>
 She tells you how I have been <eos>
 How would you get her out of town ? <eos>
 Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo . <eos>
 I will give it my best shot . <eos>
 Max what did I do to deserve a friend like you ? <eos>
 You rock Max . You . Rock . <eos>
 Lydia may not have been one of humanity s finer specimens but <eos>

 You can not . Death s God s will ! <eos>

 Will you please get back in your wagon ? And stay there ? <eos>
 More wine sister ? Surely you can drink more than that . <eos>
 Did Narcissus die today ? Was not this his day to die ? <eos>
 How about in the forum . Right in front of the Senate . <eos>

 For the gods spit it out ! <eos>
 Tribuus . tomorrow . <eos>
 Where have you been ? <eos>
 Taking my pleasure . Do I need to clear my lovers with you ? <eos>
 What are you talking about ? <eos>
 Now that we are done with that infatuation forever . <eos>
 If I ever loved Narcissus it was not like you want . <eos>
 Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger . <eos>
 You can not do that . listen to the mood of the crowd . <eos>
 I am their hero ! <eos>
 Not yet dear brother . <eos>
 Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience ? <eos>
 That s difficult to say general . <eos>
 Then you would be out of a job . <eos>
 Caesar ? <eos>
 They wo not break this one . <eos>
 Caesar ignore them . <eos>
 Yes . You know that s not a bad idea . <eos>
 Maybe it will crush Gaius . <eos>
 I am serious . <eos>
 Caesar let me sponsor your first wager in the arena . <eos>
 Marcus Aurelius has died . <eos>
 Where s my father ? <eos>
 Yes Caesar ? <eos>
 I have read of it . <eos>
 The trouble s defining exactly what right is . <eos>
 You are hearing about somebody else . <eos>
 How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial ? <eos>
 I need to give you my word when yours s worth nothing ? <eos>
 You are a citizen and a soldier . Not a gladiator . <eos>
 Why you ? <eos>
 Is this Rome ? Are we just going to be executed ? <eos>
 You know our two most senior Senators Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus ? <eos>
 I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities . <eos>
 It s my brother s neck you want not mine . <eos>
 You mean a symbol of someone who does not exist . <eos>
 You cannot die . <eos>
 Would that Marcus had lived . <eos>
 Marcus would have lived but . was poisoned by his son . <eos>
 He killed his father and then my family . <eos>
 Servis made it through again ? <eos>
 The Senators admire you . <eos>
 Tomorrow ? <eos>
 As soon as I can . <eos>
 On your honor as a Roman officer daddy ? <eos>
 Why do not we try to keep politics out of the conversation . <eos>
 Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal . <eos>
 My troops do not make policy . <eos>
 You brought the army into Rome . <eos>
 I was summoned . <eos>
 He s very realistic . <eos>
 Well you wanted the girls to have the best teachers . <eos>
 Greeks ? <eos>
 What about their philosophy lessons ? <eos>
 They are studying with Cynics . <eos>
 You need to come home ! <eos>
 I can see that . <eos>
 Let him trust Quintus . <eos>
 Quintus s overly idealistic . <eos>
 I do not even want to imagine the things you have seen . <eos>
 Take your hands off me animal ! <eos>
 I refuse to be your slave . I refuse <eos>
 General do you realize what happened out there today ? <eos>
 I did not get killed and everyone else did . <eos>
 Proximo if this s her doctor he s an assassin . <eos>
 You get to come alive again in the country ! <eos>
 How much money s involved ? <eos>
 Fantastic ! Wonderful ! But posters are very expensive . <eos>
 Before they leave get gold . <eos>
 You were a soldier and then a gladiator were not you ? <eos>
 I want nothing to do with the arena . <eos>
 Hello . <eos>
 You are living at home now . Is that right ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Do you know what you are going to do ? <eos>

 Well look . I have no intention of taking her out . <eos>

 Sickness comes to us all Mister Dillon . <eos>
 Why am I here ? <eos>

 Impressive Blake . Where would you learn how to do that ? <eos>

 Carter . <eos>
 A dead body ? <eos>

 Taupin s not that the guy Moran picked up the other night ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 I warned you . <eos>
 Does not have a head does he ? <eos>
 How s your uncle ? I hardly ever see him anymore . <eos>
 Did not think it was my buddy over there . <eos>
 Figured you knew more about swords than I did . <eos>
 Claymore . <eos>
 You are the expert . <eos>
 You are very macabre . <eos>
 It s my birthday . <eos>
 Happy birthday . <eos>
 Would you like more tea ? <eos>
 He was unsual . <eos>
 Then you did not know Richard later on . <eos>
 Do not know about any of that . Suppose nobody does . <eos>
 Would you remember his name ? <eos>
 This s against the rules . <eos>
 So s playing choo choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of <eos>
 Okay okay . <eos>
 Church Hill that s pretty close s not it ? <eos>
 Do you play ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Miss Cartwright what s it I can do for you ? <eos>
 I would like to ask you about the claymore . <eos>
 Byzantine ? <eos>
 Good reflexes . <eos>
 Someone beat you . <eos>
 Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries Miss Cartwright ? <eos>
 Grave robbers ? <eos>
 Probably . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 People like that rarely leave business cards . <eos>
 You have an active imagination . <eos>
 I have friends . <eos>
 Jesus Christ . <eos>
 You will be safe here . He wo not kill in a church . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Tradition . <eos>
 He tried to kill me last night . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Who s he ? <eos>
 At the moment ? Carl Smith . <eos>
 He called you MacLeod . <eos>
 That bothers you ? <eos>
 What about me ? <eos>
 Have you gone to the police ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why not ? I am sure they would love to hear your story . <eos>
 I would rather hear yours . <eos>
 He sees me as a threat . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 No one knows you are here ? <eos>
 No . I had to talk to you . <eos>
 You had to do nothing ! <eos>
 You are wrong . <eos>
 You are a fool . <eos>
 Is this what you killed them with ? <eos>
 You did kill those men . <eos>
 Not all of them . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 No . So what now ? We just wait ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 It s some sort of party the town s throwing . <eos>
 They do it each year . <eos>
 Maybe it would do us both good . <eos>
 It s beautiful . <eos>
 William Taupin seems to have left his mark . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And you are William Taupin are not you ? <eos>
 Then you must be at least 70 years old . <eos>
 At least . <eos>
 It s frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people s lives . <eos>
 A factor of age . <eos>
 I hope I never get that old . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 I am not even sure why . <eos>
 You are a very perceptive young woman . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 That would be difficult to explain . <eos>
 That s why Smith called you MacLeod . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He knows about you . <eos>
 He s older than I . <eos>
 That s insane . <eos>
 Perhaps . There s something more . An inheritance . <eos>
 Of bodies . <eos>
 I did not kill the watchman . <eos>
 You killed those other two . <eos>
 Not the same . <eos>
 What about that family in 31 ? <eos>
 There are differences . <eos>
 You kill with your left hand ? <eos>
 I have not killed you . <eos>
 Do not . <eos>
 Come here Brenna . <eos>
 But you are known so much . History I will only read about . <eos>
 It s all the same . Half lives that never go away . <eos>
 What s it you want ? <eos>
 Will I see you again ? <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Get out . <eos>
 The inheritance . <eos>
 Life . It s the gift and the under standing of life . <eos>
 Forget it . <eos>
 I am just curious . <eos>
 Now there s a new topic . <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 I am calling an attorney . <eos>
 You and I should talk first . <eos>
 Four ? <eos>
 All fashionably without heads . <eos>
 You are an asshole Moran . <eos>
 I want Taupin . <eos>
 What s all of this got to do with me ? <eos>
 What were you doing in Felton ? <eos>
 Research . If your pal was there I never saw him . <eos>
 I have witnesses that can put the two of you together . <eos>
 Corey you owe me . <eos>
 It s that important ? <eos>
 Who s it ? <eos>
 I do not believe him . <eos>
 Requiem acer nam donaei <eos>
 What are you doing man ? <eos>
 Et lux perpetua <eos>
 You will not be bringing the church into this . <eos>

 Three days you have laid there . It s time you ate . <eos>
 This can not be . <eos>
 You are not dead boy . Accept it . <eos>
 This s monstrous . I will burn in hell for all eternity . <eos>
 You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Harder . Concentrate harder . <eos>
 Me arm hurts . <eos>
 Harder ! You swing like an impotent cow ! <eos>
 Go to hell . <eos>
 Impotent cow . <eos>
 It will take less effort as you learn . <eos>
 You have a gift . One you must protect . <eos>
 What s the fascinatioon ? It s only a leaf . <eos>
 Go ahead Senor . I have my friend to keep me company . <eos>
 I am your future husband remember ? <eos>
 My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands . <eos>
 Some think not . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 There s rumor in the village . Some call it magic . <eos>
 You are sounding like that mad woman Widow Baggins . <eos>
 Leave me alone Conor . Please . <eos>
 Oh please . Another one . <eos>
 What would you like ? <eos>
 Something pretty . <eos>
 That s wonderful . Where did you ever learn it ? <eos>
 Far away . <eos>
 David . <eos>
 Who am I deceiving ? <eos>
 State of grace and all that . <eos>
 Tradition . <eos>
 Romirez understood . Not you . <eos>

 Complete your inspection ? <eos>
 We need more time . <eos>
 Eat up Dupont . It will probably be your last . <eos>
 Your name ? <eos>
 I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill . <eos>
 Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break fast cooking . <eos>
 What s your position ? <eos>
 Second musketeer . <eos>
 I understand you joined up in Bremen . <eos>
 Excuse me sir . I thought we spoke as equals . <eos>
 Equals ? <eos>
 Wait . I think we understand each other . <eos>
 It can be different . It must be . <eos>
 We must talk . <eos>
 Stay out of it . <eos>
 Do not turn your back on me . <eos>
 You are really going to force this are not you ? <eos>
 You see Major ? You are not so different . <eos>
 Ah Conor how you look a man . <eos>
 Must he go ? <eos>
 Aye . It s his duty . All of ours . <eos>
 But Ian he s still but a boy . <eos>
 Where did you learn that ? <eos>
 My father taught me . <eos>
 Your father must be smart . <eos>
 I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff . <eos>
 Figure she s with him ? <eos>
 Round up who you can and put them on standby . <eos>
 Think we should call the local P . D . out there first ? <eos>
 Where ! <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Smith . Carl Smith . <eos>
 How many came ? <eos>
 The last four . <eos>
 And the Bulgarian ? <eos>
 He got him . He always does . Eventually . <eos>
 He knows I am here . How ? <eos>
 Spare a chair ? <eos>
 How are you ? <eos>
 Head still secure to the neck . <eos>
 How did you find me ? <eos>
 What are you doing here ? <eos>
 And have you something to settle with me ? <eos>
 Not tonight . Tonight I have a drink with an old friend . <eos>
 He found us even there . <eos>
 I have not drunk this much since <eos>
 I love zoos . Ever since I was a kid . <eos>
 I knew his great grandfather . <eos>
 You are insane . <eos>
 The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth . <eos>
 Long time . <eos>
 You have been here from the start . <eos>
 Friend of yours ? <eos>
 Of sorts . <eos>
 Run ! <eos>
 Leave her out of this . <eos>
 What s the point ? <eos>
 This s not done . Get up . <eos>
 Tradition . <eos>
 It s all we have . <eos>
 Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play . <eos>
 Leave her alone . <eos>
 We have some unfinished business . <eos>
 Are you here ? <eos>
 I want you to come to me . <eos>
 And if I refuse ? <eos>
 Yes laddie I have her . <eos>
 This your present address ? <eos>

 Do you know what this is ? <eos>
 A mystery . <eos>
 My condolences . <eos>
 Where were you Tuesday night ? <eos>
 Home . <eos>
 A neighbor saw your car leave . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 You are a kind man to be sure . <eos>
 I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family . <eos>
 Steven Conor did not die . <eos>
 The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs ? <eos>
 You are one of William s kids huh ? <eos>

 He was Rex Rexroth s personal attorney . <eos>
 Marylin ! What have I done ? <eos>
 Except for two years when he was in the Navy in Korea . <eos>
 Prior to your marriage what was your profession ? <eos>
 I was a hostess . For Trans World Airlines . <eos>
 What s your husband s profession ? <eos>

 Comfy ! <eos>

 Please ! Leave the house . <eos>
 I fell in love Miles . <eos>
 So did I . Now pack up a few basics and <eos>
 It s a no go Joe . <eos>
 Marylin ! <eos>
 Wait ! He works for YOU ? <eos>
 Now . But first he worked for you . <eos>
 Marylin . Run . I will distract him . <eos>
 Hello Marylin . <eos>
 Hello Miles . <eos>
 Hard to believe this s the way it will end up for us . <eos>
 You wounded me first Marylin . <eos>
 Your forgetting Rex Rexroth ? <eos>
 You are forgetting Howard Doyle ? <eos>
 Forgery ? Fraud ? <eos>
 Income tax evasion ? <eos>
 Murder ? <eos>
 Murder ! <eos>
 Sweet . <eos>
 Rex . Get away from the door . <eos>
 Look Marylin can not we have a civilized discussion about this ? <eos>
 Are you forgetting about the Atcheson Topeka and the Santa Fe ? <eos>
 Hello Rex . <eos>
 Marylin . <eos>
 Are you alright ? You lost weight . <eos>
 Do you need a Tagamet ? <eos>
 Have you been taking your digestive enzymes ? <eos>
 I was devastated . Of course . <eos>
 Who s that ? <eos>
 Is this a lover ? <eos>
 Forgery and Fraud ? <eos>
 You used his credit card . <eos>
 He never even asked . He just assumed <eos>
 He was right was not he ? <eos>
 You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow ? <eos>
 She did a Harriman . <eos>
 Miles Massey . <eos>
 Of Massey Myerson ? <eos>
 Who s she ? <eos>
 Maybe . <eos>
 Lilly s up . <eos>
 Every week <eos>
 So where are you now ? <eos>

 Shit . <eos>
 Sarah Sorkin . Ramona Barcelona this s Miles Massey . <eos>
 But Marylin without this you are completely exposed . <eos>
 Is this Ming ? <eos>
 I can not do this anymore . Let s get some lunch . <eos>
 What about rugs ? I thought we were stopping at Mansour ? <eos>
 So what ? <eos>
 Miles s different . He s still so idealistic . <eos>
 Soon you will have your own rage ! <eos>
 Wait . I know you . <eos>
 Excuse me ? <eos>
 Herb wants to see me ? <eos>
 Mr . Massey <eos>
 Marylin Rexroth ? When does she <eos>
 So Miles . If you have a proposal let s hear it . <eos>
 At this point my client s still prepared to consider reconciliation . <eos>
 That s delusional . <eos>
 My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period . <eos>
 Ha Ha . <eos>
 So much for the icebreakers . What are you after Ruth ? <eos>
 My client s prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets . <eos>
 Why only fifty percent Ruth ? Why not ask for a hundred percent ? <eos>
 Oh brother . Here we go . <eos>
 Are you familiar with Kirshner ? <eos>
 . arty farty ! <eos>
 . The fault dear Brutus s not in our stars . <eos>
 Do not give me that crap . That s MY crap . <eos>
 And it s good ! <eos>
 I will have you suspended . I will have you disbarred . <eos>
 Do not threaten me Miles . I did nothing illegal . <eos>
 Where does that leave us ? <eos>
 Mr . Rexroth . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 . Well my wife has me between a rock and a hard place . <eos>
 Mm . <eos>
 Ah . <eos>
 You know what I mean when I say it . <eos>
 Gotcha . No need to get anatomically correct with me Rex . <eos>
 I do not know . I can assume . <eos>
 Not in court you can not . Has she retained counsel ? <eos>
 I am not sure . <eos>
 And your wife s aware of or has evidence of your activities ? <eos>
 That s the problem . I can not afford to give her anything . <eos>
 I think that went as well as could be expected . <eos>
 She always looked out for me . <eos>
 And she had private investigators assisting her . <eos>
 She brought my digestive enzymes . <eos>
 In anticipation of making you sick . <eos>
 Wait . He wants to give her . <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 And she has . <eos>
 Video . <eos>
 Wrigley ! <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>

 Ah but s she richer than Mrs . Croesus ? <eos>

 She owes me a meal . <eos>
 I would stay away from her Miles . <eos>
 Wrigley ? <eos>
 The plastic surgeon ! I read about you in LA Style . <eos>
 I tried to reach Ruth but we could not get her . <eos>
 We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well <eos>
 Let me tell you something about Patty . <eos>

 You are wasting your time . I am already married to him . <eos>
 Where are you taking me ? <eos>

 What have you got against King Westley ? <eos>
 Nothing much . I just think he s a fake that s all . <eos>
 You only met him once . <eos>

 Why ? Do you know him ? <eos>
 Oh no no . <eos>
 You have not heard from him have you Dad ? <eos>
 Why no . . . Do not be silly . <eos>

 Casual . <eos>
 Casual ? You were boning her were not you ? <eos>
 It was not serious . What s your problem ? <eos>
 You are ! I do not like you . <eos>
 That s crazy ! Why would I draw attention to myself like that ? <eos>
 Meaning it looks like his victims are chosen at random . <eos>
 What do you mean no ? <eos>
 He says it s a game . All games have a strategy . <eos>
 Morpheus . <eos>
 Are you crazy ? <eos>
 We did not ask for your opinion Doctor . <eos>
 I would not know . <eos>
 That s right . I guess only the killer would know that . <eos>
 How would you get in here ? <eos>
 The door was open . <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 You got it on the board . <eos>
 No I need the original note . <eos>
 He s not talking about himself . <eos>
 Then let s narrow it down . <eos>
 You sure you were not over on Pine Road ? <eos>
 I am positive . <eos>
 Yes you are . <eos>
 You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy you crazy fuck ! <eos>
 The message ! I figured out <eos>
 You want me to what ? <eos>
 I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer . <eos>
 Local ? <eos>
 We would not want someone s death to interfere with your games . <eos>
 Take it easy . Both of you . <eos>
 No shit ! <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 How s she ? <eos>
 She s unconscious but they think she s going to make it . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 A few people . <eos>
 Did anyone stand out ? <eos>
 What do you mean stand out ? <eos>
 Did anyone look suspicious ? Think ! <eos>
 Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious . <eos>
 It does not make sense because we do not understand it . <eos>
 Do not fuck with us ! Where did you go ! <eos>
 We will find the evidence . <eos>
 Hello Peter . <eos>
 Hello Peter . <eos>
 Yes . Why did you kill Debi Rutlege ? <eos>
 To get your attention . <eos>
 Did you know her ? <eos>
 Where s she ? <eos>
 You know her ? <eos>
 Not really . <eos>
 Why her ? <eos>
 Because she s the type . <eos>
 But you said you did not know her . <eos>
 I know what I said ! She looks just like . <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 Huxley s quote also says his play s always fair and just . <eos>
 Have you any idea what the message is ? <eos>
 What makes you think I was there ? <eos>
 I could not tell you that . It would ruin the game . <eos>
 You are playing the Tarakoss opening . <eos>
 Very good . <eos>
 What word did you leave last night ? <eos>
 The police have not told you ? <eos>
 Hello Peter . <eos>
 You sonofabitch ! <eos>

 Please . wait . <eos>
 The game s over . You lost . <eos>
 I know where you are . <eos>
 Very good . How did you know ? <eos>

 Would you mind keeping your voice down ? I have guests . <eos>
 It worked out alright did not it ? <eos>
 Feeling better ? <eos>

 I am just nervous . Sorry . <eos>
 You are safe . He would not come here . <eos>
 Why did he ? <eos>

 Come here . <eos>
 You must be Erica . <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 So are you having a good time on the Island ? <eos>
 Do you like my dad ? <eos>
 I know he really likes you . <eos>
 How do you know that ? Did he say something ? <eos>
 Okay . Nice meeting you . <eos>
 Congratulations dad . <eos>

 That has nothing to do with it . <eos>
 You want to sleep in my bed tonight ? <eos>
 Has he gotten through to any ? <eos>
 What s it dad ? <eos>
 Do not you have something you want to say to David ? <eos>
 You ready ? <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 You told me you would take me over to Seattle today . <eos>
 I am sorry honey I can not . Not today . <eos>
 It s not Kathy . <eos>
 How long has she been dead ? <eos>
 Six eight hours tops . <eos>
 There s no blood . Where s the fuckin blood ? <eos>
 What about prints ? <eos>
 No prints . <eos>
 You mean no prints but hers ? <eos>
 Same as the others ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 How long she been dead ? <eos>
 I would say at least eighteen hours . <eos>
 We are not sure . <eos>
 What do you think he did ? <eos>
 I am busy right now . <eos>
 I see you are still having problems with your openings . <eos>
 Anything else ? <eos>
 His home would be . Mount Olympus . <eos>
 I know that . I have seen the photo s . <eos>
 Each of those grids represents almost a square mile . <eos>
 What time did he get there ? <eos>
 We can not rely on your judgement anymore . <eos>
 The most logical choice . <eos>
 Ten days ago . <eos>
 Do you know how she found the apartment ? <eos>
 Could you tell me where you were last night ? <eos>
 You want me to go with you ? Maybe I can help . <eos>
 Another one ? What word did he leave ? <eos>
 It s a commercial area . No one lives there . <eos>
 Where were you last night ? <eos>
 Are we going to go through this again ? <eos>
 Answer the question . <eos>
 Jeremy would have never killed himself . <eos>
 Alright c mon Peter . We are moving you to a cell . <eos>
 He knows you are aware of that . <eos>
 Then I will transpose . <eos>
 On a variation yes but it must be a variation that s unique . <eos>
 It s a good play but risky . <eos>
 You are always in the middle of a match . <eos>
 You have something you want to say ? <eos>
 Just thought you might want to talk . <eos>
 About what ? <eos>
 Whatever s on your mind . <eos>
 What do you see here ? <eos>
 Mate in five . <eos>
 She went into town with Mrs . Lutz . Did they get him ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Feel like practicing ? <eos>
 I can check and call you back . <eos>
 Thank you . I am at 639 7393 . <eos>
 Bainbridge Books . <eos>
 What are they please ? <eos>
 Sorry . I thought it was empty . <eos>
 Is this your first time here ? <eos>
 Are you with the tournament ? <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 Are you one of the players ? <eos>
 When I was very young . <eos>
 Are you disappointed that I wo not answer you ? <eos>
 I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation . <eos>
 I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess . <eos>
 It is . <eos>
 Do you always open quickly ? <eos>
 Are we talking about me or chess ? <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Each circumstance requires a different tactic . <eos>
 Well I think I have had enough . <eos>
 What are you looking for ? <eos>
 Nothing . I just came in for a steam . <eos>
 We need your help . <eos>
 I can not right now . I have got a game . <eos>
 She could be dead after the game . <eos>
 You sure you do not want to eat something ? <eos>
 You sound like my mother . <eos>
 I think it s interesting . <eos>
 Another kind of game ? <eos>
 In a way . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 Let s change the subject . <eos>
 You mean like in the steam room ? <eos>
 That s not fair ! <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Relax . <eos>
 How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw . <eos>
 I know it was bad . <eos>
 I know you did not <eos>
 You know Andy thinks you are doing this . <eos>
 Does not that scare you ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it ? <eos>
 No . But I am open to distractions . <eos>
 You always want to talk about me . What about you ? <eos>
 Was not I just talking about me ? <eos>
 No . You were talking about chess . <eos>
 Alright . What about me ? <eos>
 I dunno . Where s Erica mother ? <eos>
 She died in a car accident . <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>
 It s alright . It was a long time ago . <eos>
 It must have been very hard on Erica ? <eos>
 It was . <eos>
 I am not playing a game now . <eos>
 Yes you are . You are playing word games . <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 I am just trying to get to know you Peter . <eos>
 What are you talking about ? You do not even know me . <eos>
 I just do not want to fight with you . <eos>
 You have got to face the things you feel . <eos>
 I thought you were the woman who did not want to get involved . <eos>
 I am hungry . <eos>
 Fine . <eos>
 What do you want on it ? <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Would you settle for pepperoni ? <eos>
 Did you call ? <eos>
 I thought you said the line was busy ? <eos>
 I tried again and got through . <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 Peter . <eos>
 For emphasis ? <eos>
 Exactly . It s the key . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Hi . <eos>
 I am not looking for an apology Peter . <eos>
 You are wife died . You can not feel responsible for that . <eos>
 You do not understand . <eos>
 Then help me to understand . I want to understand . <eos>
 But I do . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 This letter . I have never opened it . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Because I know what it says . <eos>
 It could be anything . <eos>
 How did you know it was carefully ? <eos>
 Frank told me . <eos>
 You are right . The killer told me . <eos>
 This s not going to be like the phone book s it ? <eos>
 You are going to be late for your match . <eos>
 Are you going to come tonight ? <eos>
 You beat him . <eos>
 You are getting sloppy Yurilivich . You are nervous ? <eos>
 I am not nervous . <eos>
 I am sorry . I could not help it . <eos>
 Mine was worse I dreamt you picked your nose in public . <eos>
 That s worse . <eos>
 You are really not bad looking . Almost handsome . <eos>
 Take off your clothes . I am going to scrub you down . <eos>
 u What u ? <eos>
 We are almost married . <eos>
 I do not trust you to wash behind your ears . <eos>
 Thank you but I can wait . <eos>
 I lied . <eos>
 About what ? <eos>
 Lyssa . Lyssa . <eos>
 Have they harmed you ? <eos>
 Lyssa . Where are they keeping you ? <eos>
 Lyssa . <eos>
 Colwyn . <eos>
 I will find you . I will be with you . <eos>
 I know it . <eos>
 I love you Lyssa I love you . <eos>
 Colwyn . <eos>
 You must move away from the Center . <eos>
 Will your power outward . <eos>
 I do not know how . <eos>
 Take the western passage . <eos>
 Lyssa . <eos>
 In the Arctic ice . <eos>
 That s a better one . <eos>
 It was a platonic kiss Father . <eos>
 They have Lyssa ! <eos>
 You will go alone . <eos>
 The White Castle has fallen . <eos>
 Does the Queen live ? <eos>
 The new Queen lives . <eos>
 Two or three days ! While Lyssa s in their hands ? <eos>
 There s no other way . <eos>
 You have rope ? <eos>
 I am too old to climb down a rope . <eos>
 There s nothing . <eos>
 Reach out farther . Call to her . <eos>
 You have not slept in two days . <eos>
 You choose these ? <eos>
 They know when they are going to die ? <eos>
 I can not reach her . <eos>
 What do you see ? <eos>
 Yes they knew of your first contact so they drove her below . <eos>
 u Why u ? <eos>
 I am not sure . <eos>
 But you suspect . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He has come for Lyssa . <eos>
 Lyssa ? u Why u ? <eos>
 Like you she has extraordinary powers . He would make her his Queen . <eos>
 Can she be forced ? <eos>
 No . She must agree of her own free will . <eos>
 Then we must reach her before she feels that pain . <eos>
 From here I must go alone . <eos>
 She must make a glaive . <eos>
 The spiral begins in the west . <eos>
 I chose the wrong passage . <eos>
 She can see the Beast ! <eos>
 Use your sword . <eos>
 What use s my sword ? I can not reach her ! <eos>
 You must move quickly . The Beast will stop at nothing now . <eos>
 You are coming with us . <eos>
 It s my fate to die in the Fortress . <eos>
 No ! You cannot know that ! <eos>
 I can . Because I choose it . <eos>
 How did you know ? <eos>
 Slayers ! <eos>
 Do not let the waters touch you . <eos>
 They can be saddled . <eos>
 You have done it ? <eos>
 I road them often in my youth . <eos>
 It s today ? <eos>
 Each to his fate . <eos>
 I know the cruelty of such a fate . <eos>
 Perhaps you think no man would return to me . <eos>
 Am I not worth returning to ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Am I not beautiful enough to be loved ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Even by you ? <eos>
 You too are lonely . <eos>
 I ache with it . <eos>
 Let me comfort you . <eos>
 I cannot take comfort when she has none . <eos>
 Then give me comfort . Sleep with me tonight . <eos>
 I feel your pain but I cannot betray her . <eos>
 You will not then ? <eos>
 Help ! Help ! I am drowning ! <eos>
 I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction . <eos>
 What business ? <eos>
 Once s enough thank you . <eos>
 I was hoping I might be your friend . <eos>
 My u friend u . <eos>
 You and I will guard the fire . <eos>
 Fame s what you leave to your sons . <eos>
 How did you know I had sons ? <eos>
 Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for . <eos>
 Hah ! You do not know me boy . <eos>
 And where do you lead boy ? <eos>
 To the place where Death lives . <eos>
 It should be an interesting journey then . <eos>
 That I promise you . <eos>
 When did you last sleep boy ? <eos>
 They burn many villages . Even walled cities fall to them . <eos>
 I am not hungry . <eos>
 Not sleepy either ? <eos>
 Well I am not impressed . <eos>
 You have eaten nothing . <eos>
 Hand over your dinner . <eos>
 Go join them . <eos>
 Go . I command you . <eos>
 We could reach it on fire mares . <eos>
 We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise . <eos>
 Subject to the King no doubt . <eos>
 Nothing worse than lower class boors with upper class morals . <eos>
 You ! <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>
 We will meet you at the inn . <eos>
 Ca not I come too ? <eos>
 A venison pie as big as a house . <eos>
 Quell ? <eos>
 My heart stays here . <eos>
 Bread s for peasants and wine makes me sneeze . Got any gumdrops ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Sugarballs ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 What kind of a boy are you ? Boys always have candy . <eos>
 I have a cinnamon bar . <eos>
 You do ? <eos>
 I am hungry . <eos>
 I would wish for a puppy . <eos>
 One puppy ? Why not wish for a hundred ? <eos>
 I only want one . <eos>
 What ? Now you poke me in the nose as well ? <eos>
 Oh she was so beautiful and I was so u ugly u . <eos>
 Would you desert your friends ? <eos>
 Put me down you lout ! <eos>
 What are you doing with my dear ? Stop ! Thieves ! <eos>
 Many villagers are hiding in the forest . They need food . <eos>
 And do you think I live on air ? <eos>
 We have plenty of hares . <eos>
 Food for crows . <eos>
 Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison . <eos>
 Oh my poor stew ! <eos>
 I can not hold the weight of both of you ! <eos>
 Look at its beauty . Look at its grace . <eos>
 He did not join them . They joined him . <eos>
 And who s u he u that they should join u him u ? <eos>
 They will trample him to death ! <eos>
 I do not want your worlds or your slaves . <eos>
 It s a lie ! <eos>
 These walls do not lie ! He will betray you . <eos>
 He will not ! <eos>
 He will come for me . <eos>
 Freylag s stronghold ? <eos>
 It s important to assure the succession . <eos>

 And when you came downstairs what happened ? <eos>
 I saw Brooke standing over his body drenched in his blood . <eos>
 But Mrs . Windham did not have a gun ? <eos>

 Mrs . Windham Vandermark ? <eos>

 Easily said . the raven passed this way hours ago . <eos>
 Heading true north . We continue in that direction . <eos>
 Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course . <eos>

 Nay . I show no pity to imps and fiends . <eos>
 Aye . We be on a quest to set the world aright <eos>
 Can we trust him ? <eos>

 Never show mercy ! <eos>
 Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth ? <eos>

 You must find the ring . It completes the cycle answers the riddle . <eos>
 Well done lad . Stout heart . <eos>
 Barely living from the looks of it . <eos>
 You see ! You see ! <eos>
 We seek to undo the curse . <eos>
 Well done lad . <eos>
 Look at that shot ! Three at once ! I can not miss ! <eos>
 Sweet slippers of Oisin ! <eos>
 Aye . my Lord . <eos>
 How are these ? <eos>
 Dolt ! <eos>
 Greetings my lady the green wood s honored . <eos>
 These for me ? <eos>
 You promised ! <eos>
 Never . <eos>
 But you did . you did ! <eos>
 I may have said perhaps . <eos>
 Liar ! <eos>
 Blackheart . Aptly named . <eos>
 Oh fie . What about the unicorn ? <eos>
 Unicorn ? <eos>
 A promise s a sacred oath . <eos>
 Let s rest a minute . I am so thirsty . <eos>
 Stop complaining . <eos>
 A gentleman would offer water . <eos>
 Only were he a fool to boot . See yon viper ? <eos>
 I detest serpents . <eos>
 That viper has envenomed the water . No animal will drink here now . <eos>
 What shall we do ? <eos>
 Oh dear . <eos>
 I am not its master . <eos>
 The napkin will keep . I would rather not be alone . <eos>
 How much longer ? <eos>
 Shhh ! <eos>
 Such grace . and their smell it s ambrosia . <eos>
 They rival the angels of paradise . <eos>
 Oh Jack might not I touch one ? It would thrill me so . <eos>
 Are you honest ? <eos>
 He will not flee if I show myself ? <eos>
 Not if you be chaste . Tis an awesome test of virginity . <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>
 What happened ? <eos>
 I do not know . They have hurt the unicorn . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 My father and the Baron . <eos>
 They tricked you . <eos>
 My own father . <eos>
 How bad was the unicorn s wound ? <eos>
 It happened so fast . He was hurt and ran away . <eos>
 He did run ? <eos>
 I do not want it on me . <eos>
 Its powers are strong . <eos>
 Not even the birds sing sweet as you . <eos>
 Jack . Green Jack you must not flatter me so . <eos>
 Tis the truth . <eos>
 A maid must beware of flattery . Methinks you want to kiss me . <eos>
 My lady mocks me . <eos>
 I am afraid it may storm . <eos>
 Let it . Have not you a cozy bower we might hide in ? <eos>
 Tis not fit for a princess . <eos>
 Be it fit for your wife Green Jack ? <eos>
 I have no wife . <eos>
 Then perchance you will me . <eos>
 If wishes were horses even beggars would ride . <eos>
 Do you wish it Jack ? Wish you this our wedding band ? <eos>
 Lili ! No ! <eos>
 What have I done ? <eos>
 I thought you were dead . I <eos>
 I was bewitched . it s better this way . <eos>
 No ! I wo not let it happen . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Sunlight . It destroys him . <eos>
 Sunlight ? <eos>
 That s why he goes masked during the day . <eos>
 So he s hiding in the dark . <eos>
 Is what you said about the ring but another dream ? <eos>
 Oh no dearest Jack . I meant every word . <eos>
 Lili . I love you ! <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 Ouch ! Something s biting me . <eos>
 Biting you ? <eos>
 Pinching me ! <eos>
 Pinching ? Where ? <eos>
 Everywhere ! Ow ! <eos>
 Oona ? Do you suppose it s a faerie ? <eos>
 Honored to make your acquaintance . <eos>
 Step lively now ! <eos>

 Here be the death weapon the unicorn s blood dry upon it . <eos>
 Couer de Noir ! A demon if the Devil ever made one . <eos>
 Not very precise directions . <eos>
 Come sit beside me sweet boy and I will draw you a map . <eos>
 Nay . Tempting as your invitation be . Tell me one thing more . <eos>
 Ask away sweet man . <eos>
 What became of the princess ? <eos>

 Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky . <eos>
 She s dead ! <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Dead dead dead . <eos>
 I do not believe you . <eos>
 This s sad news be it true . <eos>
 Do not be sad Jack not with me here to give you cheer . <eos>
 Tis not the time to speak of cheer . <eos>
 You will visit again ? <eos>
 Courage Jack . <eos>
 This s not the time for squabbling . <eos>
 Such a sad world be there no unicorns to brighten it . <eos>
 I would be honored . <eos>
 Only that ? <eos>
 I had no thought of offending you Oona . <eos>
 Do I not please you Jack ? <eos>
 In every way . <eos>
 And am I not fair ? <eos>
 Wondrously so . <eos>

 Tell me I am fair as you did the hag . <eos>
 You are fair as the first new flower of spring . <eos>

 Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind . <eos>

 You are inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion ! <eos>

 Four days . I left to think . <eos>
 What did you do with your dog ? <eos>
 Kurt s been feeding him . <eos>

 I love those doors . <eos>
 Where will you live ? <eos>
 When s school over ? <eos>

 I will be by Saturday to pick him up . <eos>
 He does not want to spend the weekends with you anymore . <eos>
 Thank you for at least sounding sincere . <eos>
 Sounding ? I need help . He s cheap labor . <eos>
 One of you would end up dead . <eos>
 At least we will have a house to show for it . <eos>
 Forget it really . I will survive . <eos>
 I want him with me . <eos>
 Hey hey ! <eos>

 I did say he could go . <eos>
 We are fine . Turkey sandwiches . <eos>
 It makes me sad . <eos>

 Did not you once dream you could lick people well though ? <eos>
 That was not a dream . That was Sam . <eos>
 Oh . with his ear infection ! <eos>
 Go in there and lick his attitude . <eos>
 I have been wrong a lot in my life . <eos>
 With your hands or your tongue ? <eos>
 I thought you would be up with the sun . <eos>
 Where s Sam ? <eos>
 I will find something that wo not kill them . <eos>
 Or wound . Let them keep their eyes and fingers . <eos>
 Do you need help ? <eos>
 It s been a while . <eos>
 Tell him how you made me fall in love with you . <eos>
 I smiled at him . <eos>
 Let s see if you have gotten any better . <eos>
 Maybe you should not come everyday . <eos>

 I thought we were helping . <eos>
 Nothing s going on with us s it ? <eos>

 I did not say that I would run . I just . <eos>
 Are you a 5 or a 6 ? <eos>

 They wo not listen . <eos>
 You think Sandmen will ? There s no other way for me <eos>
 Will you take me with you ? <eos>
 How do we know this s the right way ? <eos>
 I am afraid . <eos>
 It does not make any difference anymore . <eos>

 Do not ! <eos>
 It s getting dark and cold . I am tired . <eos>
 Do you think everything s going to turn to ice ? <eos>

 Heal who ? <eos>
 The innocents we now use to stop the guilty . <eos>
 Not if I stay away from him . <eos>
 How can you avoid a man you have never met ? <eos>
 Jesus Christ why did not I know about this ? <eos>
 Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur . <eos>
 The system would collapse . <eos>
 I believe in that system . <eos>
 I am not gonna kill anybody . <eos>
 Hold that thought . <eos>
 What safe place s that ? <eos>
 If . you have one . <eos>

 It s always in the more gifted of the three . <eos>

 And there s the Sphinx . <eos>
 And a social life . <eos>

 Yes who spoke up ? <eos>
 Yes Captain ? Have you anything you wish to say ? <eos>
 Yes with all due respect I do Citizen Barras . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 Thank you for coming . Would you care for a drink ? <eos>
 I do not have to tell you of our latest difficulties . <eos>
 What do you have in mind ? <eos>
 To be perfectly honest I have not the vaguest idea . <eos>
 Are you serious ? <eos>
 I do not even know whether a defense s possible . <eos>
 What forces do you have at your disposal ? <eos>
 About 5000 troops . <eos>
 Cavalry ? <eos>
 The 21st Dragoons about two or three hundred troopers . <eos>
 Any cannon ? <eos>
 There are none here . <eos>
 Where are they ? <eos>
 Well I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons . <eos>
 You could have them here by daybreak . <eos>
 Is this enough to oppose 40000 men ? <eos>
 Properly arranged yes . <eos>
 Would you be prepared to handle this for me ? <eos>
 I am not insulted . <eos>
 You realize what s at stake ? <eos>
 They are at the gates of Paris sire . <eos>
 And where s the army ? <eos>
 It s on this road sire following me . <eos>
 Paris has surrendered ? I do not believe it . <eos>
 Who sent my wife and son out of Paris ? <eos>
 I do not know sire . <eos>
 And where s Joseph ? <eos>

 Bertrand sire . <eos>

 General Bonaparte ? <eos>

 Yes sir . <eos>
 Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip ? <eos>
 Thank you sir . I will do that . <eos>
 Yes sir ? <eos>

 Bastia and you ? <eos>

 Why are you carrying the dog ? <eos>
 His paws are frozen and he cannot walk . <eos>
 My God . What time s it ? <eos>
 Four o clock . <eos>
 When did it start ? <eos>
 The first reports came in at about ten . <eos>
 Why did not you wake me then ? <eos>
 At first it hardly seemed more than a routine fire . <eos>
 How did it spread so quickly ? <eos>
 It s the work of incendiaries . <eos>
 I beg your indulgence Ambassador but it is . <eos>
 The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess Marie Louise . <eos>
 Good morning Citizen de Beauharnais . <eos>
 Good morning sir . Are you General Bonaparte ? <eos>
 I am Citizen . Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais ? <eos>

 Does your mother know you have come ? <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 Shall we move closer to the fire ? <eos>
 Will Alexander be joining us soon ? <eos>
 I very much doubt that he will . <eos>
 My dear Francis you do seem extremely uncomfortable . <eos>
 I am afraid I am just a bit . <eos>
 Would you like some brandy ? <eos>

 Good evening sir . <eos>

 The comedy of my marriage s sufficiently well known already . <eos>
 You must not act impetuously . <eos>
 Are you sure that you are not still in love with her ? <eos>
 Are you trying to insult me ? <eos>
 Of course not but such violence of feeling makes me wonder . <eos>
 Well you shall see . <eos>
 Will you use the troops ? <eos>
 Ah that s good . <eos>

 I cannot promise you that . <eos>
 Promise me . <eos>

 Late summer . <eos>
 Congratulations . <eos>
 It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month . <eos>
 You call that a compliment ? <eos>
 Next time we will bring more blankets . <eos>
 That would be nice . <eos>
 Maybe we will be lucky this winter and have just rain no snow . <eos>
 You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia ? <eos>
 Personally I would prefer stupidity . <eos>
 He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly . <eos>
 What do you mean old and ugly ? <eos>
 You got me beat on both accounts . <eos>
 He should not make light . That Redcoat should not have been killed . <eos>
 You do not know him very well do you ? <eos>
 You got salt last week . <eos>
 They are from good stock on their mother s side . <eos>
 You look well Charlotte . <eos>
 And send us to war alongside Massachusetts . <eos>
 How did this . how did I let this happen ? <eos>
 Excuse me ? <eos>

 Do you ? <eos>
 Of course I do . <eos>
 Goodbye Charlotte . <eos>
 Two pounds fourteen ounces . <eos>
 You are surrendering . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 What unit ? <eos>
 First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton . <eos>
 We did . <eos>
 My pleasure sir . <eos>
 Please forgive me for keeping you waiting . <eos>
 Apology accepted . <eos>
 Thank you Colonel . I am afraid I do not know your name . <eos>
 Colonel will do . <eos>
 I am familiar with how a formal negotiation s handled . <eos>
 Oh ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Restrain them from the targeting of civilians including women and children ? <eos>
 That s a separate issue . <eos>
 Very well let us move on to . <eos>
 Prisoner exchange . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 My harrier . Join us Colonel . <eos>
 Colonel Tarleton you deal with these damned rebels . <eos>
 It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley . <eos>
 Are you going to meet with him ? <eos>
 If I fail you fail . <eos>
 Perhaps . <eos>
 And if I triumph you triumph . <eos>
 Probably . <eos>
 How can we end this madness ? <eos>
 Civility s a secondary virtue . It s superseded by duty . <eos>
 Do you see that Colonel ? <eos>
 Father a post rider came from Charleston . You have a letter inside . <eos>
 The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved . <eos>
 Anything about the convention in Philadelphia ? <eos>
 Is that why the Assembly was convened ? <eos>
 Yes . He seeks a levy of troops and money . <eos>
 When you have children I hope you will understand . <eos>
 Do you intend to enlist without my permission ? <eos>
 Have you seen any Redcoats ? <eos>
 I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro . <eos>
 You are in no condition to ride . <eos>
 Father . <eos>
 We would cover more ground if we split up . <eos>
 Is that so ? <eos>
 Did your father teach you humility ? <eos>
 And Corporal . . be careful . <eos>
 How old are you ? <eos>
 You know how old I am . <eos>
 Flanking riders ? <eos>
 These four wagons must be his . <eos>
 Lord Cornwallis s brilliant . His weakness s that he knows it . <eos>
 Father ? <eos>
 Fourteen dead eleven wounded eighteen captured . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 She would say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan . <eos>
 You learned her lessons better than I . <eos>
 She spoke ? Susan spoke ? <eos>
 Full sentences . As if she had been speaking all along . <eos>
 Father there s something else I need to talk to you about . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Sir I would like to request a furlough . Two days ? <eos>
 Granted . Where are you going ? <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Do not go in there . <eos>
 Is it her ? Is Anne in there ? <eos>
 Father tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness ? <eos>
 You know what happened . <eos>
 Tell me what everyone does not know . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 I see do as I say not as I do . <eos>
 He wanted to Susan but he could not leave his men . <eos>
 There are some letters here from him . Some are just to you . <eos>
 I do not care . I hate him . <eos>
 An American nation . Colonel Lee with your permission ? <eos>
 I stand corrected . <eos>
 Captain Marion I understood you to be a Patriot . <eos>
 It s Mister Marion . <eos>
 A long time ago . <eos>
 Thirteen years . <eos>
 You were an Englishman then . <eos>
 We do not have to go to war to gain independence . <eos>
 Balderdash ! <eos>
 There are a thousand avenues other than war at our disposal . <eos>
 Name five hundred . <eos>
 Royal petition delegates to court judicial redress economic boycott bribery . <eos>
 That s five keep going . <eos>
 . time royal succession regicide bribery . <eos>
 And your principles ? <eos>
 One of yours ? <eos>
 No thank the Lord . He s more like his mother . <eos>
 I will see to it that he serves under me . <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>
 I am sorry I was not here for this . <eos>
 There s nothing you could have done Gates s a damned fool . <eos>
 Who s in command ? <eos>
 I am I think . <eos>
 When ? <eos>
 Fall six months at the earliest . <eos>
 You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia ? <eos>
 They would be better off but the cause would not be . <eos>
 His wife was killed yesterday . She was with child . <eos>
 Do not touch him . <eos>
 How many men have we seen die ? <eos>
 Goodbye Francis . <eos>
 And congratulations on the birth of your son . <eos>
 Thank you . Maybe all of this will buy him some peace . <eos>
 Your son what did you name him ? <eos>
 Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 You may of course keep your weapons but I must warn you that . <eos>
 I am familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley . <eos>
 Yes quite but you should know that . <eos>
 That will be all Major . I will wait for Lord Cornwallis . <eos>
 How far away ? <eos>
 But what about Thomas ? <eos>
 Reverend . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 For trying to impose some decency on that sort . <eos>
 How many came back ? <eos>
 He looks as if he s sleeping does not he ? <eos>
 Gray . <eos>
 I was sorry to hear about your son . <eos>
 Francis tell me about General Cornwallis . <eos>
 Remember Braddock ? <eos>
 That bad ? <eos>
 Worse . <eos>
 Not yet Thomas . <eos>
 Put those away . <eos>
 But father they might come this way . <eos>
 Father I saw a post rider at the house . <eos>
 Father ? <eos>
 Father you can not let them take him . <eos>
 Father . I killed those men . <eos>
 Do not blame yourself you did what I told you to do . <eos>
 But where are we going Mr . Crandall ? <eos>
 Bite ? <eos>

 They do it to honor the dead Ellen . <eos>
 It s gorgeous ! <eos>
 Yes but the rope might be <eos>
 Honey Church will be fine . <eos>
 I want to fly it ! Can I fly it now mommy ! <eos>
 Paxcow says it s almost too late ! <eos>
 Paxcow says Daddy s going to do something really bad . He <eos>
 Who s this Paxcow ? Is he like the boogeyman ? <eos>
 Will you at least call and make sure daddy s okay ? <eos>
 Please hurry . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 No I guess not . <eos>
 Have you got a death wish Ellen ? <eos>
 I want to look around daddy may I ? <eos>
 And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot . <eos>
 Good God ! Where would you hear that ? <eos>
 Is he really all right ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Because you promised . <eos>
 I have noticed it too . I will cough up the money Ellen . <eos>
 Ellie ? What s wrong ? <eos>
 No more chocolate chip cookies . <eos>
 What s up sugar ? <eos>
 But do not you dare say that . <eos>
 You believe in it . <eos>
 I am not tired ! <eos>
 I am sure you are not . <eos>
 Then why do I have to go to bed ? <eos>
 Be good to your mother darlin . She needs you . <eos>
 Do you swear ? <eos>
 Jud Crandall . I live just across the road . <eos>
 You need a glass ? <eos>
 Not at all . <eos>
 What were you listening to ? <eos>
 Allman Brothers . <eos>
 You folks ready to go on ? <eos>
 Not yet . how much further s it ? <eos>
 It s Church . <eos>
 I am sorry . At least it do not look like he suffered . <eos>
 Loved that cat pretty well did not she ? <eos>
 Bagged cat . What a mess . <eos>
 Going to tell Ellie ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 But <eos>
 Does she love the cat ? <eos>
 Yes but <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 I am not climbing that . <eos>
 Yes . Where are we going Jud ? <eos>
 Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp . <eos>
 Is there quicksand ? <eos>
 There s a lot of funny things down this way Louis . <eos>
 Almost there Louis . <eos>
 You keep saying that . <eos>
 This was their burying ground Louis . <eos>
 Whose burying ground ? <eos>
 The Micmac Indians . I brought you here to bury Ellen s cat . <eos>
 Why ? For God s sake why ? <eos>
 I had my reasons Louis . We will talk later . All right ? <eos>
 I guess so . but . <eos>
 What are those for ? <eos>
 Does not look like they last long . <eos>
 Do not worry about that . <eos>
 Jud why am I doing all this ? <eos>
 Can I have another one ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Rachel not feeling well ? <eos>
 Out of the mouths of babes Louis . <eos>
 Ayuh . how s your cat Louis ? <eos>
 It s Ellie s cat . <eos>
 You are thinking of things best not thought of Louis . <eos>
 but I think the thought has crossed your mind . <eos>
 Shit ! Look at this mess ! <eos>
 Because something called a wendigo soured the ground . <eos>
 Leave me alone ! <eos>
 The door must not be opened . The barrier must not be crossed . <eos>
 Let her go . It s cool . <eos>
 And Buckaroo Banzai . <eos>
 Gage s gone ! <eos>
 Thank you . Thank you so much . <eos>
 The movers <eos>
 My God ! <eos>
 I think it s rather extraordinary . <eos>
 She s finally asleep . <eos>
 That s enough of that kind of talk ! <eos>
 I just said <eos>
 Well honey . you know that . <eos>
 Getting there . <eos>
 I got eggs down here ! <eos>
 I am going to try to do better . <eos>
 You better get going hon . <eos>
 Louis are you sure ? <eos>
 You stole my boat . <eos>
 My dory . The Jolly Mon . Where s it ? <eos>
 Safe ! At Port Royal . With the Royal Navy . <eos>
 That boat s my livelihood ! <eos>
 You will get it back . Or one better . <eos>
 AnaMaria trim the mainsail ! <eos>
 What s in your head boy ? <eos>
 She . Goes . Free . <eos>
 You have got one shot and we can not die . <eos>
 Enough of that ! Name your terms . <eos>
 Elizabeth goes free ! <eos>
 I know whose blood you need to end the curse . <eos>
 Say the name or I slit your throat . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 I will torture it out of you . <eos>
 Blast you ! I will throw you in prison . <eos>
 So how did you get off that island anyway ? <eos>
 You can go to your grave not knowing . <eos>
 No I really think I do . <eos>
 The situation has changed . <eos>
 Now you can take care of the Dauntless right ? <eos>
 There s . another exit ? <eos>
 Now ? <eos>
 Do you believe him ? <eos>
 I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request . Means No . <eos>
 You have a name missy ? <eos>
 You have got sand for a maid . <eos>
 Maid or not it fits you . <eos>
 Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner ? <eos>
 Oh there would be no sense in killing you Miss Turner . <eos>
 Then why are not you eating ? <eos>
 Do you not know what this s then ? <eos>
 It s a pirate medallion . <eos>
 Agreed . You have my word as a gentleman of fortune <eos>
 Man overboard ! <eos>
 Boy overboard ! <eos>
 Did he speak ? <eos>
 His name s Will Turner that s all I found out . <eos>
 I can not breathe . <eos>
 Commodore you can not do that ! <eos>
 Elizabeth I hereby withdraw my proposal . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Then I can wear men s clothing . <eos>
 Elizabeth ? Is everything all right ? Are you decent ? <eos>
 Although . I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today . <eos>
 Ceremony ? <eos>
 Difficult . to say . <eos>
 I am told that dress s the very latest fashion in London . <eos>
 Elizabeth this s hardly appropriate <eos>
 You will be dining with the Captain and he requests you wear this . <eos>
 I could never forget it Miss Swann . <eos>
 Will how many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth ? <eos>
 I am glad we got here in time . <eos>
 If I had known <eos>
 I can not believe he would make such a sacrifice for us . <eos>
 Elizabeth I think it does not matter that we are of a different class <eos>
 It does not ! <eos>
 Miss Swann . <eos>
 You are despicable . <eos>
 You ? <eos>
 Me ! <eos>
 You are in league with Barbossa ! <eos>
 Has it changed since the last time you were here ? <eos>
 Captain Sparrow ! We have to get off this island immediately ! <eos>
 Drink up me hearties yo ho . <eos>
 Well perhaps . with a bit more to drink I might . <eos>
 To freedom . <eos>
 You did not tell Commodore Norrington everything . <eos>
 Nor did you I noticed . <eos>
 He might delay the rescue . and that would be too late . <eos>
 Exactly . <eos>
 A fool s errand . <eos>
 Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants . Something he needs . <eos>
 Kid s a bit of a stick s not he ? <eos>
 We would best drop canvas sir ! <eos>
 What s in your head to put you in such a fine mood ? <eos>
 How did you get off the island ? <eos>
 Blast it I am already awake ! <eos>
 We are not going to just surrender ! <eos>
 We can at least fight we might be able to kill a few <eos>
 All the men in place sir . Ready to fire . <eos>
 Sir ! Shall I break out the cannons ? <eos>
 This dock s off limits to civilians . <eos>
 What s your name ? <eos>
 Well well . Jack Sparrow s not it ? <eos>
 But it seems to be enough to condemn him . <eos>
 We had time to get to know each other . <eos>
 You would do that ? <eos>
 They left me stranded . Twice . What have you got to lose ? <eos>
 Nothing I would not be please to be rid of . <eos>
 You look familiar . Have I ever threatened you before ? <eos>
 Do you think this s wise boy ? Crossing blades with a pirate ? <eos>
 You threatened Miss Swann . <eos>
 You cheated . <eos>
 Move away . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Move ! <eos>
 Are you familiar with that ship ? The Black Pearl ? <eos>
 Somewhat . <eos>
 Why ask me ? <eos>
 Because you are a pirate . <eos>
 And you want to turn pirate yourself ? <eos>
 I can get you out of here . <eos>
 Agreed . <eos>
 Not without my effects . <eos>
 I would die for her . <eos>
 We are going to steal a ship ? That ship ? <eos>
 Commandeer . We are going to commandeer a ship . Nautical term . <eos>
 This s either crazy or brilliant . <eos>
 Everybody stay calm . We are taking over the ship ! <eos>
 Is that so ? <eos>
 That s not true . <eos>
 I swear you look just like him . <eos>
 It s not true my father was a pirate . <eos>
 My father did not think of my mother his family as a burden . <eos>
 Sure because he could always go pirating . <eos>
 Tortuga ? <eos>
 Just do it quickly . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Depends . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Do you have any idea where you are going ? <eos>
 Jack ! <eos>
 Are you certain this s the right way ? <eos>
 There s no real ship as can match the Interceptor . <eos>
 The Black Pearl s a real ship . <eos>
 No it s not . <eos>
 Yes it is . I have seen it . <eos>
 You have seen it ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You have seen the Black Pearl ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You have not seen it . <eos>
 . No . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 . no . <eos>
 What s your business in Port Royal Mr . Smith ? <eos>
 I think he s telling the truth . <eos>
 He s not telling the truth . <eos>
 He may be . <eos>
 That Jack Sparrow . he talked about the Black Pearl . <eos>
 Mentioned it s more what he did . <eos>
 He s still breathing . <eos>
 What happened here ? <eos>
 Has my daughter given you an answer yet ? <eos>
 No . She has not . <eos>
 Well she had a very taxing day . Ghastly weather tonight . <eos>
 Commodore <eos>
 A moment . <eos>
 But <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 How long do you leave him in there ? <eos>
 Speak . <eos>
 Wheelchair accessible . <eos>
 You can not mean that . <eos>
 Something to drink Dr . Bright ? <eos>
 What are you going to do to him ? <eos>
 I should kill you right now for what you did to me ! <eos>
 How apropos . <eos>
 I know what you are doing . <eos>
 You mean besides kicking your ass ? <eos>
 Like rotting meat . <eos>
 It s ready now I know it is . <eos>
 She says it s not . <eos>
 She s lying . She lost the first one on purpose . <eos>
 She did not . The mouse ran down the drain . <eos>
 Icky ! What s happening ? <eos>
 Do you think she will give us the designs ? <eos>
 Eventually . These things are always a matter of leverage . <eos>
 And you think O Brien s that leverage ? <eos>
 And you still believe he s going to come here ? <eos>
 Based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable . <eos>
 Poppy are you in one of your moods again ? <eos>
 Why are there two ottomans ? <eos>
 Yes . Yes of course it is . <eos>
 Then you still love me ? <eos>
 Icarus ? <eos>
 I promise my dear I will give the matter some consideration . <eos>
 Consideration ? <eos>
 It will be an ascension . <eos>
 I was wondering if you would finished considering ? <eos>
 Considering what ? <eos>
 Poppy please <eos>
 If you loved me like I loved you ? <eos>
 Did you feel that ? <eos>
 Did I ? I have been waiting for that for years . <eos>
 Well yes . The replicators are not as active at low temperatures . <eos>
 Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control . <eos>
 She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys . <eos>
 Where did he go ? <eos>
 They are here ! They are here ! We have the nanobot . <eos>
 Excellent work Dr . Nebbleman . You have outdone yourself . <eos>
 Wait wait can I at least have his body ? <eos>
 Hey ! <eos>
 You do not want this . <eos>
 Yeah I do ! <eos>
 You have no idea what this s doing to your body . <eos>
 What are you going to do ? Make me throw it out ? <eos>
 What ? Oh I am sorry Nigel . I was just thinking . <eos>
 A man ? <eos>
 Yeah . I knew him when I was still in school . <eos>
 Yeah . But it was not a group . It was one man . <eos>
 What did security say ? <eos>
 They will in validate the key . Probably nothing . <eos>
 Well you got another problem . <eos>
 You were never invited to my house . <eos>
 I do not believe this s happening . <eos>
 Susan Dr . Argon s giving you an opportunity here . <eos>
 Is that what Argon told you ? <eos>
 No ! Well not those exact words . <eos>
 You are afraid of him . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 What s it smell like ? <eos>
 Smell ? Uh something like methylcyanoacrylate . <eos>
 Sir please try to hold still . <eos>
 Susan ! <eos>
 Daniel . <eos>
 When did you . <eos>
 Been out for six months now . <eos>
 Really ? What have you been doing ? <eos>
 Somebody has to . <eos>
 The big house ? <eos>
 I guess I should be flattered . <eos>
 I remember you said nanotechnology was going to change the world . <eos>
 It already is . <eos>
 I have read they are using it to repair cancer cells . <eos>
 And for cleaning up oil spills . <eos>
 Nothing really worthwhile . <eos>
 Yeah we will see . <eos>
 Daniel give him the Trix . <eos>
 Susie ! You gotta help me ! <eos>
 Daniel what are you doing here ? <eos>
 Please Susan ! I need help ! Something s wrong with me ! <eos>
 Sorry Daniel I am a physicist not a psychiatrist . <eos>
 They did it to me ! <eos>
 . just like the mouse . <eos>
 Mouse ? What mouse ? <eos>
 My first organic polymerization was a lab mouse . <eos>
 What happened to it ? <eos>
 You do not know ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Daniel ! <eos>
 We do not have time for hysterics . <eos>
 What are these ? <eos>
 Mostly caffeine diuretics . Help you go to the bathroom . <eos>
 Why do we need it ? <eos>
 The nanobot s the only thing that can stabilize the waste . <eos>
 Got it . <eos>
 The problem s the by product created by the process . <eos>
 The replicators start off like assemblers but the replicators never stabilize . <eos>
 That was an egg ? <eos>
 Three days ago it was . <eos>
 What do these replicators do to people ? <eos>
 So right now there s little replicators spreading throughout Argon s lab ? <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Is something wrong ? <eos>
 Susan ! <eos>
 Look at this ! <eos>
 What s that supposed to mean ? <eos>
 Just giving credit where credit s due . <eos>
 You have no one to blame but yourself . <eos>
 You are not protecting the world you are obstructing progress ! <eos>
 But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate ! <eos>
 Come on I do not see you living in a cave ! <eos>
 Just like old times . <eos>
 I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me . <eos>
 I feel very emotional right now . A bit out of control . <eos>
 Probably the caffeine . <eos>
 Do you have something to bring me down ? <eos>
 Uh oh . I remember that temper . <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 The nanobot . it s not here . <eos>
 How far can you stretch ? <eos>
 What did you want my hair for ? <eos>
 No cheese . <eos>
 That s pretty good . <eos>
 That s going to fit me ? <eos>
 Did you go ? <eos>
 Who s he ? <eos>
 I do not believe it . You are here ! Oh thank God . <eos>
 Where s it ? <eos>
 Argon s private lab . <eos>
 Run Daniel ! Get out of here ! <eos>
 You saved my life . <eos>
 What in the . <eos>
 Oh shit the meltdown . It s spread to the tower . <eos>
 We have got to get the nanobot . <eos>
 It s too late . Argon injected it . <eos>
 That means the nanobot s still inside him . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What would happen if I threw him into the core ? <eos>
 You are not going after Argon ! <eos>
 I remember I was trying to help . <eos>
 God what a fight that was . <eos>
 Things do change . <eos>
 What ? I am not going anywhere ! <eos>
 Only this s not no tranquilizer gun . Now let s go ! <eos>
 You were looking for us ? <eos>
 Yeah I have something I have been meaning to give you . <eos>
 Yeah and what might that be ? <eos>
 All the different ways that I could kill you . <eos>
 That s impossible . <eos>
 Mrs . Argon ? It s Sim . <eos>
 Mr . Sim ? Do you have him ? He s alive ? <eos>
 Oh yeah he s alive . Technically . <eos>
 And you have him ? <eos>
 Vermin . <eos>
 I am aware of Dr . Argon s frustrations . <eos>
 I could have you fired right now . <eos>
 Icky ! <eos>
 Okay Barbie let s get this over with . <eos>
 It might be paranoia but I have never lost my keycard before . <eos>
 What in the hell ? <eos>
 Yes it will be a very interesting experiment . <eos>
 To make a gentleman out of a tramp ? <eos>
 Well what else do you expect them to call you ? <eos>
 Indeed ? How interesting . <eos>

 Welcome to Charenton Abbe du Maupas . <eos>
 and the listless ones do the binding . <eos>
 It s remarkable Doctor . The patients are so subdued so docile . <eos>
 We ought not be reading his nasty stories <eos>
 You have been to his quarters have not you ? <eos>
 He s a writer not a madman . <eos>
 At your service Count . <eos>
 To seal the wound he took a poker from the fire <eos>
 Madeleine <eos>
 Has he hurt you ? <eos>
 Do not say that reading s my salvation . <eos>
 Ow ! <eos>
 In part yes . <eos>
 Charenton has changed it s not safe for you here . <eos>
 Do not turn us out Abbe . <eos>
 By whom ? The Marquis ? <eos>
 Go back to your room . Quickly . <eos>
 What ? What have I done ? <eos>
 Do not come back not tonight not again <eos>
 Free his mouth . <eos>
 Must not do that sir . <eos>
 I must grant him his last rites . <eos>
 I do not take my orders from you not anymore . <eos>
 Care for a splash of wine Abbe ? <eos>
 I am entertaining you now are not I ? <eos>
 I am not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption . <eos>
 Yes ! It is ! The paper s cheap the type s too small <eos>
 Enough to discern its tenor . <eos>
 They can not be serious . <eos>
 Our future lies in the stroke of your pen . <eos>
 You mean to take us all down with you ? <eos>
 He can not do that to me . <eos>
 I have a proposition . <eos>
 I do not know who you insult more her or me . <eos>
 Part the gates of heaven as it were <eos>
 That s enough . <eos>
 You are tense darling . You could use a long slow screw . <eos>
 Good day Marquis . <eos>
 My bed gone ! Am I to freeze to death ? <eos>
 Virgin birth ha ! An entire religion built on an oxymoron ! <eos>
 Orvolle . His wine . From now on nothing but water at every meal <eos>
 water ! <eos>
 WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE ? <eos>
 If it were up to the Doctor you would be flayed alive . <eos>
 I could be convinced to abandon my writing quite voluntarily . <eos>
 What on earth would that require ? <eos>
 A night spent with the partner of my choice . <eos>
 You expect me to pimp Madeleine ? <eos>
 OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES ! <eos>
 Coulmier you animal ! <eos>
 I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT MARQUIS ! <eos>
 Oh but you must my pumpkin ! Sex without flirtation s merely rape ! <eos>
 It s a potent aphrodisiac s not it ? Power over another man . <eos>
 Oh I am to be blamed now am I ? <eos>
 It s no secret that you loved her . <eos>
 Oh that s rich coming from her lapdog <eos>
 I saw the longing in your eye <eos>
 that was lust <eos>
 Do not confuse one organ with another <eos>
 I know because I felt it myself <eos>
 I WANTED TO FUCK HER THAT S ALL ! <eos>
 AND DID YOU ? <eos>
 Go to hell ! <eos>
 Why was it you never took her by force ? <eos>
 Who s to say I did not ? <eos>
 Was it impotence ? <eos>
 NEVER ! <eos>
 Abbe de Coulmier ! <eos>
 I am here . <eos>
 Surely you will grant me a final word . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction . <eos>
 Why s he in your care and not a proper prison ? <eos>
 His wife s influence . <eos>
 His wife s ? <eos>
 Oh . That . <eos>
 Do you favor its publication ? <eos>
 Shut down ? <eos>
 In their eyes the Marquis s the surest barometer of your progress here . <eos>
 On the contrary . Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 I have . <eos>
 Madame Bougival Mademoiselle Clairwil and of course the Marquis wife <eos>
 It was fiction of course . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It was not inspired by circumstance . <eos>
 You will get more from her with kindness than you will with force . <eos>
 He will do no such thing . <eos>
 It s a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children <eos>
 If only blood will appease you then shed mine . <eos>
 Perhaps you will be so kind as to remind me of her name . <eos>
 I beg you Doctor do not make me say it . <eos>
 My my . You have exceeded my expectations . <eos>
 And my own . <eos>
 How s the patient faring ? <eos>
 Poorly . <eos>
 Will you sleep soundly tonight ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 I will be waiting . <eos>
 You asked my name once it s Madeleine . <eos>
 It s not your cup of tea Mama . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 I am only a laundress not a detective . <eos>
 I am hungry for a proper visit . <eos>
 Do not start <eos>
 It s the only frontier I have left plumcake . <eos>
 If only these coins purchased your other talents too . <eos>
 Your publisher says I am not to leave without a new manuscript . <eos>
 Is it awfully violent ? <eos>
 Most assuredly . <eos>
 Is it terribly erotic ? <eos>
 A kiss for each page . <eos>
 Must I administer them directly or might I blow them ? <eos>
 The price my coquette s every bit as firm as I am . <eos>
 It s a long story this one . <eos>
 The climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap . <eos>
 The story s thrilling conclusion comes at a premium . <eos>
 They have taken your clothes ? <eos>
 Surely you have seen a man naked . <eos>
 I must say in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations . <eos>
 It need not be not if you have another story . <eos>
 How do you propose I write it ? With dust upon the air ? <eos>
 Yes that s it ! A final volley from us both ! <eos>
 Yes ! You shall . Of course you shall <eos>
 A tale more horrible than all the rest combined ! <eos>
 You would do that rather than forsake our love ? <eos>
 It s customary to write first and request an appointment <eos>
 Desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy . <eos>
 It s tainted money Doctor . <eos>
 What a beautiful thought Marquise . <eos>
 What thought s that ? <eos>
 Oh but I am ! <eos>
 words alone are insufficient . <eos>
 I am eternally in your debt . <eos>
 And I in yours . <eos>
 Doctor . Can I impart to you his cruelest trick ? <eos>
 Hm ? Tell me . What other treats ? <eos>
 You have come to lecture me ? <eos>
 To flaunt your deviance in public ? Upon a stage ? <eos>
 They have put you up to this have not they ? <eos>
 Leave at once <eos>
 But it s just begun <eos>
 Does not that please you ? <eos>
 I would rather read thank you . <eos>
 Ever met Walter Winchell ? <eos>
 No when I was but a tender lad <eos>
 So you ever gonna do a picture ? <eos>
 Not you too <eos>
 It s gonna be fine Orson . You are gonna do great . <eos>
 I wonder sometimes . <eos>
 You are just scared . <eos>
 God these parties are the worst <eos>
 And attractive in a hammy sort of way . <eos>
 I can not <eos>
 Sure you can just <eos>
 I did my best but well you know me <eos>
 Yeah . But all of a sudden it s not <eos>
 You know this CITIZEN KANE picture ? About Pops and everything ? <eos>
 Uh huh <eos>
 The character that s supposed to be me Susan Alexander <eos>
 Marion everyone knows you are not like that <eos>
 Who are you sir ? <eos>
 My name s Orson Welles <eos>
 The actor <eos>
 And director . <eos>
 I see . And you are in California for what reason ? <eos>
 Well I wish you luck . It s a treacherous business . <eos>
 So I have been told . <eos>
 In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed . <eos>
 I wonder . Do you have any idea what you have done ? <eos>
 Louis <eos>
 Randolph ! <eos>
 Mm . Not a very good picture I am told . <eos>
 You know that can not happen . <eos>
 Oh why s that ? <eos>
 Why s that Louis ? <eos>
 See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture wo not you ? <eos>
 Goddamn it . I gotta have some kinda life ! <eos>
 There s no call for that language <eos>
 The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today . <eos>
 How bad s it ? <eos>
 Nothing for you to worry about darling <eos>
 How much ? <eos>
 It s not really <eos>
 We are 125 million dollars in debt ? <eos>
 How does one get 125 million dollars in debt ? <eos>
 Nailed us hub ? The crazy old man and his whore . <eos>
 This picture <eos>
 Then you explain it to me ? <eos>
 We are in no pickle as you would euphemistically have it . <eos>
 You gotta wake up now . Pops . <eos>
 That did you need that ? How much did that cost ? <eos>
 It s 12th Century . From Deauville in France . <eos>
 I know where Deauville s for C C Christ s sake . <eos>
 You need not use that language with me <eos>
 Did you need it ? Did you need any of it ? <eos>
 I wanted it <eos>
 There s a different between want and <eos>
 That s right . You have captured me exactly . Goodnight . <eos>
 You will not walk out on me <eos>
 You are repellant when you drink . <eos>
 Fuck you Mr . Kane . <eos>
 I will not have this in my home . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Thank you for your time <eos>
 Miss Parsons I have one additional question for you . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Why did we not know about this sooner ? <eos>
 Sir I <eos>
 He lied to me <eos>
 He looked into my face and told me it was not about you . <eos>
 Keep filming . <eos>
 I can not remember the lines ! <eos>
 We are using <eos>
 You are not doin Hearst are you ? <eos>
 Good God no ! The character s a delicious amalgamation of various press barons <eos>
 Schaefer I gotta see this Welles picture <eos>

 Nix sweetie . You shelve it <eos>
 Can I talk to Hearst ? <eos>
 What are movies about Orson ? <eos>
 Forget it <eos>
 What are movies about ? <eos>
 Telling stories . <eos>
 Nope . <eos>
 That s better than being the oldest has been in Hollywood history . <eos>
 So we have got to come up with our movie . Our biography . <eos>
 Right <eos>
 We find the man and then we dissect him <eos>
 Like a bug . <eos>
 But with compassion and insight <eos>
 Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow ? <eos>
 Manolete ? <eos>
 Who the hell s Manolete ? <eos>
 The great Spanish bullfighter <eos>
 The man does not allow drinking or cigars ? This s monstrous . <eos>
 The whole joint s half the size of Rhode Island . <eos>
 Mank ! You scoundrel ! What took you so long ? <eos>
 Here you are up with the birds for once you vampire ! <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Please do not say this . <eos>
 Mank <eos>
 So speaks the court jester . <eos>
 Fuck you <eos>
 I expected more from you . <eos>
 Let me out . <eos>
 Listen to me <eos>
 He will destroy us . <eos>
 So who s he ? We have to know him . <eos>
 Everyone sees someone different . That s what we show . <eos>
 Why her ? <eos>
 It s 350 pages long . <eos>
 Yeah but the margins are real wide . <eos>
 Cain like the Bible guy ? <eos>
 K A N E . One strong syllable . Kane I <eos>
 Craig s one syllable <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 I want you back <eos>
 Fuck you . You wanted me out . I am out . <eos>

 Hedy Lamarr ? <eos>
 Is that from one of the Gospels ? <eos>
 You gonna watch ? <eos>
 Hell I know how it ends . Hey Rosebud s the sled ! <eos>
 Shit <eos>
 He truly does not care if he ever works again . <eos>
 And they went to the stockholders in New York . <eos>
 Thank you b b but I would really like t t to <eos>
 To do what ? <eos>

 Excuse me I am talking to my sister in law . <eos>
 This s the baby sitter . <eos>
 Does he have your number Mr . Jefferies ? <eos>
 He has it . Thank you . <eos>
 This could go off in a month or an hour . <eos>
 Jefferies ? <eos>
 Name me a better photographer . <eos>
 But his leg ! <eos>
 I would say that s looked as if she was not coming back . <eos>
 You think I made all this up ? <eos>
 I think you saw something that probably has a very simple explanation . <eos>
 For instance ? <eos>
 His wife took a trip . <eos>
 She was an invalid ! <eos>
 You told me . I have got to run Jeff . <eos>
 By the way what happened to your leg ? <eos>
 I think they missed their chance with her . <eos>
 She never left the apartment <eos>
 Then where s she in the ice box ? <eos>
 until yesterday morning . <eos>
 What time ? <eos>
 Feel a little foolish ? <eos>
 Who said they left then ? <eos>
 Who left where ? <eos>
 Doyle are you interested in solving a case or making me look foolish ? <eos>
 By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment . <eos>
 You know every day for three years I asked myself that same question ? <eos>
 Ever get an answer ? <eos>
 Forget the story find the trunk . Mrs . Thorwald s in it ! <eos>
 Is s Anna who I think it is ? <eos>
 You think he s getting out of here ? <eos>
 Jewelry ? <eos>
 He has his wife s jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there . <eos>
 That was not Mrs . Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning ? <eos>
 Did you ever own a saw ? <eos>
 But I am not a killer ! <eos>
 Jefferies . <eos>
 This s Doyle Jeff . <eos>
 Listen to me ! Lisa s been arrested . <eos>
 Where would they take Lisa ? <eos>
 Precinct Six . I sent a friend over with bail money . <eos>
 Jefferies . <eos>
 Congratulations Jeff . <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 For getting rid of that cast . <eos>
 Wrong day ? <eos>
 You did . <eos>
 Okay . When do I leave ? Half hour ? An hour ? <eos>
 You asked for something dramatically different ! You got it ! <eos>
 Well you know best . Call you later Jeff . <eos>
 Hello . <eos>
 Gunnison ? <eos>
 Yeah . Is that you Jeff ? <eos>
 It s me . <eos>
 Something wrong ? <eos>
 The word s everything . Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday ? <eos>
 Okay . Indo China . Tuesday . We will pick you up . <eos>
 That s more like it . Goodnight old buddy . <eos>
 Hello . <eos>
 Well did you get it Thorwald ? <eos>
 Why should I ? <eos>
 For a little business meeting to settle the estate of your late wife . <eos>
 Can you get me that ring back ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I can not . The police have it by now . <eos>
 Readers Digest April 1939 . <eos>
 I predicted it . <eos>
 Right now I would even welcome trouble . <eos>
 You have got a hormone deficiency . <eos>
 I knew it ! <eos>
 Do not you ever heat that stuff up . <eos>
 Gives your circulation something to fight . What kind of trouble ? <eos>
 She expects me to marry her . <eos>
 That s normal . <eos>
 I do not want to . <eos>
 That s abnormal . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Her father loading up the shotgun ? <eos>
 She s just not the girl for me . <eos>
 There s an intelligent way to approach marriage . <eos>
 How did you know ! <eos>
 Eyes bloodshot . Must have been staring out the window for hours . <eos>
 I was . <eos>
 What will you do if one of them catches you ? <eos>
 Keep your mind off her . <eos>
 She s real eat drink and be merry girl . <eos>
 And she will end up fat alcoholic and miserable . <eos>
 Speaking of misery Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again . Alone . <eos>
 Poor girl . Someday she will find her happiness . <eos>
 Well the salesman could be available soon . <eos>
 Is not he a salesman ? <eos>
 Now what could he sell at three in the morning ? <eos>
 Flashlights . Luminous dials for watches . House numbers that light up . <eos>
 His personal effects . He s probably running away the coward . <eos>
 Sometimes it s worse to stay than it s to run . <eos>
 What about this morning ? Any developments ? <eos>
 No . The shades are still drawn in their apartment . <eos>
 A Federal offense . <eos>
 Goodbye Mr . Jefferies . I will see you tomorrow . <eos>
 Police ? <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 I am just going to get the name of their truck ! <eos>
 You mean the one the dog was sniffing around ? <eos>
 You should not have let her do that ! If he ever <eos>
 Thank heaven that s over ! <eos>
 I wonder . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules . <eos>
 What are you two talking about ? <eos>
 Got a shovel ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 There s probably one in the basement . <eos>
 Smart girl . <eos>
 Smart ? She will be arrested ! <eos>
 What do you need money for ? <eos>
 One hundred and twenty seven . <eos>
 How much do you think you will need ? <eos>
 Ten here . <eos>
 What about the rest ? <eos>
 Hello . <eos>
 Mrs . Doyle ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Jeff again . Has Tom come in yet ? <eos>
 Not yet Jeff . <eos>
 You have not even heard from him ? <eos>
 It s something really important Jeff ? <eos>
 I am afraid it s Tess . <eos>
 Who s Thorwald ? <eos>
 He knows . Do not worry Tess . It s a man . <eos>
 Goodnight you idiot . <eos>
 How s your leg ? <eos>
 Mmmm hurts a little . <eos>
 And your stomach ? <eos>
 Empty as a football . <eos>
 And you love life ? <eos>
 Not too active . <eos>
 Anything else bothering you ? <eos>
 The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice ? <eos>
 A steal at eleven hundred dollars . <eos>
 That dress should be listed on the stock exchange . <eos>
 We sell a dozen a day in this price range . <eos>
 Something big going on somewhere ? <eos>
 Now that s no way to spend your hard earned money ! <eos>
 What would you think of starting off with dinner at the 21 ? <eos>
 Big enough ? <eos>
 Yeah I want to get this thing off and get moving . <eos>
 What a day I have had ! <eos>
 Tell me what was Slim Hayward wearing ? <eos>
 You can not buy that kind of publicity . <eos>
 That s good news . <eos>
 Someday you might want to open up your own studio here . <eos>
 I wish there was one I wanted . <eos>
 Make the one you want . <eos>
 You mean leave the magazine ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Well she picked the most prosperous looking one . <eos>
 She s not in love with him or any of them . <eos>
 How can you tell that from here ? <eos>
 Almost as if it were being written especially for us . <eos>
 Did you ever eat fish heads and rice ? <eos>
 You do not think either one of us could ever change ? <eos>
 Not quite it seems . Goodbye Jeff . <eos>
 You mean goodnight . <eos>
 Ca not we just sort of keep things status quo ? <eos>
 Do not you ever have any problems ? <eos>
 I have one now . <eos>
 So do I . <eos>
 Nothing thank heaven . <eos>
 Why has not he gone into his wife s bedroom all day ? <eos>
 I would not dare answer that . <eos>
 What do you think ? <eos>
 Jeff if you could only see yourself . <eos>
 You would better before you catch the disease ! <eos>
 Maybe she died . <eos>
 Where s the doctor the undertakers ? <eos>
 Lisa please ! <eos>
 It s pretty hard to stay away from that word s not is ? <eos>
 You could see all the things he did could not you ? <eos>
 No comment . <eos>
 What s the apartment house number ? <eos>
 Okay chief . What s my next assignment . <eos>
 To get on home . <eos>
 That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost <eos>
 I wonder where he s going now ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Suppose he does not come back again ? <eos>
 Well I guess it s safe to put on some lights now . <eos>
 All day long I have tried to keep my mind on work . <eos>
 Something on your mind Lisa ? <eos>
 It does not make sense to me . <eos>
 What does not ? <eos>
 Women are not that unpredictable . <eos>
 That Mrs . Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband ? <eos>
 We have all what ? <eos>
 Night . I am going to stay with you . <eos>
 I have the whole weekend off . <eos>
 Say anything else and I will stay tomorrow night too . <eos>
 That s a suitcase ? <eos>
 I will trade you my feminine intuition for a bed for the night . <eos>
 From his landlord once a month . <eos>
 It s utterly beautiful . I wish I could be creative . <eos>
 You are . You have a talent for creating difficult situations . <eos>
 I do ? <eos>
 The same . <eos>
 But he never ends up marrying her . Strange . <eos>
 Weird . Why do not I slip into something comfortable ? <eos>
 You mean like the kitchen ? And make us some coffee ? <eos>
 I hate funny exit lines . <eos>
 Did Mr . Doyle think I stole this case . <eos>
 I will rephrase the question . <eos>
 For a minute Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong . <eos>
 But you are not ? <eos>
 Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see ? <eos>
 Is he cleaning house ? <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 Was not that close ? <eos>

 You do not even know Jacqueline Gibson . <eos>
 I am looking for a party a merry party . <eos>
 Do you think he knows about this ? <eos>
 Could you find him ? <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Let her know what ? <eos>
 She will have to know some time . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 I am Mimi I am dying . <eos>
 I am tired of being afraid of waiting . <eos>
 And then ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Good bye darling . I will only be gone until three . <eos>
 You will be all right ? <eos>
 At least you knew about Dr . Judd . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 It s terribly sweet of you Jason . <eos>
 I have been at the library . <eos>
 I am at sea Jason . <eos>
 Such a simple matter . This figure s the symbol of the Palladists . <eos>
 My window through which I see the world . <eos>
 I have to go <eos>
 It s not that you said have to go . What could compel you <eos>
 Jacqueline s a murderess she killed a man . <eos>
 And Gregory he loves her . <eos>
 He loves you Mary and you will have to tell him . <eos>
 I can not find Gregory . I have been trying to find him . <eos>
 Jason my pet <eos>
 What are you thinking of Bella ? Can I eat dry ? <eos>
 And the other was Judd ? <eos>
 Yes Dr . Louis Judd . <eos>
 Where s Jacqueline Gibson ? <eos>
 What was she to you ? <eos>
 I have lost my knack . <eos>
 Following me to find Jacqueline ? <eos>
 Actually I want to ask two favors of you one as a poet <eos>
 Wait there s that other favor . <eos>
 I would forgotten . <eos>
 Tell me where Jacqueline s we have got to find her . <eos>
 You do not expect me to do that do you ? <eos>
 Yes . When I tell you . <eos>
 I think it s time . <eos>
 A book of successful verse might have changed that eh ? <eos>
 If you like I will go with you to dinner . <eos>
 Dr . Judd ? <eos>
 It s my cloven hoof . It trips me up sometimes . <eos>
 Would they hurt her ? <eos>
 I have not said anything of the sort . <eos>
 But you would like to know where she is ? <eos>
 Is it about Jacqueline ? <eos>
 This s incredible I It must be some sort of a joke . <eos>
 But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister . <eos>
 I am stopping at the Chatsworth . <eos>
 I am afraid not . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 This s Mrs . Redi Mary . <eos>
 I will be out in a minute . <eos>
 Once you would seen my sister you would never forget her . <eos>
 She s not been here for a long time . <eos>
 You mean she just came here rented the room locked it and left ? <eos>
 Your sister have you heard from her lately ? <eos>
 No Mrs . Lowood she does not write often . <eos>
 That makes it all the more difficult <eos>
 Miss Gibson I am tired of resting . <eos>
 Is it fifteen minutes yet ? <eos>
 Why <eos>
 Because I have something very important to do . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I will be right back with Mrs . Wheeler . <eos>
 It s a very real danger and one which forces our decision . <eos>
 I am sorry to be late Natalie . <eos>
 Sorry . I am nervous . This s very trying for me . <eos>
 I know . You introduced Jacqueline to us but how could you tell <eos>
 Ann ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 That was quick . <eos>
 False alarm . <eos>
 Have you ever been on television ? <eos>
 Television ? <eos>

 Excuse me for asking but how would you know ? <eos>
 Hi ! <eos>
 Ann . Hello . <eos>
 Are you in the middle of something ? <eos>
 Nothing I can not finish later . <eos>
 What are these ? <eos>
 Videotapes . <eos>
 It s a personal project I am working on . <eos>
 Who s Donna ? <eos>
 Donna ? <eos>
 Donna . On this tape it says Donna . <eos>
 Donna was a girl I knew in Florida . <eos>
 You went out with her ? <eos>
 Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men . <eos>
 All of these are interviews ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Can we look at one ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 What . what are these interviews about ? <eos>
 The . interviews are about sex Ann . <eos>
 About sex ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What about sex ? <eos>
 Everything about sex . <eos>
 You just ask them questions ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And they just answer them ? <eos>
 Mostly . Sometimes they do things . <eos>
 To you ? <eos>
 No not to me for me for the camera . <eos>
 I do not . why . why do you do this ? <eos>
 I am sorry this came up . <eos>
 This s just . so . <eos>
 Maybe you want to go . <eos>
 John and Cynthia have been . fucking . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 You know ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 How did you know ? <eos>
 She said it on her tape . <eos>
 But even if we had been speaking I would not have told you . <eos>
 Do you think that s such a good idea ? <eos>
 Do not you want to make one ? <eos>
 Yes . But I sense the element of revenge here . <eos>
 What would you know about a normal frame of mind ? <eos>
 That s a good question . <eos>
 What do you have to do to get ready ? <eos>
 Load a new tape turn the camera on . <eos>
 I have money . <eos>
 What will you do when the money runs out ? <eos>
 It wo not . Are you ready ? <eos>
 Tell me your name . <eos>
 Tell me your name . <eos>
 Ann Bishop Millaney . <eos>
 Do you talk to him ? <eos>
 When we are making love ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Sometimes . Afterward . <eos>
 Is he going to see this ? <eos>
 Did you have sex before you were married ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Yes I have . I will . <eos>
 Then as far as this taping goes you have nothing to worry about . <eos>
 I guess not . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 So you do fantasize ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 About who ? <eos>
 I fantasized about you . <eos>
 About me ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 If I asked you to would you ? Not on tape I mean ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 On tape ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Ca not . <eos>
 You said you were not always impotent . <eos>
 That s correct . <eos>
 So you have had sex . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Who was the last person you had sex with ? <eos>
 Her name was Elizabeth . <eos>
 So what happened ? Was it so bad that it turned you off ? <eos>
 No it was wonderful . That was not the problem . <eos>
 So you lied to her ? <eos>
 Yes . I did . Willfully and repeatedly . <eos>
 And now you can ? <eos>
 Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me . <eos>
 Interesting analogy . <eos>
 I am babbling . <eos>
 No you are not . <eos>
 God I am so mad at him ! <eos>
 You are really never going to make love again ? <eos>
 If you were in love with me would you ? <eos>
 I am not in love with you . <eos>
 But if you were ? <eos>
 I . I can not answer that precisely . <eos>
 But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you . <eos>
 I can not . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 I have told you . <eos>
 Who ? Elizabeth ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 You mean you are still in contact with her ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 But you are planning to be ? <eos>
 Not entirely . <eos>
 But that was part of it ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Like maybe a big part ? <eos>
 Do not do that . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 I do not find this turning the tables thing very interesting <eos>
 I want to touch you . <eos>

 Why so you can go after him ? <eos>

 No it s nothing like that . <eos>
 Well what ? Is he dangerous ? <eos>
 No he s not dangerous . Not physically . <eos>
 Well what then ? <eos>

 Are you going to do this or what ? <eos>
 No I am not . <eos>
 I cursed . <eos>
 It was very dark . <eos>

 Morgan be careful . <eos>
 Do you think it s a possibility ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 How can you say that ? <eos>
 Do you feel comforted ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What time s it ? <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>

 Should we turn off the lights ? <eos>
 This s going to do nothing . <eos>
 Did I ever tell you I dislocated Uncle Merrill s arm ? <eos>

 He was only a year and half old . <eos>
 We wo not be able to get out of there . <eos>
 Merrill <eos>

 I do not know whether to look for a midget or a <eos>
 He definitely was not a midget . <eos>
 Okay . So he was tall ? <eos>
 Is anything missing ? <eos>
 It s good advice . Say hi to Marcia for me . <eos>
 There was an accident . Drunk driving . They were not sure . <eos>
 Is he okay ? <eos>
 She s not in an ambulance Father . <eos>
 The truck . the truck has severed most of her lower half . <eos>
 Is that him ? <eos>
 Do not do it ! <eos>
 They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver . <eos>
 It s like War of the Worlds . <eos>
 The book says they are probably very good problem solvers . <eos>
 What book ! <eos>
 Emmett ! Am I glad to see you ! <eos>
 All I did was kiss a girl . <eos>
 . And you had to kill him ? <eos>
 No no no ! I winged him and he dropped his gun . <eos>

 I just came out to say goodbye . <eos>
 Goodbye ? <eos>
 You do not make it easy on a fellow . <eos>
 Maybe you thought you would be back this way someday . <eos>
 Are you all right ? <eos>
 This s a brutal land . <eos>
 You must have known that before you came . <eos>
 Were not you going to come out to say good bye ? <eos>
 I already did that . <eos>
 This time you are really going ? You know where I will be . <eos>
 You are not Baxter ? <eos>

 You know hanging around with you s no picnic . <eos>
 Where you been ? <eos>
 I will see you around . <eos>
 You might make a farmer yet . <eos>
 Believe it . <eos>
 They are drawn to me by that . But it never lasts . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because they do not like what I want . <eos>
 You mean you are not coming with Emmett and me ? <eos>
 I can not say I am convinced you are going anywhere . <eos>
 Yeah that s what happened with me too . <eos>
 The other guy drew first . <eos>

 Target their Bridge . <eos>
 Actually Captain your precise target area was thirty five meters that way . <eos>
 This s its current position . <eos>
 Are any of them inhabited ? <eos>
 Veridian III s uninhabited but Veridian IV supports a pre industrial humanoid society . <eos>
 Population ? <eos>
 Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms . Where are the lifeforms <eos>
 Approximately forty seven minutes sir . <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response . <eos>
 I get it . I get it . <eos>
 The Farpoint mission ? Data that was seven years ago . <eos>
 I know . I just got it . It was very funny . <eos>
 I do not see a control panel or an access port . <eos>
 Data this s not the time . <eos>
 Data are you all right ? <eos>
 I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays . <eos>
 That s it Bridge we are all out ! <eos>
 Sensors show five life signs aboard the station Captain . <eos>
 I am quite . preoccupied with concern about Geordi . <eos>
 We all are Data . But we are going to get him back . <eos>
 We are within visual range of the energy distortion Captain . <eos>
 We are within range sir . <eos>
 Deck 15 section 21 alpha . <eos>

 Did we do it ? Did we make a difference ? <eos>
 Yes . Thank you . <eos>
 I am not going Scotty help me with this chute . <eos>
 You know Scotty it amazes me . <eos>

 Normal s what everyone else s and what you are not . <eos>
 No . <eos>

 Sir ? <eos>
 There s still no indication of why they attacked the station ? <eos>
 You want me to contact Starfleet ? <eos>
 Is there a problem ? <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 Understood . That will be all . <eos>
 Sir s there anything wrong ? <eos>
 That s a pretty big margin of error . <eos>
 Captain are you all right ? <eos>
 Or perhaps they are on the surface . <eos>
 Doctor Soran ? <eos>
 You must think I am quite the madman . <eos>
 What if I told you I found a new truth ? <eos>
 The Nexus . <eos>
 The royal . studs ? <eos>
 It looks like we are too late . <eos>
 These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors . <eos>
 They have found a way to penetrate our shields . <eos>
 Enterprise maintaining full impulse power . <eos>
 And we are gaining . Stand by tractor beam ! <eos>
 Transwarp at your command Sir ! <eos>
 Put me on the hailing frequency . <eos>
 What s going on ? When do we get paid off . <eos>
 Mr . Chekov ? <eos>
 An energy reading from C deck from inside Mr . Spock s quarters . <eos>
 Shall I alert Dr . McCoy ? <eos>
 Excelsior closing to 4000 meters sir . <eos>
 You did great Bones . Just great . <eos>
 Sir Starfleet calling Grissom again . A warning about us . <eos>
 Response ? <eos>
 Admiral there s no response from the Grissom on any channel . <eos>
 Still no response sir . <eos>
 I would swear something was there sir but I might have imagined it . <eos>
 What did you see Chekov ? <eos>
 Nothing on my scanner sir . <eos>
 Sir the shields . Non responsive . <eos>
 Aye sir coding now . <eos>

 Approximately two meters long . Cylindrical in form . <eos>
 New orbit commencing . Coming up on sector three . <eos>
 Check for trace radiation . Infrared enhancement . <eos>
 Saavik to Grissom . Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging . <eos>
 I will handle that later . <eos>
 . . Spock s tube . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Later . Let s go . <eos>
 Saavik . My god what happened to them ? <eos>
 It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack . <eos>
 You mean we are stranded down here ? <eos>
 That may be difficult . <eos>
 Why do not you just call for u help u ! <eos>
 Not exactly . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 It was the only way to solve certain problems <eos>
 So like your father you changed the rules . <eos>
 This planet s aging in surges . <eos>
 Whoever they are they are getting closer . <eos>
 I will go . <eos>
 If equipment s functioning properly indications are an animal life form . <eos>
 Captain this s Saavik . Come in please . <eos>
 None that I can detect sir . <eos>
 Captain what s happening ? <eos>
 Mr . Scott ? <eos>
 I would be grateful Admiral if you would give the word . <eos>

 And if they do not . What will Happen to Spock ? <eos>
 My God . <eos>
 I know you . Do I not ? <eos>
 You would have done the same for me . <eos>
 Why would you do this . <eos>
 Yes yes Spock . <eos>

 The word sir ? <eos>
 The word s no . I am therefore going anyway . <eos>
 Count on our help sir . <eos>
 . We have cleared Spacedoors . <eos>
 Warp Speed Mr . Sulu . <eos>
 Excelsior the great experiment s adrift in space . <eos>
 Estimating Genesis 2 . 9 hours present speed . <eos>
 See ! That shimmering area . <eos>
 That distortion s closing rapidly . Opinion Sulu ? <eos>
 I think it s an energy form sir . <eos>
 Yes . Enough energy to hide a ship would not you say ? <eos>
 . A cloaking device ? <eos>
 Klingon Bird of Prey sir ! She s arming torpedoes . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu what s the crew complement of a Bird of Prey ? <eos>
 About a dozen officers and men . <eos>
 Sir planet core readings unstable . Changing rapidly . <eos>
 What about surface life signs . <eos>
 Close . There <eos>
 If I read this right sir we have full power . <eos>
 We are clear and free to navigate . <eos>
 The planet Vulcan . In hailing distance sir . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu you are on manual . <eos>
 Uhura any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries ? <eos>
 No sir no response . <eos>
 Standby automatic approach system . Advise approach control . <eos>
 Would you look at that ? <eos>
 Gentlemen . Good evening . <eos>
 Good evening Commander . Everything ready ? <eos>
 Welcome aboard Admiral . <eos>
 Where s Doctor McCoy ? <eos>
 But we had requested we were hoping to take her back to Genesis . <eos>
 Genesis ? Whatever for ? <eos>
 Why a natural desire to help finish the work we began ! <eos>
 That s out of the question . No one s going to Genesis ! <eos>
 No Jim ! Enterprise would never stand the pounding . <eos>
 You are right . Thanks for the drink . <eos>
  <eos>
 Wait ! Give me a chance <eos>
 No tricks Kirk . You have one minute . <eos>
 Maltz . Prisoners are at beam coordinates . Standby . <eos>
 You should take the Vulcan too . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 Genesis I want it . <eos>
 Beam the Vulcan up And we talk . <eos>
 Give me what I want and I will consider it . <eos>
 You fool look around you ! This planet s destroying itself ! <eos>
 Yes . Exhilarating s not it ! <eos>
 Give me your hand and we both live . <eos>
  <eos>
 Yes I was . <eos>
 Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan . <eos>
 He would not have spoken of it openly . <eos>
 Then how <eos>
 Kirk I must have your thoughts . May I join your mind ? <eos>
 . He spoke of your friendship . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He asked you not to grieve . <eos>
 . Yes . <eos>
 . The needs of the many outweigh . <eos>
 . The needs of the few . <eos>
 . Or the one . <eos>
 Yes . But how . <eos>
 Bones ! <eos>
 One alive one not . Yet both in pain . <eos>
 What I have done I had to do . <eos>
 But at what cost ? Your ship . Your son . <eos>
 So ! Speak ! <eos>
 Share this with no one . <eos>
 Success my lord . <eos>
 Sir may I suggest <eos>
 I ordered no interruptions . <eos>
 We are cloaked . Enemy closing on impulse power . Range 5000 Kellicams . <eos>
 Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner . <eos>
 How can you tell that ? <eos>
 I will be in my quarters . Execute course to the Federation Boundary . <eos>
 Range 3000 Kellicams . <eos>
 Firing range sir . <eos>
 1000 Kellicams closing ! <eos>
 500 Kellicams ! <eos>
 My Lord enemy commander wishes a truce to confer . <eos>
 You amaze me Commander . <eos>
 All true . <eos>
 The u closet u ? Have you lost all sense of reality ? <eos>
 It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix <eos>
 But as you are so fond of observing Doctor I am not human . <eos>
 You are not going in there ! <eos>
 Physician heal thyself . <eos>
 That s all you have to say ? <eos>

 Romulan Ale ! Bones you know this stuff s illegal <eos>
 I only use it for medicinal purposes . Do not be a pring . <eos>
 Twenty two eighty three . <eos>
 I am almost afraid to . What did you bring me contraband Klingon <eos>

 Amazing ! I do not know what to say <eos>
 Say thank you . <eos>

 And who am I hiding from ? <eos>
 Shore leave Admiral . <eos>
 What about the rest of the inspection Admiral ? <eos>
 Go ? u Where u are we going ? <eos>
 But what if they went nowhere ? <eos>
 How can you think of food at a time like this ? <eos>
 Now that s what I call a meal . <eos>
 Until now . <eos>
 Hours instead of days Saavik now we have minutes instead of hours <eos>
 You okay Jim ? How do you feel ? <eos>
 But Genesis s a civilian project under my control <eos>

 Carol ! <eos>
 Is that a poem ? <eos>
 David <eos>
 Jim <eos>
 Go back . I am going to kill him . <eos>
 Do not tell me you have got something . <eos>
 We have picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner . <eos>
 Are you sure these are the coordinates ? <eos>
 Captain this s the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI <eos>
 You are crazy ! <eos>
 I saw it ! <eos>
 I told you ! I told you I saw a <eos>
 u Botany Bay u oh no ! <eos>
 But the child <eos>
 A criminal Captain a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering <eos>
 Beyond what I told you sir it s classified information . <eos>
 Umm . And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information ? <eos>
 I would think so sir . He s on the Fleet General Staff . <eos>
 Where s Dr . Marcus <eos>
 Why did not you tell me ? <eos>
 It s a long story . <eos>
 It s the Genesis Wave ! <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 He s on a build up to detonation ! <eos>
 How soon <eos>
 We encoded four minutes <eos>
 We will beam aboard and stop it <eos>
 I do not mean to intrude . <eos>
 Uh no . I should be on the bridge . <eos>
 No . I I guess I am not what you expected . <eos>
 I am trying David . <eos>
 So am I . My friends were killed too . <eos>
 I was wrong about you . And u I am u sorry . <eos>
 Let go he can not ! <eos>
 What are you looking at ? <eos>
 The Admiral s son . <eos>
 Do not you believe it . <eos>
 What are u you u looking at ? <eos>
 They are requesting visual communications sir . <eos>
 Let them eat static . <eos>
 Sir our shields are dropping ! <eos>
 They wo not <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 Departing dark side Regula . <eos>
 We will lose them if they go in there . <eos>
 No sir ! We have Genesis Whatever you want <eos>
 Tactical ! <eos>
 Inoperative . <eos>
 Yours . is . the superior . <eos>
 Genesis what s that ? <eos>
 Do not play with me Kirk my hand s on the phaser control <eos>
 Give me some time to recall the data on our computers <eos>
 Time s up Admiral . <eos>
 Captain . We are waiting . What s the delay ? <eos>
 All s well sir . You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 We will be going to warp speed <eos>
 Scotty what s left ? <eos>
 Just the batteries sir . I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes <eos>
 We do not have minutes . Can you give me phaser power ? <eos>
 Just barely sir . <eos>
 I will need ten minutes sir til the radiation dissipates . <eos>
 Uhura . Ca not you augment ? <eos>
 She s not responding . <eos>
 Try the emergency channels . <eos>
 Enterprise to Reliant . Come in Reliant . <eos>
 Mr . Scott on discrete . <eos>
 On screen . <eos>
 Admiral <eos>
 . No response sir . <eos>
 Saavik for God s sake tell her we are all right . <eos>
 Mr . Scott you old space dog . You are well ? <eos>
 I had me a wee bout but Dr . McCoy pulled me through . <eos>
 Midshipman you are a tiger . <eos>
 Give the word Admiral . <eos>
 Mr . Scott the word s given . <eos>
 No sir ! You will flood the whole compartment . <eos>
 If he had not we would be space by now . <eos>
 Yes Spock . <eos>
 Meaning you can not even beam us back ? <eos>
 And who s this ? <eos>
 Your first training voyage Mr . Preston ? <eos>
 Yes SIR . <eos>
 Is the word given ? <eos>
 The word s given warp speed . <eos>
 It had the virtue of never having been tried . <eos>
 Hrummm . and where are you off to now ? <eos>
 The Enterprise . I must check in before your inspection . And you ? <eos>
 There s a first time for everything Admiral . <eos>
 How far ? <eos>
 Carol Marcus <eos>
 It literally s Genesis . <eos>
 The power of creation <eos>
 What s she doing here ? <eos>
 Is it possible their COMM system has failed ? <eos>
 One thing s certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power . <eos>
 Visual ! Mr . Sulu divert everything to the phasers <eos>
 Not enough against their shields . <eos>
 The prefix code ? <eos>
 And no way of knowing if Reliant s still in the area . <eos>
 Reliant could be hiding behind that rock . <eos>
 A distinct possibility . <eos>
 All right join the party . Mr . Spock the ship s yours . <eos>
 What IS working around here ? <eos>
 Not much Admiral . We have partial main power . <eos>
 That s it ? <eos>
 Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes . Reliant s closing . <eos>
 Admiral they are reducing speed . <eos>
 Spock ! <eos>
 The ship out of danger ? <eos>
 . the good of the few . <eos>
 In my quarters Uhura . <eos>
 Uhura ! What s happening ? Damn it . <eos>
 Transmission jammed at the source sir . <eos>
 Any suggestions Admiral ? <eos>
 Well Mr . Saavik are you going to stay with the sinking ship ? <eos>
 Permission to speak candidly sir ? <eos>
 Very well . <eos>
 I do not believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities . <eos>
 And why not ? <eos>
 As I indicated Admiral that thought had not occurred to me . <eos>
 Lieutenant are you wearing your hair differently ? <eos>
 May I speak sir ? <eos>
 Lieutenant self expression does not seem to be one of your problems . <eos>
 I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating . <eos>
 You earned it . <eos>
 I did not think so . <eos>
 You are bothered by your performance on the u Kobayashi Maru u . <eos>
 I failed to resolve the situation . <eos>
 There s no correct resolution . It s a test of character . <eos>
 May I ask how u you u dealt with the test ? <eos>
 That was a little joke . <eos>
 Humor . that s a difficult concept . it s not logical . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 This s damned peculiar . Yellow alert . <eos>
 Khan ! <eos>
 Reliant s command . <eos>
 Indeterminate life signs . <eos>
 That s true Admiral . All the memory cells have been emptied . <eos>
 What s on your mind Lieutenant ? <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship . <eos>
 Regulation 46 A If transmissions are being monitored during battle . <eos>
 That was close <eos>
 Hold your course . Look sharp . <eos>
 Mr . Saavik all stop . <eos>
 All stop sir . <eos>
 Cease fire . Look sharp . <eos>
 Power levels quite low sir . <eos>
 Saavik get us out best speed ! <eos>
 Time from my mark . <eos>
 Two minutes ten seconds . <eos>
 Time ! <eos>
 Three minutes thirty seconds . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 I will be in my quarters if needed but I would prefer . <eos>
 Understood sir . <eos>
 Admiral on the bridge ! <eos>
 As you were Mr . Saavik . <eos>
 Aye sir . On course to Ceti Alpha . All s well . <eos>
 Yes well why do not you show him around and . <eos>
 Stop engines . <eos>
 Course plotted for Regula I Admiral . <eos>
 Reliant in our section this quadrant sir and slowing <eos>
 Mr . Sulu . The shields ! <eos>
 I can not get power sir ! <eos>
 Mr . Sulu lock phasers on target and await my command . <eos>
 Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I . <eos>
 Admiral on the bridge <eos>
 Phaser lock inoperative sir . <eos>
 Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen . <eos>
 Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone . <eos>
 May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone <eos>
 I am aware of my responsibilities Mister . <eos>
 Shields activated ! <eos>
 Aft thrusters Mr . Sulu . <eos>
 We are clear and free to navigate . <eos>
 Prepare for warp speed . <eos>
 Fire all phasers . <eos>
 He s not what I expected Sir . <eos>
 What did you expect Lieutenant ? <eos>
 Very well Mr . Saavik clear all moorings . <eos>
 All moorings are clear Captain . <eos>
 Lieutenant how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock ? <eos>
 Take her out Mr . Saavik . <eos>
 Lieutenant the Admiral s aware of the Regulations . <eos>
 Certainly . <eos>
 You lied . <eos>
 I do not understand the final question . <eos>
 You are half human . The Computer knows that . <eos>
 Where must you go ? <eos>
 To Earth . To offer testimony . <eos>
 You do this for friendship ? <eos>
 Humans make illogical decisions . <eos>
 Heard there was some excitement . <eos>
 How are you doing ? <eos>
 You sent them away . Without even letting me say goodbye ? <eos>
 Back home we call him the miracle worker . <eos>
 He never jokes . Perhaps the professor could use your computer . <eos>
 No ! No . What did you have in mind . <eos>
 You sure this s such a bright idea ? <eos>
 It will come back to him . <eos>
 Are you sure ? That s what I thought . <eos>
 Bones <eos>
 Bones stay here . <eos>
 You are really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket ? <eos>
 That s the general idea . <eos>
 That s crazy ! <eos>
 What did you say she was getting ? <eos>
 An experimental device doctor . <eos>
 Wake up man wake up ! <eos>
 He s coming round Jim . <eos>
 Congratulations Jim . I think you have saved the Earth . <eos>
 Hi . Busy ? <eos>
 You are joking . <eos>
 A joke s a story with a humorous climax . <eos>
 You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death ? <eos>
 You just said there are not any except on Earth of the past . <eos>
 That s what I said Doctor . <eos>
 Angels and ministers of grace defend us . <eos>
 Naturally . So what s your problem ? <eos>
 Acceleration s no longer a constant . <eos>
 Well you are gonna have to take your best shot . <eos>
 . Best shot . <eos>
 Guess Spock . Your best guess . <eos>
 Guessing s not in my nature . <eos>
 You are saying . It s a compliment . <eos>
 Who are you ? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me . <eos>
 We are just observing . <eos>
 What the hell do you think you are doing ? <eos>
 What s your degree in dentistry ? <eos>
 How do you explain slowing pulse low respiratory rate and coma ? <eos>
 Fundoscopic examination <eos>
 Fundoscopic examination s unrevealing in these cases ! <eos>
 What s causing that ! <eos>
 Captain their call s being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power ! <eos>
 Can you isolate the wave ? <eos>
 Find it ? <eos>
 Team leader this s team 2 . Come in please . <eos>
 I have the coordinates of the reactor . <eos>
 How long ? <eos>
 All right Commander you wanna tell us anything ? <eos>
 All right . Let s take it from the top . <eos>
 The top of what ? <eos>
 Name ? <eos>
 My name ? <eos>
 No u my u name . <eos>
 I do not know your name . <eos>
 You play games with me and you are through <eos>
 Go ahead . Stun me . <eos>
 No sir . And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations . <eos>
 Shields Mr . Chekov . <eos>
 Shields aye . <eos>
 No choice now Scotty ! <eos>
 Ah well done team 2 . <eos>
 And Admiral it s the Enterprise . <eos>
 Cloaking device s stable . All systems normal . <eos>
 The mains are down sir ! Aux power s not responding . <eos>
 Can you protect us ? <eos>
 Attempting the hell to communicate . <eos>
 I suppose they told you that . <eos>
 So you were at Berkeley . <eos>
 You sure you wo not change your mind ? <eos>
 There s really very little point in my trying to explain . <eos>
 We do not want to be any trouble . <eos>
 Memory problems too . <eos>
 Uh huh . What about you ? Where you from ? <eos>
 Can I ask u you u something ? <eos>
 Go ahead . <eos>
 They are gonna hafta take their chances . <eos>
 No ma am . No dipshit . <eos>
 Or believe I will bet . <eos>
 Just a little joke . See you later old friend . <eos>
 He s just going to hang around the bushes while we eat ? <eos>
 Do you trust me ? <eos>
 Just lucky I guess . <eos>
 You are upset about losing the whales . <eos>
 . You are very perceptive . <eos>
 How will that be done exactly ? <eos>
 They will be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there . <eos>
 Where could you take them ? <eos>
 Hm ? <eos>
 My whales ? Where could you take them where they would be safe ? <eos>
 It s not so much a matter of a place as of time . <eos>
 Sorry the time would have to be right now . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 What s what ? <eos>
 Wanna try it from the top ? <eos>
 Tell me when the whales are going to be released ? <eos>
 . Who are you ? <eos>
 Do not tell me you are from outer space . <eos>
 All right . The truth ? <eos>
 Well why did not you say so ? Why all the coy disguises ? <eos>
 It would not be my first choice no . <eos>
 Here . In the park ? <eos>
 Steady now . We need your help . <eos>
 Have I flipped out ? . Is any of this real ? <eos>
 It s all real . Look . The storage tanks for the whales . <eos>
 Kirk . They are gone . <eos>
 What kind of spaceship s this anyway ? <eos>
 If we keep going up they will catch us ! <eos>
 Gillian . Would the whales be at sea by now ? <eos>
 Yes . If you have a chart on board I can show you . <eos>
 All I need s the radio frequency to track them . <eos>
 What are you talking about ? I am coming with you . <eos>
 You can not . Our next stop s the 23rd Century . <eos>
 All right . The frequency s 401 megahertz . <eos>
 You tricked me . <eos>
 Oh my God we are too late ! <eos>
 You mean this s goodbye ? <eos>
 Permission to come aboard . <eos>
 Permission granted . <eos>
 Thank you Admiral . <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>
 Spock . <eos>
 As suspected the Probe s transmissions are the songs sung by whales . <eos>
 Spock could the Humpback s answer to this call be simulated ? <eos>
 The sounds but not the language . We would be responding in gibberish . <eos>
 Is there any other planet where this species exists ? <eos>
 That would be futile Admiral . The probe would neutralize us easily . <eos>
 Mr . Spock your computations ? <eos>
 In progress Admiral . <eos>
 Ready to engage computer Admiral . <eos>
 What s our target in time ? <eos>
 The late 20th Century . <eos>
 You have programmed that from memory . <eos>
 There s a 20th Century possibility . <eos>
 Where would we find these reactors . Theoretically . <eos>
 How do you know this . <eos>
 As you observed a primitive Culture . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Oh the complete works of Jacqueline Susan the novels of Harold Robbins . <eos>
 Spock . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Well for one thing you have not quite got the hang of it . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 And another thing . It s not always necessary to tell the truth . <eos>
 I cannot tell a lie . <eos>
 You do not have to lie . You could exaggerate . <eos>
 Exaggerate . <eos>
 You have done it before . Ca not you remember ? <eos>
 The hell I can not <eos>
 I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions . <eos>
 Status ? <eos>
 The tank will be finished by morning . <eos>
 That s cutting it closer than you know . What about team two ? <eos>
 Admiral . Full power s restored . <eos>
 Is that the logical thing to do Spock . <eos>
 No Admiral . But s the human thing to do . <eos>
 Mr . Spock where the hell s the power you promised me ? <eos>
 Spock . Did braking thrusters fire ? <eos>
 They did Admiral . <eos>
 Spock Condition report ! <eos>
 Guidance s functional . Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank . <eos>

 Mr . Sulu we need breakaway speed ! <eos>
 Hang on sir . Nine point seven . point eight . Breakaway threshold . <eos>
 Mr . Sulu . . Mr . Sulu ? <eos>
 . Aye sir . <eos>
 What s our condition ? <eos>
 Sir . Braking thrusters seem to have fired . <eos>

 Sir I have got some back pressure on manual <eos>
 Let s see what she s got Mr . Sulu . <eos>
 Systems report . Communications ? <eos>
 Communications Systems ready . Communications Officer ready as she will ever be . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Overlapping distress calls . Some from Starships . others . <eos>
 Then this s what it would sound like underwater ? <eos>
 Admiral I am receiving whale songs . <eos>
 We will stick together till we get orientated . Bearing to the whales ? <eos>
 283 degrees . 15 . 2 kilometers . <eos>
 Any luck . <eos>
 I have found Chekov sir he s in emergency surgery right now . <eos>
 Uhura ! Where ! <eos>
 Bearing ! <eos>
 Bearing 327 range 600 nautical . <eos>
 Admiral I have a signal closing on the whales . Bearing 328 degrees . <eos>
 Estimate range ship to whales ! <eos>
 Unidentified aircraft 40000 feet MSL range 30 miles bearing 010 . <eos>
 I can not sir Nothing ! <eos>
 Scotty how long s this bay ? <eos>
 About 60 feet Admiral . <eos>
 That should be enough . Can you enclose it to hold water ? <eos>
 Scotty we have to find some Humpbacks . <eos>
 Humpbacked people . <eos>
 Whales Scotty . 45 to 50 feet long about 40 tons a piece . <eos>
 Admiral how am I going to handle all that weight ? <eos>
 You will work it out Scotty . And remember two of them . <eos>
 Two ? <eos>
 They are giving out . De crystallizing . <eos>
 It s going slow sir . It will be well into tomorrow . <eos>
 I am ready Spock . Let s go find George and Gracie . <eos>
 Scotty Are the whale tanks secure ? <eos>
 Stay with me sir I need more power curve . <eos>
 How long Scotty ? <eos>
 Stand by sir . Miracle worker at work . <eos>
 Mr . Scott do not make jokes we are in danger of <eos>
 Full power sir . <eos>
 The whales . ! <eos>
 No power to the bay doors . <eos>
 The explosive override ? <eos>
 It s under water ! There s no way to reach it . <eos>
 Go on ahead . Close the hatch ! <eos>
 I am well Admiral . <eos>
 We deny nothing ! We have the right to preserve our race ! <eos>
 Professor Scott if you will <eos>
 With pleasure . <eos>
 Well that s different . <eos>
 If you will follow me Professor <eos>
 I will . Can my assistant come too ? <eos>
 Doctor Nichols I might have something to offer u you u . <eos>
 . Yes ? <eos>
 I notice you are still working with polymers . <eos>
 Hello ? Computer . <eos>
 Just use the keyboard . <eos>
 Transparent aluminum ? <eos>
 Hi . <eos>
 Hi . Huey 205 s not it ? <eos>
 Right on . You fly ? <eos>
 Oh here and there . I flew something similar in my Academy days . <eos>
 They are my friends . <eos>
 Yes of course . Do you have any message for your mother ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I do not like to leave questions unanswered . <eos>
 But not you . <eos>
 There are days . <eos>
 You do not live up to your reputation as an offlander Picard . <eos>
 . an offlander ? <eos>
 What s the rush ? <eos>
 There s a cavern at the base of the next hill . <eos>
 Mother and son . You arranged this . <eos>
 You are what ? <eos>
 My father told me I should not talk to you . <eos>
 I understand . <eos>
 Do not you ever get tired ? <eos>
 My power cells continually re charge themselves . <eos>
 Really ? <eos>
 Really . <eos>
 Do machines ever play ? <eos>
 I play the violin . and my chess routines are quite advanced . <eos>
 Chase me ! <eos>
 Data . have not you ever just played . for fun ? <eos>
 Androids . do not have . fun . <eos>
 Why not . <eos>
 Anij ! <eos>
 Tournel will take you the rest of the way . <eos>
 No . I want to stay with you . <eos>
 I have to go home now . <eos>
 Can he breathe under water ? <eos>
 Data does not breathe . <eos>
 Wo not he rust ? <eos>
 The artificial lifeform was right ? <eos>
 Very funny . <eos>
 Prepare to transport the hostages to the ship . <eos>
 Will he live ? <eos>
 She s stabilizing . <eos>
 Is it safe to move her ? <eos>
 Hello Data . <eos>
 Captain Geordi . <eos>
 Yes . that looks like them . <eos>
 What s the last thing you remember Data . <eos>
 his nose should pant and his lip should curl . <eos>
 Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills . <eos>
 A ship <eos>
 It s clearly Federation in origin Captain . <eos>
 Captain I have activated transport inhibitors around the village . <eos>
 How many ? <eos>
 I am showing fresh air behind this calcite formation Captain . <eos>
 Will the structure hold if we blast through ? <eos>
 I will order Riker to turn around . <eos>
 We are taking this ship out of here . this mission s over . <eos>
 It s not over . <eos>
 You have no idea what precipitated his behavior ? <eos>
 . And now he s holding our people hostage down there . <eos>
 Captain I was not expecting you . <eos>
 Understood . <eos>
 You are not finished here ? <eos>
 You are looking well Jean Luc . Rested . <eos>
 I am acting on orders form the Federation Council . <eos>
 I wonder . which one of us will be facing that court martial . <eos>
 Do you know how to disable the injector ? <eos>
 But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge . <eos>
 May I talk to you alone ? <eos>
 The shields in that section wo not protect them against the thermolytic reaction . <eos>
 They . are in opposite directions sir . <eos>
 We are about to lose communications with Starfleet Captain . <eos>
 The Son a reports claim they did not fire until after he malfunctioned . <eos>
 I do not believe it happened that way . <eos>
 Fail safe ? <eos>
 His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions . <eos>
 Implants bothering you ? <eos>
 Full impulse . <eos>
 Will that stop the tear ? <eos>
 You got me Commander . <eos>
 We are pulling it like a zipper across space . <eos>
 Options ? <eos>
 I would not be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver . <eos>
 I do not think they believe us . <eos>
 Sir they have detonated an isolytic burst . a subspace tear s forming . <eos>
 The tear s closing on us . impact in fifteen seconds . <eos>
 Commander if one of their weapons hits that gas . <eos>
 Commander I am showing two Son a ships on an intercept course . <eos>
 How long til they reach us ? <eos>
 I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord . <eos>
 We are still thirty six minutes from transmission range sir . <eos>
 They are powering their forward weapons array . <eos>
 Yew cheen chef faw . <eos>
 Who s it ? <eos>
 Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey . <eos>
 Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we have not left yet . <eos>
 Deck five . <eos>
 Prepare the ship for departure at oh seven hundred hours . <eos>
 You must be planning on doing some hunting . <eos>
 My name s Sojef Captain . <eos>
 Jean Luc Picard . my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi . <eos>
 Would you like something to eat ? <eos>
 I wish there was a way to bring them back home . <eos>
 Ask them . <eos>
 Bridge to Captain Picard . We are approaching sector four four one . <eos>
 Worf to Picard . <eos>
 Yes . yes I . can hear you . <eos>
 Captain . <eos>
 Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface . <eos>
 Transmit a wide band co variant signal . That will get his attention . <eos>
 Come out come out wherever you are . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Direct hit . He s resetting his shield harmonics . <eos>
 Scanners are off line ! <eos>
 The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire ! <eos>
 Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings ? <eos>
 No sir . <eos>
 Debrief them again . Have you been in a fight Commander ? <eos>
 No sir . It s a gorch . <eos>
 Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned . <eos>
 Should I distribute phasers to the Ba ku sir . <eos>
 You need a haircut Commander . <eos>
 Isolinear tags . Their transporters can lock onto them . <eos>
 All injector sub systems are confirmed off line . <eos>
 One . It s Ru afo . <eos>
 Can you beam him off ? <eos>
 Negative . He s established a security field around the control room . <eos>
 . Population three hundred million . <eos>
 Say the greeting again . <eos>
 What are they interested in . <eos>
 Wine women and song . <eos>
 Nomadic collectors of precious metals jewels . <eos>
 Why would we be involved with these people ? <eos>
 You have not done that in a long time . <eos>
 What . <eos>
 What you are doing to my neck . <eos>
 No children ? <eos>
 This s not one of the usual therapeutic postures . <eos>
 But it s comfortable . <eos>
 Why do not you try sitting up ? <eos>
 Or you could try lying down . <eos>
 Both . I think I am having a mid life crisis . <eos>
 . I believe you . <eos>
 . I am not sleeping well . <eos>
 Augh . <eos>
 Augh ? <eos>
 All hands . Battle stations ! <eos>
 Initiate launch sequence . <eos>
 Exactly as the simulations predicted . <eos>
 Sir I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels . <eos>
 Your scanners must be malfunctioning . <eos>
 They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here . <eos>
 Absolutely . <eos>
 Good hunting . Hayes out . <eos>
 We are fine sir . It will take some . time to explain . <eos>
 Montana . Energize . <eos>
 Cochrane . the inventor of warp drive ? <eos>
 You actually performed surgery . <eos>
 Not yet . <eos>
 How long has he been unconscious ? <eos>
 You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg . <eos>
 You have taken your first step toward perfection . How does it feel ? <eos>
 I do not know what you are referring to . <eos>
 I wish to . go back to the way I was . <eos>
 My creator did not intend for me to experience these things . <eos>
 Is not it better like this . <eos>
 Yes . but the Enterprise . my duty . <eos>
 There s a perimeter alert . A ship has entered sensor range . <eos>
 Vulcan ? <eos>
 Can you configure it ? <eos>
 I believe so . <eos>
 Dispersive armor s holding . <eos>

 It was not a trick . I used to be an electrical engineer . <eos>
 You seem to have an answer for everything . <eos>
 Something wrong with that ? <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 The invasion plans . <eos>
 There s no invasion . <eos>
 Take care of him . He s a very special man . <eos>
 Ah . yes . but I did not realize that <eos>
 Money . So you can get dome money . <eos>

 Friends from Cornell . <eos>
 Some . <eos>
 We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon . <eos>
 You are leaving are not you ? <eos>

 We are still in Earth orbit . <eos>
 Looks like they damaged the silo . <eos>
 Life signs ? <eos>
 Good luck sir . <eos>
 Return to our own time ? <eos>
 Yes sir . But Captain . are we . all going back ? <eos>
 Unless you would like to stay . <eos>
 A ship wide decompression has been initiated ! <eos>
 What the hell s happening Worf ? <eos>
 What are they doing ? <eos>
 They are re routing the deflector power conduits . <eos>
 They are connecting the conduits to subspace communications . <eos>
 We have to stop them from sending that message . <eos>
 Agreed . Options ? <eos>
 I guess I would better get it right the first time . <eos>
 Are you alright ? <eos>
 Worf ! I am going to need at least five minutes ! <eos>
 Report ! <eos>
 We have lost Bridge control ! <eos>
 Emergency override ! <eos>
 They are bypassing Engineering . <eos>
 I remember it made me sick . <eos>
 I have to admit there was a moment there when <eos>
 Worf to Bridge . <eos>
 Worf to Bridge . We are about to enter the Environmental Control Room . <eos>
 Worf ? Is something wrong ? <eos>
 What the hell happened down there Worf ? <eos>
 Captain they are firing at a nuclear missile silo . in central Montana . <eos>
 Mr . President . <eos>
 Admiral Donald . Bill . <eos>
 Good luck Captain . <eos>
 I believe the operation s over . <eos>
 I am going to perform surgery on a torpedo you never know . <eos>
 You may need assistance doctor . <eos>
 Bet you wish you would stood in bed . <eos>
 Spock that was actually funny . <eos>
 Calm yourself doctor the operation s almost complete . <eos>
 Or not to be <eos>
 Uh Jim . <eos>
 What the Hell s going on ? <eos>
 Sweet Jesus . He s lost a lot of whatever this stuff is . <eos>
 Can you ? <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 Figures . <eos>
 Three months till retirement . What a way to finish . <eos>
 We are not finished . <eos>
 U Kobayashi Maru U . <eos>
 Bones are you afraid of the future ? <eos>
 That was the general idea I intended to convey . <eos>
 I did not mean this future . <eos>
 What s it with you anyway ? <eos>
 Still think we are finished ? <eos>
 What kind of creature s this ? Last night you two were spooning <eos>
 Jim leave me I am finished . <eos>
 If they are even looking for us . <eos>
 Damned clever if you ask me . <eos>
 ABSOLUTELY NOT ! <eos>
 And the good news s they are not going to prosecute . <eos>
 Perhaps with a few small steps at a time . Like this one . <eos>
 This s fun . <eos>
 Too bad we can not SMELL her . <eos>
 Are you carrying a surgeon ? <eos>
 We were until your torpedoes ! <eos>
 Doctor McCoy what s your current medical status ? <eos>
 Stand . <eos>
 Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him ? <eos>
 Barely . <eos>
 They will make it look like an accident . <eos>
 They will respect him now . <eos>
 I have always wanted to meet you Captain . <eos>
 Would you care to go topside ? <eos>
 My God what happened here ? <eos>
 You feign ignorance ? <eos>
 He s a DOCTOR ! <eos>
 He just tried to save him ! <eos>
 I checked the data banks yes . <eos>
 And what did they tell you ? <eos>
 Are those your words ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Spoken by you ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Louder please . We cannot hear you . <eos>
 You were demoted . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 For insubordination . <eos>
 You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One ? <eos>
 Well I <eos>
 You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor ? <eos>
 Where s Mr . Sulu ? <eos>
 Captain you are not going to show them the bridge ? <eos>
 Just the size of my head <eos>
 Torpedo room ? <eos>
 Captain if they fire at us with our shields down <eos>
 From Starfleet ? <eos>
 Where IS the conference ? <eos>
 She s here somewhere . <eos>
 Shields . Battle stations . <eos>
 Mr . Chekov take us forward thrusters only one half impulse power . <eos>
 Course heading Captain ? <eos>
 They are preparing to fire . <eos>
 What ARE we searching for Mr . Spock ? <eos>
 This s the first evidence that corroborates our theory . <eos>
 Now we go to Starfleet ? <eos>
 Now we expand our search to include uniforms . <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Captain I am getting a message from Klingon High Command . <eos>
 An INCIDENT ? <eos>
 Do we report this sir ? <eos>
 We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation . <eos>
 We will make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours . <eos>
 Thank you Captain Kirk . The evening has been most . edifying . <eos>
 I have heard of chameloids Shapeshifters I thought you were mythical . <eos>
 Your friends are late . <eos>
 Is not it about time you became something else ? <eos>
 What took you so long ? <eos>
 Kill him ! He s the one ! <eos>
 He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens . <eos>
 He s got it . <eos>
 And your coat . <eos>
 Fraid not . It would not fit him anyway . <eos>
 How did you know . <eos>
 We do not get many presidential assassins . <eos>
 How much time s left of your sentence ? <eos>
 Listen . No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe . <eos>
 Except us . <eos>
 I know how to get outside the shield . <eos>
 Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed . <eos>
 Stand down your weapons . <eos>
 Captain if <eos>
 Stand DOWN Mr . Scott . All stop . That s an order . <eos>
 This s incredible <eos>
 Aft thrusters <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Plot a course for Kronos Lieutenant . <eos>
 Kronos sir ? <eos>
 I am still in the chair Lieutenant . <eos>
 Sorry <eos>
 Come on Saavik you COULD knock <eos>
 We are almost at the rendezvous I thought you would want to know . <eos>
 You piloted well out of spacedock Lieutenant <eos>
 I always wanted to try that . <eos>
 Uhura hailing frequencies . Right standard rudder bring us alongside . <eos>
 I hope you are happy . <eos>
 Saavik you know anything about a neutron energy surge ? <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Captain our shields ! <eos>
 Who s US ? <eos>
 Just the prototype . <eos>
 This s Captain Sulu USS Excelsior . <eos>
 Sulu ! <eos>
 Standing by Captain Kirk . <eos>
 You understand that by even talking to us you are violating regulations Captain . <eos>
 When does this conference start ? <eos>
 According to my information today . <eos>
 Thank you Captain Sulu . <eos>
 I have personally vouched for you in this matter Captain . <eos>
 WE volunteered ? <eos>
 There s an old Vulcan proverb only Nixon could go to China . <eos>
 How could you vouch for me ? That s . . arrogant presumption <eos>
 Jim there s an historic opportunity here <eos>
 DON T TRUST THEM . DON T BELIEVE THEM <eos>
 They are dying . <eos>
 Never been this close . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 I am uncertain . <eos>
 Spock I am really tired . <eos>
 We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Curiously it appears to emanate from us . <eos>
 What the <eos>
 We HAVEN T fired <eos>
 Captain . <eos>
 The peace conference . <eos>
 Why would they give them to us ? <eos>
 I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements . <eos>
 But I am not human . I am only <eos>
 Close enough to beam down ? <eos>
 The only way to find out if a man s trustworthy . <eos>
 Control tower reading Sir . <eos>
 Channel open Captain . <eos>
 Captain <eos>
 WE SURRENDER . <eos>
 Gorkon s own man ? <eos>
 Uhura ? <eos>
 You must have faith . <eos>
 Faith . <eos>
 Her own father . <eos>
 Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch Lieutenant . <eos>
 A lie ? <eos>
 A lie ? <eos>
 If you are logical . <eos>
 I do not want to . <eos>
 Direct hit <eos>
 Trouble ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Apparently they are refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock sir . <eos>
 Signal Starfleet that . we have no idea location of Enterprise . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 You having hearing problems mister ? <eos>
 I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port <eos>
 I have confirmed the location sir but . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Praxis ? <eos>
 NO WAY ! <eos>
 It s as I said Mr . Spock Inventory still registers every torpedo . <eos>
 Yet the data banks insist we fired twice . One computer s lying . <eos>
 A computer canna lie sir . <eos>
 I think not . <eos>
 You can check the torpedoes visually if you like <eos>
 We will have to check every one of them Mr . Scott . <eos>
 That could take hours ! <eos>
 Nevertheless . <eos>
 And if they are still in place ? <eos>
 They dinna fire on themselves . And there were no other ships present . <eos>
 There was an enormous neutron energy surge . <eos>
 Too far off . Very near us . Perhaps . underneath us . <eos>
 If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would have seen her ! <eos>
 A Bird of Prey canna fire when she s cloaked ! <eos>
 They are outside the beaming shield . Mr . Scott start your engines . <eos>
 Sulu s giving us his position and telling us he s standing by . <eos>
 I do not think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament . <eos>
 They might as well arrest me too I felt like Lieutenant Saavik . <eos>
 Fuzzy face s gone . <eos>
 Do you know who I am ? <eos>
 You are me . <eos>
 Do you know where you are ? <eos>
 Can you remember our father ? <eos>
 Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Brother . I cannot move . <eos>
 No I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because you are dangerous . <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 Do you know anything about Shinzon s plans against the Federation ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship ? <eos>
 No . Can I move now ? <eos>
 No . I must deactivate you . <eos>
 For how long ? <eos>
 Indefinitely . <eos>
 Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath s not it ? <eos>
 Beverly come in . <eos>
 Remember him ? <eos>
 Is he very much like you were ? <eos>
 Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels you are completely normal . <eos>
 That was another time . <eos>
 Not tonight I have work here . <eos>
 So . To happy endings . <eos>
 Now you make a toast . <eos>
 To new worlds . <eos>
 The closest signature s two kilometers to the west . that direction sir . <eos>
 The final signature s approx imately 300 meters up that incline . <eos>
 He s very observant . <eos>
 Data ! <eos>
 A bit less florid Data . <eos>
 A weapon . <eos>
 It will only work for one of us . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 We will find a way off together . Recommendations ? <eos>
 What do you imagine this is ? <eos>
 Ready Captain . <eos>
 Of you ? <eos>
 It s interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography ? <eos>
 Yes sir . The Rift effects all long range communications . <eos>
 We are losing dorsal shields . <eos>
 Captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine . <eos>
 We are being hailed . <eos>
 Sir allow me to go . You are needed here . <eos>
 Negative . <eos>
 Why am I looking at me ? <eos>
 You are not looking at your self . You are looking at me . <eos>
 You have a red shirt . <eos>
 This s not an appropriate time for a conversation . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle . <eos>
 How many of you did Dr . Soong make ? <eos>
 An individual more like you you mean . <eos>
 What s our approximate distance ? <eos>
 It appears to be . . an arm . <eos>
 Why s it moving ? <eos>
 It s you . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 If you would not mind . <eos>
 May I have this dance ? <eos>
 Counselor . <eos>
 Do you have a moment sir ? <eos>
 I am going to miss you . <eos>
 Is he sincere about wanting peace ? <eos>
 How can you be certain ? <eos>
 Captain I might have a way to find them . <eos>
 Counselor ? <eos>
 The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle me . <eos>
 But how can he ? He will kill you . <eos>
 Imzadi . This s so good . <eos>
 I will always be with you now . Now and forever . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I am afraid that drink will have to wait Captain . <eos>
 Do you have life support ? <eos>
  <eos>
 What do we know about the planet ? <eos>
 Uncharted . We will have to get closer for a more detailed scan . <eos>
 What s he doing ? <eos>
 He thinks he knows exactly what I am going to do . <eos>
 Sir ? <eos>
 Aye sir . <eos>
 Deanna on my mark . <eos>
 How long until he can fire ? <eos>
 Sir we are being hailed . <eos>
 I will take care of it sir . <eos>
 Admiral Janeway . Good to see you . <eos>
  <eos>
 New Praetor ? <eos>
 Understood . <eos>
  <eos>
 Not with the Romulans . <eos>
  <eos>
 Just lucky Admiral . <eos>
 Enterprise . We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar . <eos>
 So human . you have met your better self ! <eos>
 I wo not do it . <eos>
 I am picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system . <eos>
 To find the head sir ? <eos>
 Sir I recommend we raise shields . <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Captain ! <eos>
 We are being hailed . <eos>
 Sir we have had an unauthorized access into the main computer . <eos>
 Sir we are being hailed . <eos>
 Captain the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock . <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 Captain you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command . <eos>
 We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators . <eos>
 It s working . <eos>
 She s not out for a pleasure cruise . <eos>
 Not very chatty . <eos>
 He was not designed to live a complete human life span . <eos>
 Oh boy . Destroy humanity and the Federation s crippled . <eos>
 Strength in numbers ? <eos>
 Report . <eos>
 Serving with you has been an honor . <eos>
 And you are not as we imagined you . <eos>
 Praetor ? <eos>
 And the Senate supports you ? <eos>
 Right now you re thinking this all sounds too good to be true ? <eos>
 You know I need to verify this . <eos>
 Romulan ale I am surprised . I can not stand it . <eos>
 It s not quite the face you remember . <eos>
 Yes . The eyes have it . <eos>
 Our eyes reflect our lives do not they ? Yours are so confident . <eos>
 You are doing this to liberate the Remans ? <eos>
 You do not trust me . <eos>
 There s so much and so much of it s dull . <eos>
 Looking up at the stars . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And you dreamed about what was up there . About . <eos>
 After you Praetor . <eos>
 So I am not as tall as you expected ? <eos>
 I always hoped I would hit two meters . <eos>
 With a full head of hair . <eos>
 Shinzon . I am trying to believe you . <eos>
 In time Jean Luc . <eos>
 Hello Jean Luc . <eos>
 Why am I here ? <eos>
 What s this all about ? <eos>
 It s about destiny Picard . About a Reman outcast who . <eos>
 It amazes me how little you know yourself . <eos>
 You know that s not possible . <eos>
 Long ago . <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 That s your life . not mine . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 It s too late . <eos>
 You can still make a choice ! Make the right one now ! <eos>
 I hope you are still alive Jean Luc . <eos>
 Praetor we have received the transponder signal . <eos>
 Report ! <eos>
 Target disruptors . Destroy them . <eos>
 What about Picard ? <eos>
 Our greater goal s more important brother . <eos>
 Well that sounds relaxing too . <eos>
 So they ve got him up and running . <eos>
 He s a very unusual android . <eos>
 My God . <eos>
 Minimal damage to the Scimitar . <eos>
 Believe it or not I think the cavalry has arrived . <eos>
 Intruder alert ! <eos>
 Are we prepared ? <eos>
 The bond s broken . <eos>
 Find her again . <eos>
 No this s wasting time . <eos>
 It s accelerating . You have no more time for games . <eos>
 How long ? <eos>
 How long until we reach the Rift ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Praetor . <eos>
 What s it ? Focus on your job ! <eos>
 Join us Commanders . Now what s the disposition of the fleet ? <eos>
 They are holding position . <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 How many Warbirds will you need ? <eos>
 The Scimitar will serve my needs . <eos>
 But surely . <eos>
 Then I do not understand the reason for the delay ! <eos>
 You do not have to understand . <eos>
 And bringing the Enterprise here ? What possible purpose could that serve ? <eos>
 I have a purpose . <eos>
 Then perhaps you will enlight en us ? <eos>
 Praetor . <eos>
  <eos>
 Benny God take it easy . <eos>
 Right in line with that burning tree . <eos>
 What did I tell you ? <eos>
 Do not you think you should call a backup ? <eos>
 Mike call for back up . Benny you all right ? <eos>

 George we have just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial . <eos>
 When can we expect containment ? <eos>
 Well we are in pursuit of a green Mustang . <eos>
 Why did you let it get into a populated area ? <eos>
 It s taken on a disguise . <eos>
 Clarify that . <eos>
 The extraterrestrial now looks like this . <eos>
 I am afraid the situation demands that kind of risk . <eos>
 I do not like it George . <eos>

 No it s not the cut that s bothering me . <eos>

 San Francisco . <eos>
 How would you happen to come here ? <eos>
 I guess you knew that anyway . <eos>
 Different ? <eos>
 With Lydia . Did she seem a trifle distant ? <eos>
 Then why did she object to you ? <eos>
 Because she was afraid . <eos>
 Afraid you would take Mitch ? <eos>
 Afraid I would give Mitch . <eos>
 Someone ought to tell her she would be gaining a daughter . <eos>
 She already has a daughter . <eos>
 Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay ? <eos>
 You get straight to the point do not you ? <eos>
 Do you think I should go ? <eos>
 That s up to you . <eos>
 It s really up to Lydia s not it ? <eos>
 Never mind Lydia . Do you want to go ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Is anyone there ? <eos>
 Yes I did . <eos>
 Mother ! <eos>
 Mitch can I bring the lovebirds in here ? <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Mom they are in a cage ! <eos>
 They have not harmed anyone . <eos>
 Miss Daniels ? <eos>
 I still do not understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds . <eos>
 Is smoking fun ? <eos>
 Oh I suppose so . <eos>
 Could I have a puff ? <eos>
 I do not think your mother would like that . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Do not you like us ? <eos>
 Darling of course I do ! <eos>
 Do not you like Bodega Bay ? <eos>
 Oh . Where d you want the coffee ? <eos>

 The little girl s name . <eos>
 The little Brenner girl ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Are you sure ? <eos>
 Well I s not positive if that s what you mean . <eos>
 How much for the phone calls ? <eos>
 What good will that do ? Smoke s as bad as birds . <eos>
 Deke have you got a first aid kit back there ? <eos>
 What happened ? <eos>
 Young woman cut herself . <eos>
 You cut yourself outside Miss ? <eos>
 I do not think Miss Daniels s going to sue anybody . <eos>
 We do not have any fog this time of year Mitch . <eos>
 Gulls ! <eos>
 Here s your pie Sebastian . You want it at the table ? <eos>
 No . Here s fine . <eos>
 A what ? <eos>
 How do you do Miss Daniels ? Acknowledge a what ? <eos>
 Oh . I see . <eos>
 For Cathy . For her birthday . By the way where s she ? <eos>
 You did say birds ? <eos>
 Yes lovebirds . We could not let you . <eos>
 Seven o clock same as usual . <eos>
 He sold the feed to me did not he ? <eos>
 Caviat emptor Mother . Let the buyer beware . <eos>
 Whose side are you on ? <eos>
 I am simply quoting the law . <eos>
 She s a charming girl s not she Mitch ? <eos>
 Yes very . <eos>
 And certainly pretty . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 How long have you known her ? <eos>
 I told you . We met yesterday . <eos>
 In a bird shop . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way . <eos>
 Mother ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself . <eos>
 Well . So long as you know what you want Mitch . <eos>
 Well . well s everyone all right ? <eos>
 Did you you get the windows in the attic Mitch ? <eos>
 I got them all Mother . <eos>
 When do you think they will come ? <eos>
 That s a chance we have to take . <eos>
 Maybe we ought to leave . <eos>
 Not now . Not while they are massing out there . <eos>
 When ? <eos>
 I do not know when . We will see what . <eos>
 Mitch . <eos>
 Mother get a rope ! <eos>
 Oh my God look at her ! <eos>
 I can handle it . <eos>
 I am not very good at this Mitch . <eos>
 You are doing fine . <eos>
 They are gone . The same pattern . <eos>
 But they will be back . <eos>
 We wo not be here . <eos>
 They wo not be . <eos>
 If they are ? <eos>
 I started to say . inside . <eos>
 Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco s that right ? <eos>
 Where s Mitch ? <eos>
 Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm . <eos>
 Why ? Did not Al believe my story ? <eos>
 He was calling from the farm Mrs . Brenner . <eos>
 Then he saw . <eos>
 He must have . He sent for the Santa Rosa police . <eos>
 Do you think Cathy s all right ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Yes I am sure she s fine . <eos>
 Do I sound foolish to you ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And if you do not ? <eos>
 Then I do not suppose it will matter much to anyone but me . <eos>
 Would you like me to go for her ? <eos>
 I could not ask you to . <eos>
 I do not mind really . <eos>
 Would you ? I would feel so much better . <eos>
 That s the last of it . <eos>
 Did you close the door ? <eos>
 Please do not mess me up with bandages Mrs . Brenner . <eos>
 Shhhh . Shhhh . <eos>
 That s a chimney swift all right . <eos>
 Well these birds live in chimneys you know . <eos>
 What are we going to do about it Al ? <eos>
 I do not think I get you Mitch . Do about what ? <eos>
 Well if there s anything else I can do Mitch . <eos>
 Thanks Al . We will be all right . <eos>
 He was killed last night . By birds . <eos>
 There s an ordinance against burning anything in this town unless it s . <eos>
 Is that for Mitch Brenner ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 He s not home . <eos>
 Well where did he go ? <eos>
 Bodega Bay . He goes up there every weekend . <eos>
 Bodega Bay ? Where s that ? <eos>
 Up on the coast . About sixty miles north of here . <eos>
 Yes . Yes someone s got to feed them . <eos>
 I wonder if you could help me . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Yes what was it you were looking for sir ? <eos>
 Lovebirds . <eos>
 Lovebirds sir ? <eos>
 Yes . I understand there are different varieties it that true ? <eos>
 I understand completely sir . <eos>
 As the same time I would not want birds that were aloof either . <eos>
 No of course not . <eos>
 Do you have a pair that are just friendly ? <eos>
 I think so sir . Now then let me see . <eos>
 Are not these lovebirds ? <eos>
 No sir those are . redbirds . <eos>
 The sign says strawberry finches . <eos>
 Yes we call them that too . Ahhh here we are Lovebirds . <eos>
 Those are canaries Miss . Does not this make you feel awful ? <eos>
 Does not what make me . <eos>
 All these innocent little creatures caged up like this ? <eos>
 Oh certainly . It s to protect the species . <eos>
 I imagine that s very important . Especially during the moulting season . <eos>
 Yes that s a particularly dangerous time . <eos>
 Are they moulting now ? <eos>
 Some of them are . <eos>
 How can you tell ? <eos>
 What did you say ? <eos>
 I was merely drawing a parallel Miss Daniels . <eos>
 But how . how do you know my name ? <eos>
 A little birdie told me . Good day Miss Daniels . Madam . <eos>
 I do not know you . <eos>
 Ahhh but I know you . <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 We met in court . <eos>
 What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical . <eos>
 Ahhh but I really do want those birds . <eos>
 I think you are a louse . <eos>
 I am . Good day . Madam . <eos>
 And I am glad you did not get your lovebirds ! <eos>
 That was the damndest thing I ever saw . <eos>
 What made it . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 So you are a lawyer . <eos>
 That s right . What are you doing in Bodega Bay ? <eos>
 Do you practice here ? <eos>
 No San Francisco . What are you . <eos>
 What kind of law ? <eos>
 Criminal . <eos>
 Is that why you would like to see everyone behind bars ? <eos>
 Not everyone Miss Daniels . <eos>
 Ouch ! <eos>
 I am sorry . What are you doing up here ? <eos>
 Did not you see the lovebirds ? <eos>
 What for ? <eos>
 To see a friend of mine . Will you please be careful ? <eos>
 I am sorry . Who s your friend ? <eos>
 Why . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Annie . Annie Hayworth . <eos>
 Well well small world . Annie Hayworth . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 How do you know Annie ? <eos>
 We . we went to school together . College . <eos>
 Did you ! Imagine that ! How long will you be staying ? <eos>
 Oh no you do not ! <eos>
 So you came up to see Annie huh ? <eos>
 What did it say ? <eos>
 Right next to the one you already had . <eos>
 After all you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds . <eos>
 Yes but . <eos>
 You are are not you ? <eos>
 Certainly but . <eos>
 You are sure now ? You wo not hire a boat or anything ? <eos>
 I am sure . <eos>
 Seven o clock then . <eos>
 Why did he shoot her ? <eos>
 He was watching a ball game on television . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You will be able to find your way back wo not you ? <eos>
 Oh yes . <eos>
 Will I be seeing you again ? <eos>
 How does Mother know what I like to do ? <eos>
 I guess she and I read the same gossip columns . <eos>
 Oh . That . Rome . <eos>
 Mmmm . I like to swim . We might get along very . <eos>
 In case you are interested I was pushed into that fountain . <eos>
 You were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh ? <eos>
 I am neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular . <eos>
 The truth s you were running around with a pretty wild crowd . <eos>
 Yes but . <eos>
 . who did not much care for propriety or convention or . <eos>
 Sure . Do you really know Annie Hayworth ? <eos>
 No . At least I did not until I came up here . <eos>
 So you did not go to school together . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 And you did not come up here to see her . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 You were lying . <eos>
 I wrote the letter . <eos>
 But you tore it up . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Because it seemed stupid and foolish . <eos>
 Like jumping into a fountain in Rome ! <eos>
 I told you what happened in Rome ! <eos>
 Do you expect me to believe . <eos>
 I would still like to see you . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 It s for me . <eos>
 But not for me . <eos>
 I could not possibly . I have to get back . <eos>
 Cheers . <eos>
 Well . I have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing . <eos>
 You have a job ? <eos>
 I have several jobs . <eos>
 What do you do ? <eos>
 I do different things on different days . <eos>
 Helping travelers . <eos>
 And Fridays ? What do you do then ? <eos>
 Nothing . I go to bird shops on Fridays . <eos>
 I am glad you do . <eos>
 Do you know what I was doing in that shop ? <eos>
 What will it say ? <eos>
 You will think me very bold sir . <eos>
 Are you all right ? <eos>
 Do you want some mustard with this ? <eos>
 Some cream ? <eos>
 I will take Cathy up to bed . <eos>
 Are you staying ? <eos>
 Really ? Tell me about it . <eos>
 It s an uprising . <eos>
 Of birds ? <eos>
 So they united . <eos>
 Not at first . Oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks . <eos>
 Hear ! <eos>
 Why should we submit ourselves to their domination ? <eos>
 Take wing ! <eos>
 What it was probably . <eos>
 It s so damn quiet out there . <eos>
 It was like that yesterday . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 After the gulls attacked . <eos>
 Melanie Melanie . <eos>
 I am frightened Mitch . <eos>
 Melanie . <eos>
 I got here as fast as I could . Where s Cathy ? <eos>
 I think it s safe to get out now . <eos>
 Do not let s take any chances . <eos>
 The town looks clear . <eos>
 The bay does not . <eos>
 Do you want to try your father again ? <eos>
 I tried a little while ago . The phone s dead . <eos>
 Have we still got power ? <eos>
 Where are they heading ? <eos>
 Inland . <eos>
 Santa Rosa ? <eos>
 When will they stop ? <eos>
 I thought they would have stopped by now . <eos>
 What time s it ? <eos>
 Almost two a . m . <eos>
 You must be exhausted . <eos>
 The power . <eos>
 Mitch . <eos>
 We would better light some of those lamps . <eos>
 Hello Mrs . MacGruder have you ever seen so many gulls ? <eos>
 Hello Miss Daniels . <eos>
 There we are ! <eos>
 That . that . who was that ? <eos>
 Have you got a pencil ? <eos>
 No you would better send him . May I use your phone ? <eos>
 Yes certainly . <eos>
 Do you have any lovebirds ? <eos>
 No not in the shop . But I can order them for you . <eos>
 How soon ? <eos>
 What were the crows after at the school ? <eos>
 What do you think they were after Miss . <eos>
 Daniels . I think they were after the children . <eos>
 For what purpose ? <eos>
 And what ? Vultures ? Hawks ? Eagles ? <eos>
 Sebastian I am not an alarmist . <eos>
 Look Mitch even if this s true even if all the birds . <eos>
 It s happening . Is not that a good enough reason ? <eos>
 Help how ? What do you want to do ? <eos>
 I am not sure but . <eos>
 How do you plan to do that ? <eos>
 Scotch light on the water . <eos>
 We need them . <eos>
 Not if they are starting a war . <eos>
 Kill them all . Get rid of them . Messy animals . <eos>
 How many gulls did you count Mrs . Bundy ? <eos>
 Which gulls Mr . Sholes ? There are several varieties . <eos>
 Actually those gulls must have been after the fish . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 I am going out that way lady . You can follow me . <eos>
 Then let s go . Now ! <eos>
 I have not finished my drink . <eos>
 Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today ? Are you coming ? <eos>
 I am leaving ! Are you coming ? <eos>
 I am Donald Fettes . <eos>
 I am very pleased to know you Master Fettes . <eos>
 Dr . MacFarlane said I should pay you <eos>
 I fear he may have to . <eos>
 Oh you will have ample opportunity ample Good morning Dr . Fettes . <eos>
 You asked to see me ma am ? <eos>
 I want you to help my little girl . <eos>
 I do not know that I can do that Mrs . Marsh . <eos>
 Ask this one favor <eos>
 You have his promise then ? <eos>
 Good morning Mrs . Marsh . <eos>
 You must leave this house . <eos>
 I can not do that you heard MacFarlane . <eos>
 Save yourself . Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned . <eos>
 You are over excited Mistress Cameron . <eos>
 But that s long since . Gray can not threaten him with that . <eos>
 And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke ? <eos>
 He s not home . <eos>
 Excuse me Dr . MacFarlane <eos>
 Dr . MacFarlane <eos>
 I am afraid I will have to give up medicine Dr . MacFarlane . <eos>
 I thought only the best students were made assistants . <eos>
 Well ? And are you not a good student ? <eos>
 You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection ? <eos>
 Really Fettes you irk me with your lack of understanding . <eos>
 Wilmont used up the last spinal section . <eos>
 You see it s completely out of the question . <eos>
 Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one . <eos>
 Well <eos>
 Gray killed her . <eos>
 I would not do that Fettes . I would not report it . <eos>
 She s unconscious . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I know it I know it The moment I was rid of him <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Glencorse that s a lonely cemetery Fettes not a soul around for miles . <eos>
 Where shall we put it ? In the back ? <eos>
 This s not a woman ! <eos>
 It was a woman when we put her in . <eos>
 Are you a doctor too ? <eos>
 Not yet . <eos>
 Why yes . <eos>
 Why do you want the white horse to bid you good day ? <eos>
 Aye but I still wonder how much . <eos>
 I thought this was a school day . <eos>
 You will not need that again Georgina . <eos>
 I am by way of being a medical myself . <eos>
 Come Toddy come . Sit down here with me . <eos>
 Mr . Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss . <eos>
 I will not have you use that name to me . <eos>
 I am the best man for the job . <eos>
 It might be an interesting case . <eos>
 Toddy hates me . <eos>
 Do not call me that confounded name I tell you . <eos>
 You know something about the human body Gray . <eos>
 Oh it s the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about . <eos>
 The nerve centers the brain <eos>
 But what makes a thought start ? <eos>
 What are you going here ? Have I not told you <eos>
 I brought you something tonight MacFarlane an interesting specimen in very good condition . <eos>
 I have ordered nothing from you . <eos>
 This s a gift . <eos>
 I take no gifts from you . <eos>
 This s a gift you will not return . <eos>
 Get out of here ! <eos>
 Surely you are not threatening an old friend Toddy . <eos>
 Have another glass of something good Toddy . <eos>
 I have drunk enough tonight . <eos>
 Would you bribe me to leave you be ? <eos>
 What did you hear ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Can anyone hear what we say ? <eos>
 Only Brother . <eos>
 Burke them ? <eos>
 You are lately come to Scotland Joseph ? <eos>
 The ruffian dogs the Hellish pair . The villain Burke the meager Hare <eos>
 How long after that was the paralysis complete ? <eos>
 Nearly a year . <eos>
 Any attacks of pain since ? <eos>
 Yes Doctor . <eos>
 A carriage overturned . My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt . <eos>
 How long ago ? <eos>
 But she must be able to move . Everything s in place . <eos>
 Aye <eos>
 Crony indeed ! <eos>
 Fettes where s Fettes ? <eos>
 You are not going to Gray . <eos>
 You have been with Gray again . <eos>
 I hate that picture . <eos>
 Where are they ? <eos>
 Can I get you something ? A glass of water ? A transfusion ? <eos>
 Where are they ? Last chance . <eos>
 How many innocent people did you leave dead back there ? <eos>
 Tell her . we will get him . <eos>
 Check and mate . <eos>
 Two down . Two to go . <eos>
 You think I am crazy . <eos>
 What do they do that they had to kill her ? <eos>
 I was hoping you would find out . <eos>
 The strip joint ? <eos>
 Where s it ? This place ? <eos>
 I think we should get some support ? <eos>
 That was a fucking hollow point ! <eos>
 Think maybe knives do ? <eos>
 Sssshhh . She s resting . <eos>
 You lied at my trial . <eos>
 Wrong . Answer . <eos>
 What did they give you ? <eos>
 What Scar ? What fucking scar ? <eos>
 Fucking Zombie . <eos>
 The scar . <eos>
 I heard you were looking for this . <eos>
 You are the guy killed Dutton . <eos>
 Fuck . Me . <eos>
 The scar . Which of you has it ? <eos>
 Are you out of your fucking mind ? We are going to die . <eos>
 How can you die if you are already dead ? <eos>
 You are him . Corvis . <eos>

 I am not hiding . I am right here . <eos>
 From the bonfire over there . Look at it . <eos>
 No ! Why are you haunting me ? <eos>
 This s where it happened . Right over here . <eos>

 They botched the execution . <eos>
 Could say that . <eos>
 Fucking crow . <eos>
 How about sign of a big black bird ? <eos>
 Just do not believe everything you see . <eos>
 Doubt s a motherfucker . <eos>
 Maybe we had a case of that here . Get me my kit . <eos>
 You mean Alex . <eos>
 Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident . <eos>
 I do . Every day . <eos>
 Anything wrong ? <eos>
 What s with your friend there ? <eos>
 She s . sick . Actually she never had Mai Tais before . <eos>
 But you you have had them . <eos>
 You want me to walk a straight line ? <eos>
 I want you . to bend over . <eos>
 Look can I just call a cab ? <eos>
 Why are there so many ? <eos>
 I want to take this to Lauren . She would want it . <eos>
 Honey . I just can not . <eos>
 Stay in the car . I will only take a second . <eos>
 Erin ! <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren . <eos>
 It still does not mean . <eos>
 I think I dropped an earring . <eos>
 You are in with them . <eos>
 It s not what you think . <eos>
 You killed her ! <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Stay away from me ! Stay away ! <eos>
 They killed her because she found out . <eos>
 About you . <eos>
 Sweetheart . <eos>
 I would never hurt you or Lauren . Never . Believe me . <eos>
 I do not believe you . <eos>
 Please . Come inside . <eos>
 Thanks I am enjoying it right here . <eos>
 The whole city has stopped . People are running around like ants ! <eos>
 Good . Did you speak to our friend Mr . Carpenter ? <eos>
 Yes sir it certainly does ! <eos>
 Almost negligible . With variation of parameters this s the answer . <eos>
 I would like to explain something of my mission here . <eos>
 I leave that in your hands . <eos>
 You would have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting ? <eos>
 Such power exists ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Would such a demonstration be possible before the meeting ? <eos>
 That can easily be arranged . <eos>
 Hi Mom ! <eos>
 Did you have a nice day dear ? <eos>
 Professor Barnhardt . <eos>
 Yeah sure . Mom do I have to go to school tomorrow ? <eos>
 Of course dear . <eos>
 Go to bed darling . You can finish that in the morning . <eos>
 Mom s there something wrong with Mr . Carpenter ? <eos>

 I could not go to sleep Mom . I had to tell you ! <eos>
 Bobby you have been dreaming again . <eos>
 He gave these to you ? <eos>
 Gee Mom do you think maybe he s a diamond smuggler ? <eos>
 Oh boy can I Mom ? <eos>

 Are you an FBI man ? <eos>
 Bobby who s the greatest man in America today ? <eos>
 He lives here in Washington does not he ? <eos>
 Sure . Right near where my mother works . <eos>
 Well atomic power I would imagine . <eos>
 I thought that was only for bombs . <eos>
 No . It s for a lot of other things too . <eos>
 You think it can go faster than an F 36 ? <eos>
 Gee ! How could they make a landing ? <eos>
 You think they will ever find him ? <eos>
 I do not know Bobby . I am inclined to doubt it . <eos>
 Mr . Carpenter what does velocity mean ? <eos>
 You are just kidding are not you ? <eos>
 Would not you like to meet him ? <eos>
 Well sure I would but Aw I will bet you would be scared . <eos>
 What does that mean ? <eos>
 It s a problem in celestial mechanics . <eos>
 Did all these people die in wars ? <eos>
 Sure . Did not you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery ? <eos>
 No I am afraid not . <eos>
 Go to the movies . <eos>
 All right . <eos>

 Let s not say anything to my mother about this Mr . Carpenter . <eos>
 Why not Bobby ? <eos>
 Mrs . Benson this s Mr . Brady . <eos>

 All you have to remember s first find the common denominator then subtract . <eos>
 Thanks Mr . Carpenter . <eos>
 Bobby have you a flashlight ? <eos>
 I do not believe it . <eos>
 Their life expectancy s a hundred and thirty . <eos>
 About five months your months . <eos>
 You must have come a long way . <eos>
 Naturally we are very curious to know where it s you come from . <eos>
 The present situation ? <eos>

 I I am not sure I understand <eos>
 I traveled 250 million miles . What about your United Nations ? <eos>
 Good afternoon . I am glad to see you up and around . <eos>

 You wait and see . You are going to marry a big hero ! <eos>
 I do not know how to thank you . <eos>
 Everyone seems so <eos>

 Where s the meeting going to be ? <eos>

 What else can they do ? <eos>
 There s a place that might help . we could try going there . <eos>
 Where ? <eos>

 Twice . <eos>
 Is that what you were trained to do ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Then what do you think he was trying to do . <eos>

 The guy on the phone . <eos>

 Blocked . <eos>
 Professor Tripp ? <eos>
 Hm . <eos>
 How s that ? <eos>
 I guess there s probably a story behind that . <eos>

 You seem a little hostile today . <eos>
 Walter I would like you to try something for me . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I would like you to keep a journal . <eos>
 A diary ? <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 No way . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Diaries have sent too many guys to prison . <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 Ev i dence . <eos>
 Oh . It never crossed my mind . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 It was just an idea . <eos>
 Bad idea . <eos>
 I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect . <eos>
 Reflect . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 You think reflection s good . <eos>
 It s very good indeed . <eos>
 Try it . <eos>
 No fucking way . <eos>
 How s the journal ? <eos>
 I am still thinking about it . <eos>
 You do not like coming here do you ? <eos>
 It s okay . <eos>
 But you do not like coming here . Be honest Walter . <eos>
 Honest ? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch . <eos>
 Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch ? <eos>
 How do you feel about that ? <eos>
 I do not feel anything . <eos>
 Then why are you talking about this ? <eos>
 Have to talk about something . <eos>
 Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns ? <eos>
 I am not that crazy . <eos>
 Do you think you are crazy ? <eos>
 If I am not then what the hell am I doing here ? <eos>
 Why do you think you are here ? <eos>
 You know why . It s part of the parole deal . <eos>
 Is that what you are angry about ? <eos>
 How long s this going to take ? <eos>
 We have a few more minutes . <eos>
 I mean when will I be normal . <eos>
 We have a lot of work to do . <eos>
 Will I ever be normal ? <eos>
 I could not say . <eos>
 You could not say . <eos>
 I am afraid not . <eos>
 Do you know what normal is ? <eos>
 I suppose it s however society defines it . <eos>
 How do you define it ? <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 Then how do you know if your patients are getting better ? <eos>
 They usually tell me . <eos>
 How do they know ? <eos>
 What s your idea of being normal ? <eos>

 We will talk about it more on Thursday . <eos>
 Remember when you asked me what my idea of normal was ? <eos>
 You are very late . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 Please do not do it again . <eos>
 I said I was sorry . <eos>
 When did it all start ? <eos>
 You mean my problem ? <eos>
 If by problem you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes . <eos>

 That s not a helpful answer . <eos>
 Close your eyes . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I would like you to close your eyes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 To relax . <eos>
 I am relaxed . <eos>
 Close your eyes and let your mind be blank . <eos>

 Just lying there . We are taking a nap . <eos>
 What the hell are you doing there ? <eos>
 Did you and your sister often take naps together ? <eos>
 Do not ever do that again . <eos>

 Walter what did you do while taking a nap with your sister ? <eos>
 This s garbage ! <eos>
 What else ? <eos>
 That s all . I just liked smelling her hair . <eos>
 You felt pleasure . <eos>
 Did you get an erection ? <eos>
 I was six years old ! <eos>
 It was a small house . <eos>
 It s going to take time Walter . <eos>
 Time . <eos>
 How do you feel about that ? <eos>

 Are you okay ? <eos>
 Want a ride ? <eos>
 I am all right . <eos>
 There s something wrong with this picture . <eos>
 What picture ? <eos>
 I am talking about you . <eos>
 Me ? <eos>
 Very weird . <eos>
 No weirder than a sharp young good looking woman working in a lumberyard . <eos>
 What s weird about that ? <eos>
 Most women would not choose it . <eos>
 You are quiet at work . <eos>
 I am just quiet . <eos>
 You do not hang out with the other guys . <eos>
 Neither do you . <eos>
 You never spoke to me before . <eos>
 Are you ? <eos>
 Southern light . <eos>

 What about bears ? <eos>
 What about them ? <eos>
 They could eat you . <eos>

 Something happened to you . <eos>
 I am not easily shocked . <eos>
 I get that impression . <eos>
 So . what s your dark secret ? <eos>
 Why do you want to know ? <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 So you are not a dyke . <eos>

 I molested little girls . <eos>
 Molested little girls ? <eos>
 You are not joking . <eos>

 Sorry . <eos>
 What did you do to them ? <eos>
 It s not what you think . <eos>
 I never hurt them . Never . <eos>
 Why do not you just go now okay ? <eos>
 I told you I am not easily shocked . <eos>
 You should be shocked . Or do you get off on this shit ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Get your kicks somewhere else . <eos>

 Is it their innocence ? Their beauty ? <eos>
 Their power . They seduce me . <eos>
 They seduce you ? <eos>
 I was always the one seduced . <eos>
 You really believe that ? <eos>
 No . That s what I used to tell myself . <eos>
 And what do you tell yourself now ? <eos>
 Nothing . It s over . <eos>

 Most people say the odds are against me . <eos>
 What odds ? <eos>
 I got poked around . here and there . <eos>

 You must hate your brothers . <eos>
 I love my brothers . <eos>
 You never asked them about it ? <eos>
 Are you serious ? <eos>
 Not ever ? <eos>
 Maybe this s not a good idea . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You are scared . <eos>
 I am not scared . <eos>
 Neither am I . <eos>
 We should live together . <eos>
 Live together . <eos>
 It s a bad idea . <eos>
 I do not even know how to live with myself . <eos>
 Just think about it . <eos>
 I have got problems . <eos>
 Who does not ? <eos>
 Most people do not have my kind of problems . <eos>
 Guess that makes you pretty special . <eos>
 I say we call it quits . <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>

 Which one shall I wear ? <eos>
 This one s gorgeous . <eos>
 Claudia are not you coming ? <eos>
 I am certainly not going to swim across . <eos>
 And how long will you be away ? <eos>
 And have you any other truths to tell me ? <eos>
 These people are contemptible . They have no sense of dignity at all . <eos>
 What s that one over there called ? <eos>
 That must be Basiluzzo . <eos>
 At what ? <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 Well what ? <eos>
 Have you decided ? <eos>

 Shall we go for a swim ? <eos>
 Twelve years . But why have not they married ? <eos>
 Find anything ? <eos>
 Are you feeling better ? <eos>
 I am sorry about last night . Please forgive me . <eos>
 You are very fond of Anna are not you ? <eos>

 Yes you should go . <eos>
 And what about you ? <eos>
 Claudia listen to me . <eos>
 Sandro . maybe it s best that you go in alone . <eos>
 Does it please you to say such things ? <eos>
 Oh no . It does not please me at all . <eos>
 Why are you looking at me like that ? <eos>
 Claudia let s get married ? <eos>
 But why am I so infatuated with you ? <eos>
 Hurry up now or it will begin to get hot outside . <eos>
 But you know it already . Why must I tell you ? <eos>
 Then I will see you later . <eos>
 Sandro . What s the matter ? <eos>
 No Sandro . Please . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Sandro listen . Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow . <eos>

 Why ? <eos>
 Good night my love . <eos>
 Good night . Tell me that you love me . <eos>
 I love you . <eos>
 Tell me once more . <eos>
 I do not love you . <eos>
 Tell me Claudia what do you think of Raimondo ? <eos>
 I would say he s pretty depraved . <eos>
 One would have to be in love with somebody to know that . <eos>
 Have you ever been in love ? <eos>
 To do what ? <eos>
 But where did you finally end up ? <eos>
 It s divine ! <eos>
 You say that just to flatter me . <eos>
 Do you consider that a compliment ? <eos>
 I am not coming . <eos>
 Should not we try to find a quieter place ? <eos>
 My childhood instead was a very sensible one . <eos>
 What do you mean by sensible ? <eos>
 Patrizia . Patrizia . Where s Ettore ? <eos>
 Patrizia I am afraid . <eos>
 Who are you talking to ? <eos>
 Please you come too . <eos>
 They are all nudes if I am not mistaken . <eos>
 Now what do I have to do to be left in peace ? <eos>
 It s as smooth and slick as oil . <eos>
 At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes . <eos>
 I will stay here also . <eos>
 But why ? What if it starts to rain ? <eos>
 But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat ? <eos>
 There too . <eos>
 And what are we going to do now ? <eos>
 First let the poor thing have something to eat . <eos>
 Ettore . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Nothing nothing at all . I was just looking for Sandro . <eos>
 And you expect to find him in here ? Go and ask Claudia . <eos>
 Where s she going ? <eos>
 Giulia . <eos>
 Because there s no landscape as beautiful as a woman . <eos>
 And where do you find the models ? <eos>
 Oh there are as many as one wants . <eos>
 But how could they pose like that ? I could not . <eos>
 Why do not you try ? <eos>
 But why me ? Ask Claudia she s much more beautiful than me . <eos>
 But I want to paint you . You appeal to me more . <eos>
 And who s she ? Does she work in Catania ? <eos>
 We have a radio like this too . <eos>
 No not like this one . <eos>
 And why would not we have one like this ? <eos>
 Anything new develop ? <eos>
 Look Marshal with those deep crevasses you will need some rope and ladders . <eos>
 Do not worry we have got everything . <eos>
 Another thing there s an old man who lives here on the island . <eos>
 And do you remember where she got off ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Are you the owner of this place ? <eos>
 No . The owners are in Australia . <eos>
 But where did you come from ? <eos>

 And how come you are up so early ? <eos>
 Did you manage to find good rooms ? <eos>
 Why have we stopped ? <eos>
 Zuria ? <eos>

 I would like to ask you something . <eos>
 She costs a hundred thousand lire . <eos>
 You really must do me this one favor . <eos>
 He talked to you Himself ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Through someone else ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 I can not say . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 She would punish me . <eos>
 One of the other Sisters ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Because I am getting fat . <eos>
 Oh for Heaven s sake . <eos>
 I am there s too much flesh on me . <eos>
 Agnes . <eos>
 I am a blimp . <eos>
 Why does it matter whether you are fat or not . <eos>
 Because . <eos>
 . You need not worry about being attractive here . <eos>
 I do I have to be attractive to God . <eos>
 He loves you the way you are . <eos>
 No he does not . He hates fat people . <eos>
 Who told you this ? <eos>
 It s a sin to be fat . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Look at the statues they are thin . <eos>
 Your mother tells you this ? Agnes your mother s dead . <eos>
 But she watches . she listens . <eos>
 Nonsense I am your mother now and I want you to eat . <eos>
 I am not hungry . <eos>
 You have got to eat something Agnes . <eos>
 Of God . <eos>

 Because I do not want one . <eos>
 If you did want one how would you go about getting one ? <eos>
 From someone who did not want to have a baby . <eos>
 How would that person get one if they did not want one ? <eos>
 A mistake . <eos>

 The bishop s breathing down our necks . <eos>

 Larry . <eos>

 Martha it s you . <eos>
 Would you tell me why the hell this s taking so long . <eos>
 ? <eos>
 All I want s one more week . <eos>
 Why ? You have done nothing to show any progress . <eos>
 Yes that s because I am getting to her . <eos>
 You are getting to all of us Martha let s face it . <eos>
 I will have a decision by next week . <eos>
 It s gone on long enough . You are out . <eos>
 Oh Joe . Joe she did not kill the baby . <eos>
 You have proof ? <eos>

 Hello Mama . brought you something . <eos>
 Shut up I am trying to watch this . <eos>
 It s your favourite . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 It s Martha Mama . There you go . <eos>
 Marie brings me icecream too you know . Chocolate . my favourite . <eos>
 I thought cherry vanilla was your favourite . <eos>
 Mama that was not Marie that was me ! <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 Oh that one there in the corner . <eos>
 The one up on the third floor ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why do you call it an investigation ? I never have . <eos>
 Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her . <eos>
 And you had a sister who died in the convent . <eos>
 Who told you this ? <eos>
 Do you still go to church ? <eos>
 What business s it of yours . <eos>
 Yes . I . <eos>
 You can call me Sister . <eos>
 You were a smoker ? <eos>
 Two packs a day . <eos>
 I can beat that . <eos>
 Who knew about Agnes pregnancy ? <eos>
 No one . <eos>
 How did she hide it from the other nuns ? <eos>
 She undressed alone . she bathed alone . <eos>
 Is that normal ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Who was the father ? <eos>
 I have not a clue . <eos>
 What man had access to her ? <eos>
 None as far as I know . <eos>
 Was there a priest ? <eos>
 Yes but I . <eos>
 What s his name ? <eos>
 Father Martineau but I do not see him as a candidate . <eos>
 Could there have been anyone else ? <eos>
 Obviously there was . <eos>
 And you did not try to find out who ? <eos>
 Believe me I have done everything possible short of asking Agnes . <eos>
 Why do you think that ? <eos>
 What s your opinion ? <eos>
 I believe Agnes s different . <eos>
 So someone else could have done it . <eos>
 No . not in the eyes of the police . <eos>
 And in your eyes ? <eos>
 You do not really believe something like that happened do you ? <eos>
 It s possible s not it ? <eos>
 That s absurd ! <eos>
 That possibility never occurred to you ? <eos>
 When did you first learn about her . innocence the way she thinks ? <eos>
 Shortly after she came to us . <eos>
 And you were not shocked ? <eos>
 I was appalled just as you are now . <eos>
 And what happened ? <eos>
 This was before her pregnancy ? <eos>
 Why did not you take her to a doctor ? <eos>
 She has it now . <eos>
 I know what you are thinking she s a hysteric pure and simple . <eos>
 You hate us do not you ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Nuns . you hate nuns . <eos>
 I hate ignorance and stupidity . <eos>
 The Catholic Church . <eos>
 It s my affair too . <eos>
 Then help her . <eos>
 I am . <eos>
 There s another choice . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Aquittal . <eos>
 All right what do you need . <eos>
 When would Agnes have conceived the child ? <eos>
 Oh some time in January . <eos>
 Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time ? <eos>
 Earthquakes ? <eos>
 Visitors to the convent . <eos>
 Nothing . <eos>
 Do you have a . a diary or a day book ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 There s nothing here . <eos>
 Was the child full term ? <eos>
 Oh Dear God . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 The sheets . <eos>
 What sheets ? <eos>
 You lied to me <eos>
 About what ? <eos>
 Your niece ! <eos>
 I did not tell you because I did not think it was important . <eos>
 Like keeping her home from school ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Listening to angels ? <eos>
 She drank too much . That s what killed her . <eos>
 Do you know what she did to her ? <eos>
 I do not think I care to know . <eos>
 She molested her ! <eos>
 I knew that after the fact . <eos>
 Why did not you do anything to stop her ? <eos>
 Because I did not know . <eos>
 And my permission ? <eos>
 We will see about that . <eos>
 Do not deny it ! <eos>
 I have not decided yet . <eos>
 The woman s health s at stake . <eos>
 Her spiritual health . <eos>
 I do not give a damn about her spiritual health . <eos>
 Because I am a moral person . <eos>
 Bullshit ! <eos>
 Bullshit yourself ! <eos>
 Catholic Church does not have a corner on morality . <eos>
 Who said anything about the Catholic Church . <eos>
 You just said . <eos>
 What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you ? <eos>
 No it reminds me . <eos>
 Would you like one ? Huh ? <eos>
 I am out of prac . . practice . <eos>
 All right ? <eos>
 Undoubtedly . Not the ascetics of course but well Saint Thomas More . <eos>
 Hand rolled . <eos>
 Even Christ would partake socially . <eos>
 Saint Peter ? <eos>
 Pipe ! <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 Mary Magdelen ? <eos>
 Oh you have come a long way baby . <eos>
 Do you think they ever existed ? <eos>
 Yes I do . <eos>
 Do you want to become one ? <eos>
 Become ? One s born a saint . <eos>
 Do you think Agnes s still attached to God ? <eos>
 Listen to her singing . <eos>
 I would like to begin . <eos>
 Begin what ? <eos>
 The hypnotism . Do you still disapprove ? <eos>
 Would it stop you if I did ? <eos>
 May I be present ? <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Stop this she will hurt herself I am not going to allow this . <eos>
 One that will ask the questions you want asked . <eos>
 One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect . <eos>
 For the Church ? <eos>
 For Agnes . <eos>
 You think she s a saint ? <eos>
 The father ! <eos>
 Who s he ? <eos>
 Why must he be anybody ? <eos>
 My God you are as crazy as . <eos>
 Stop laughing I do not say it s the truth I am saying . <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 Do not be ridiculous . <eos>
 But how did it happen ? <eos>
 You will never find the answer for everything God did . <eos>
 That s crazy . How could she find out about it ? <eos>
 Oh would you stop lying Mother ! <eos>
 I am concerned about her health . <eos>
 This s permission to take her apart . <eos>
 Where s she ? <eos>
 Has not she had enough ? <eos>
 I have a few more questions to ask her . <eos>
 Who knew she was pregnant ? <eos>
 Why do you insist upon pressing . <eos>
 Was it you ? <eos>
 Is it because she s a nun ? <eos>
 Did you know she was pregnant ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And you did not send her to a doctor . <eos>
 I did not guess until it was too late . <eos>
 For what ? An abortion ? <eos>
 Oh do not be ridiculous . <eos>
 Too late for what ? <eos>
 I do not know . too late to stop it . <eos>
 The baby ? <eos>
 The scandal . <eos>
 You went to the room to help with the birth . <eos>
 She did not want any help . <eos>
 You wanted that child out of the way . <eos>
 That s a lie . <eos>
 And the baby . <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Before or after you killed the child ? <eos>
 I left it with her and I went for help . <eos>
 I doubt that s what she would say . <eos>
 That s enough . <eos>
 Agnes what happened to the baby ? <eos>
 She can not remember . <eos>
 Oh do not do this ! <eos>
 Lay them down . <eos>
 Eh ? <eos>
 Lay them down . <eos>
 We would be thrown out . <eos>

 Breathe deeply . <eos>

 How long to fix ? <eos>
 Hard to say . <eos>

 Jay . how s it coming on the repairs ? <eos>
 Well . I am going to have to blow the engines out . <eos>
 And when will you be ready to do that ? <eos>
 Oh I am not near ready yet . <eos>
 Then why the hell are you sitting around here ? <eos>
 It s really on there tight . <eos>
 Hey guess what ? <eos>

 This dust s getting clogged in the intakes again ! <eos>
 Might even incinerate the damn thing . <eos>
 So it s trapped in between now we have to drive it out . <eos>
 No I do not want us separated . <eos>
 All right . but do u not u go below decks . <eos>

 Where did it come from ? <eos>

 Blood s thoroughly oxygenated . <eos>
 God that smoke s poisonous ! <eos>
 I never saw anything like that in my life . except molecular acid . <eos>
 But this thing uses it for u blood u . <eos>
 It makes me sick to see him like that . <eos>
 It s a crude symbolic language looks primitive . <eos>
 We can not go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose . <eos>
 It s over Hunter . <eos>
 Boy that s terrific . <eos>
 That thing God almighty did not you try to get it off him ? <eos>
 Hey now what s this ? <eos>

 Still unconscious ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>

 The machine will bring his temperature down . His vital functions are strong . <eos>
 Sounds like a rough one . <eos>
 We have got six hours left . <eos>
 Oh my God . <eos>
 u How u ? <eos>
 You can not say that I think it s a good plan . <eos>
 The ship s gravitational attraction must have drawn him back . <eos>
 It will be . <eos>

 No it s coming . <eos>

 It wo not come it s stuck . <eos>
 It s not coming off not without his whole face coming off too . <eos>

 No thank God . just missed him . <eos>

 We are going home . We are in hyperspace . <eos>
 The commander normally has first publication rights . <eos>

 Phoebe . <eos>
 Phoebe ? <eos>
 May I come in ? <eos>
 You are more than modest . <eos>
 It s not modesty . I just do not try to kid myself . <eos>
 A revolutionary approach to the Theater . However if I may a suggestion . <eos>
 After you change if you are not busy elsewhere we can have supper . <eos>
 Eddie . <eos>
 You take charge . <eos>
 Hungry ? <eos>
 Just some coffee . <eos>
 I am not surprised . After all that humble pie . <eos>

 What a day what a heavenly day . <eos>
 D day . <eos>
 Are you that sure of tomorrow ? <eos>

 All paved with diamonds and gold ? <eos>
 You know me better than that . <eos>
 Paved with what then ? <eos>
 What time ? <eos>
 You could sleep too could not you ? <eos>
 We are ? <eos>
 I did not mean just the Theater . <eos>
 So that s it . Lloyd . Still just the Theater after all . <eos>
 I am in love with Lloyd ! <eos>
 Lloyd Richards s commercially the most successful playwright in America <eos>
 You have no right to say such things ! <eos>
 . and Karen . <eos>
 I see . And when was this unholy alliance joined ? <eos>
 We decided the night before last before we came up here . <eos>
 There never was there will never be another like you . <eos>
 What do you take me for ? <eos>
 I never intended you to be . <eos>
 it s important right now that we talk . Killer to killer . <eos>
 What have you got to do with it ? <eos>
 Everything . Because after tonight you will belong to me . <eos>
 I can not believe my ears . <eos>
 A dull cliche . <eos>
 Your name s not Eve Harrington . It s Gertrude Slescynski . <eos>
 She was a liar she was a liar ! <eos>
 Then say so . <eos>
 Yes Addison . <eos>
 And you realize you agree how completely you belong to me ? <eos>
 Yes Addison . <eos>
 I do not suppose there s a drink left . <eos>
 You can have one at Max s . <eos>
 I do not think I am going . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 No it s not . It s for this . <eos>
 It s the same thing s not it ? <eos>
 Exactly . Here . Take it to the party instead of me . <eos>
 Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits ? <eos>
 Feeling better my dear ? <eos>
 Like I just swam the English Channel . Now what ? <eos>
 Tell me this . Do they have auditions for television ? <eos>
 In my case it s necessary . Too many taxi drivers write plays . <eos>
 Then stop being a star start treating your guests as your supporting cast ! <eos>
 She was magnificent . <eos>
 Then you have heard too . <eos>
 I was there . An eyewitness . <eos>
 You were there ? At the play last night ? <eos>
 Margo . <eos>
 You have heard of her great interest in the Theater <eos>
 We have that in common . <eos>
 The ladies shall we say lounge ? <eos>
 I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy . Eve Harrington . <eos>
 Eve ! My understudy . <eos>
 Did not you know ? <eos>
 Of course I knew . <eos>
 How . how was Miss Caswell ? <eos>
 Frankly I do not remember . <eos>
 How nice . <eos>

 Only in some ways . You are prettier . <eos>
 Oh well . . look through the wigs maybe it got caught <eos>
 Real diamonds in a wig . The world we live in . <eos>
 Ca not keep his eyes off my legs . <eos>
 Like a nylon lemon peel <eos>
 She s quite a girl that what s her name . <eos>
 Eve . I would forgotten they grew that way . <eos>
 The lack of pretense that sort of strange directness and understanding <eos>
 Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant ? <eos>
 Take care of yourself out there . <eos>
 I understand they have got the Indians pretty well in hand . <eos>
 Bill . <eos>
 Huh ? <eos>
 Do not get stuck on some glamour puss <eos>
 I will try . <eos>
 You are not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy <eos>
 Everybody can not be Gregory Peck . <eos>
 you are a setup for some gorgeous wide eyed young babe . <eos>
 And cut that out right now . <eos>
 Am I going to lose you Bill ? Am I ? <eos>
 Knit me a muffler . <eos>
 What a thoughtful ever lovin thing to do <eos>
 Bill ? Have I gone crazy Bill ? <eos>
 You are my girl are not you ? <eos>
 That I am . <eos>
 Then you are crazy . <eos>
 Sing it ? <eos>
 Many happy returns of the day . <eos>

 It s no secret I know all about the party Eve wrote me . <eos>

 I love you too . Good night darling <eos>
 It s a good thought . <eos>
 Happy little housewife . <eos>
 Looks like I am going to have a very fancy party . <eos>
 I thought you were going to be late <eos>
 When I am guest of honor ? <eos>
 She s a girl of so many interests . <eos>
 It s a pretty rare quality these days . <eos>
 She s a girl of so many rare qualities . <eos>
 Twenty minutes ! <eos>
 For instance what ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Would not you feel more natural taking a bow ? <eos>
 It s all over . <eos>
 What s all over ? <eos>
 What fire and music ? <eos>
 Addison ! <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 The kid . Junior . <eos>
 Gone . <eos>
 I must have frightened her away . <eos>
 I would not be surprised . Sometimes you frighten me . <eos>
 Poor little flower . Just dropped her petals and folded her tent . <eos>
 Do not mix your metaphors . <eos>
 I mix what I like . <eos>
 Okay . Mix . <eos>
 I am nothing but a body with a voice . No mind . <eos>
 What a body what a voice . <eos>
 The ex ship news reporter . No body no voice all mind ! <eos>
 The gong rang . The fight s over . Calm down . <eos>
 I will not calm down ! <eos>
 Do not calm down . <eos>
 You are being terribly tolerant are not you ? <eos>
 I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts ! <eos>
 It s obvious you are not a woman . <eos>
 I have been aware of that for some time . <eos>
 Well I am . <eos>
 I will say . <eos>
 Do not be condescending . <eos>
 Margo let s make peace . <eos>
 I wish it were . <eos>
 Then what would be enough ? If we were married ? <eos>
 Bill . . where are you going ? To find Eve ? <eos>
 He does not exaggerate . I was good . <eos>
 To Margo . To my bride to be . <eos>
 Groom may I have a wedding present ? <eos>
 Never try to outguess Margo . <eos>
 Groom . <eos>
 Yes dear . <eos>
 You know what I am going to be ? <eos>
 A cowboy . <eos>
 A married lady . <eos>
 Hello what s your name ? <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I just wondered . <eos>
 Just wondered what ? <eos>
 Why . <eos>
 Why what ? <eos>
 Why you have to go out there . <eos>
 I do not have to . I want to . <eos>
 Is it the money ? <eos>
 But Hollywood . You must not stay there . <eos>
 It s only one picture deal . <eos>
 So few come back . <eos>
 I read George Jean Nathan every week . <eos>
 Also Addison deWitt . <eos>
 Every day . <eos>
 I think we would like very much . Sure you wo not mind ? <eos>
 Thanks for your help . good luck . <eos>
 Is that what you want me to be ? <eos>
 I am talking about you . And what you want . <eos>
 So am I . <eos>
 What have I got to do with it ? <eos>
 Everything . <eos>
 Do not run away Bill . <eos>
 From what would I be running ? <eos>
 You are always after truth on the stage . What about off ? <eos>
 When I told you what every young actress should know . <eos>
 When you told me that whatever I became it would be because of you <eos>
 Your make up s a little heavy . <eos>
 and for you . <eos>
 You are quite a girl . <eos>
 You think ? <eos>
 I am in love with Margo . Had not you heard ? <eos>
 Lemme fix you a drink . <eos>
 Margo does not play a lunatic Birdie . <eos>
 The bed looks like a dead animal act . Which one s sables ? <eos>
 What did you expect live sables ? <eos>
 It was Fort Sumter they fired on <eos>
 You need new girdles . <eos>
 Buy some . <eos>
 The same size ? <eos>
 How do you do my dear . <eos>
 And this s my good friend and companion Miss Birdie Coonan . <eos>
 Oh brother . <eos>
 She too s a great admirer of yours . <eos>
 Kill the people . Got your key ? <eos>
 You bought the new girdles a size smaller . I can feel it . <eos>
 Behind in your dues ? How much ? <eos>
 I have not got a union . I am slave labor . <eos>
 Birdie <eos>
 Hmm ? <eos>
 You do not like Eve do you ? <eos>
 Do you want an argument or an answer ? <eos>
 An answer . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Now you want an argument . <eos>
 She works hard . <eos>
 Night an day . <eos>
 She s loyal and efficient <eos>
 Like an agent with one client . <eos>
 She thinks only for me . . does not she ? <eos>
 Well . let s say she thinks only about you anyway . <eos>
 You all put together ? <eos>
 The caterer had to back for hors d oeuvres Voila . <eos>
 Late for what ? <eos>
 Do not be dense . The party . <eos>
 I s not dense . And he s been here twenty minutes . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 Miss Harrington . <eos>
 What are you doing here ? <eos>
 You were just looking around . <eos>
 That s all . <eos>
 What for ? <eos>
 You probably wo not believe me . <eos>
 Probably not . <eos>
 It was for my report . <eos>
 I might . <eos>
 The maid will fix it in the morning . <eos>
 I will just pick up the broken glass . <eos>
 How would you get all the way up here from Brooklyn ? <eos>
 Subway . <eos>

 That s the door . <eos>
 So there you are . It seemed odd suddenly your not being there . <eos>
 I hope you do not mind my speaking to you . <eos>
 Bill Sampson ? He s he s a director . <eos>
 I am going to take you to Margo . <eos>
 Oh no . <eos>

 Good night Eve . I hope I see you again soon <eos>
 I will be at the old stand tomorrow matinee <eos>
 Not just that way . As a friend . <eos>
 Hollywood . <eos>
 Mrs . Richards . <eos>
 Do you think Miss Channing would approve ? <eos>
 I think she would cheer . <eos>
 But Mr . Richards and Mr . Sampson <eos>
 Then would you talk to Mr . Fabian about it ? <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 You wo not forget it ? <eos>
 I wo not forget . <eos>
 You must not mind Margo too much even if I do . <eos>
 May I have your coat ? <eos>
 Do not bother I can take it up myself . <eos>
 Eve . I have heard the most wonderful things about your performance <eos>
 We are having lunch with a movie talent scout . <eos>
 They certainly do not waste much time . <eos>
 I do not expect you to be pleasant . <eos>
 I do not intend to be . <eos>
 There can not be very much <eos>
 Oh but there is <eos>
 and easy or not I wo not believe a word . <eos>
 Eve . do not cry . <eos>
 But the raves about your performance <eos>
 He s not my friend . You were my friends . <eos>
 I think I know . <eos>
 It could have been fifteen years ago . It s my part now . <eos>
 Addison wants me to play it . <eos>
 Congratulations Eve . <eos>
 Hello Miss Harrington . <eos>
 No thank you . Yes . I have seen every performance . <eos>
 Every performance ? Then am I safe in assuming you like it ? <eos>
 Well . it started with the play before this one . <eos>
 It s been a real pleasure Eve . <eos>
 There are other plays . <eos>
 Well if I am not in the way . <eos>
 You have not noticed my latest bit of interior decorating . <eos>
 Well you have done so much . what s new ? <eos>
 The curtains . I made them myself . <eos>
 Well what do you think of my elegant new suit ? <eos>
 There s the script to go back to the Guild <eos>

 Oh golly . And I forgot to tell you <eos>
 If you would like . <eos>
 Good evening Mr . deWitt . <eos>

 Harrington . <eos>
 How much time have we ? <eos>
 Roughly ten minutes . <eos>
 How far to the station ? <eos>
 Three or four miles . <eos>
 Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas ? <eos>
 None in sight there are not many along this back road . <eos>
 He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical <eos>
 Do you want it on ? <eos>
 It does not matter . <eos>
 Karen . I have not been pleasant this weekend . <eos>
 What about Bill ? <eos>
 What about Bill ? <eos>
 Not to you . Not to Bill . <eos>
 About Eve . I have acted pretty disgracefully toward her too . <eos>
 About what ? <eos>
 With tears ? <eos>
 Check . <eos>
 I remember . <eos>
 How was the concert ? <eos>
 Coming ? <eos>
 Margo again . <eos>
 And again and again ! Two hours late for the audition to begin with <eos>
 That s on time for Margo . <eos>
 Then a childish heavy handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy <eos>
 It s going to be a cozy weekend . <eos>
 Lloyd be careful . <eos>
 Where would you get all that information ? <eos>
 Eve . <eos>
 I am beginning to catch up . <eos>
 You have got to admit it would be a novelty . <eos>
 Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello . <eos>
 No I got the idea myself while she was talking to me . <eos>
 Now just a minute ! <eos>
 I am glad Bill s back . <eos>
 Well of all <eos>
 After all maybe she just wants to apologize . <eos>
 well ? What happened ? <eos>
 What s so funny ? <eos>
 Who s it ? What s it all about ? <eos>
 Would you really ? How sweet <eos>
 I like that girl . That quality of quiet graciousness . <eos>
 Where s she ? <eos>
 You disapprove of me when I am like this do not you ? <eos>
 Not exactly . Sometimes though I wish I understood you better . <eos>
 When you do let me in on it . <eos>
 How s the new one coming ? <eos>
 The play ? All right I guess . <eos>
 Cora . She s still a girl of twenty ? <eos>
 Twentyish . It s not important . <eos>
 Do not you think it s about time it became important ? <eos>
 How do you mean ? <eos>
 Do not be evasive . <eos>
 Margo you have not got any age . <eos>
 Miss Channing s ageless . Spoken like a press agent . <eos>
 She s your understudy . <eos>
 Eve ? Eve my understudy ? But I had no idea . <eos>
 You would have been proud of her . <eos>
 I am sure . <eos>
 She was a revelation . <eos>
 To you too ? <eos>
 You have been talking to that venomous fishwife Addison deWitt <eos>
 Karen and I just do not want an accident <eos>
 I have no intention of having an accident ! <eos>
 The audience will want its money refunded believe me . <eos>
 . and Bill . Especially Bill . Eve did that too . <eos>
 You know she probably means well after all . <eos>
 That depends . <eos>
 I mean really deeply angry . <eos>
 I do not think I could be . <eos>

 Are you threatening me with legal action Mr . Fabian ? <eos>
 Are you breaking the contract ? <eos>
 Answer my question ! <eos>
 Who am I to threaten ? I am a dying man . <eos>
 I did not hear you . <eos>
 I said I am a dying man ! <eos>
 What the hell were you doing rewriting my story <eos>
 I sure could not hurt it could I ? <eos>
 it was fine the way it was <eos>

 I am smart enough to know my story was solid <eos>
 mine s better <eos>
 no way <eos>
 What s it about my writing that s so rotten ? <eos>
 Carl ? <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 It s OK I am sorry I called you a failure . <eos>
 Forget it the main thing did you call me a failure ? <eos>
 All right what do we know ? <eos>
 Hey ? <eos>

 Hunt does not seem like your ordinary consultant . <eos>
 Maybe a political operative of some sort <eos>

 That was fun . What now ? <eos>
 I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Goddamnit <eos>

 Christ and I even know somebody at the phone company <eos>
 And ? And ? <eos>

 Who s first ? <eos>
 I do not get it . this really was my turf . <eos>
 This s terrific work if you like rejection . <eos>
 Facts or theory ? <eos>
 We never reveal our sources which s why you can talk to us . <eos>
 I hate both parties . <eos>
 Republican ? <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 Who would you vote for ? <eos>
 When ? <eos>
 68 . <eos>
 Did he just say what I think he said ? <eos>
 Then tomorrow s grand jury indictments will just be bullshit . <eos>
 It goes very high we have got to find out where <eos>

 You want me to be the bastard . <eos>

 He will give us a sworn statement . <eos>
 That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats five guys had control <eos>
 I think that s him . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 Nah . Maybe . <eos>
 What if I went up and introduced myself think he would slug me ? <eos>
 Well we are trying to ruin his life . <eos>
 It s nothing personal though . <eos>
 I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun . <eos>
 Jesus <eos>

 I do not know what they would do to me . <eos>
 You have really got to go . <eos>
 . No . never in so many words . <eos>
 There are too many people watching me they know I know a lot <eos>
 Which people ? <eos>
 The ones who could disburse the money . <eos>
 So tell me about the Times article . <eos>
 What do you want to know ? <eos>
 Something maybe big . <eos>
 And that makes anything you do OK s that it ? <eos>
 then again maybe things are even worse than we have written <eos>
 Do you think the truth will come out at the trial ? <eos>
 That s another of the things I am not so sure of . <eos>

 You better win a hand you are on a blitz . <eos>
 Was he really upset when you told him ? <eos>
 I am sure that s the explanation . <eos>
 You really think so ? <eos>
 No doubt about it . <eos>
 Can I have that pad and the pencil ? <eos>
 What for ? <eos>
 I am going to write a letter to Mrs . Sheldrake . <eos>
 You are ? <eos>
 As one woman to another I am sure she will understand <eos>
 I do not like myself very much anyway . <eos>
 Pick up your cards and let s go . <eos>
 Do I have to ? <eos>
 You sure you want to throw that card ? <eos>
 Sure . <eos>
 Who was that ? <eos>

 Who would care ? <eos>
 I would . <eos>
 There s a call for you <eos>
 For me ? <eos>

 I was just different . <eos>
 They did not give you a choice did they ? <eos>
 No they did not . <eos>
 But you knew what they were training you for ? <eos>
 Of course . I was going to be James Bond . <eos>
 The exotic women . <eos>
 Women ? No . not really . <eos>

 Yes . <eos>
 Are you attracted to me ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Why ? I do not know . <eos>
 Is it a physical thing or a mental thing ? <eos>
 Is that why you did not want to talk about women before ? <eos>
 I did not want to complicate the situation . <eos>
 Attraction s a complication ? <eos>
 It can be . <eos>
 It happened to you before ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>

 Is this becoming complicated ? <eos>
 Were you attracted to me right away ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 When did it start ? <eos>
 Honestly ? <eos>

 This play means a lot to me . <eos>
 This play ? <eos>

 The world of the dead ? <eos>

 But there are thousands of them made of floating ice <eos>
 Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart . <eos>
 Looking for intelligent life ? <eos>
 Do you believe you will see your mother again ? <eos>
 I am building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley s Comet <eos>
 You are really into God right ? <eos>
 In ten words or less ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 My relationship with God s my own . <eos>
 But you think about Him It Her . <eos>
 Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do ? <eos>
 You have to believe to have faith . <eos>
 Interpreted by another guy like my father . <eos>
 He does not trust you . <eos>
 The play s going to be really good . <eos>
 You are not in a very good mood . <eos>
 The play s in a couple of weeks . <eos>

 So it s like you want to be secret friends . <eos>
 That s it ! Exactly ! You are reading my mind <eos>
 He okay ? <eos>
 You were great the other night . <eos>
 I have not been nice to you . <eos>
 People can see . <eos>
 Maybe you inspire me . <eos>
 All of it . <eos>
 It s not . <eos>
 Okay . Maybe some of that s true <eos>
 You do not know the first thing about being someone s friend <eos>
 I do not want to be just your friend <eos>
 It s a start . <eos>
 So you are talking to me ? <eos>
 What does that mean ? <eos>
 Hey . <eos>
 She great or what ? <eos>
 Why are you doing all this ? To impress me ? <eos>
 Like fire . <eos>

 Before we do this . <eos>
 Excuse me ? <eos>

 Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him . <eos>
 How did you feel when he died ? <eos>
 I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game . <eos>

 No . <eos>
 Because you did not love him <eos>

 You should not play this game . <eos>
 You are in over your head . <eos>
 Did you like her to watch ? <eos>
 Do you think I told her to kill You ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 It s OK . It s OK . <eos>
 I thought you did not do adolescent secrets . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 No ? <eos>
 You wo not believe me . <eos>

 But of course you are . <eos>
 I was wondering if you are not doing anything tonight . <eos>
 Hey Captain God ! <eos>

 You turned around ! <eos>
 Yes you shouted the words Captain God at me for no reason . <eos>
 Oh do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you ? <eos>
 Did you try to kill . <eos>

 You can not figure me out . You are the strange one . <eos>
 You are . <eos>
 We have to do something . What can we do to help Selina ? <eos>
 I am sorry ma am there are no pets allowed in the library . <eos>
 You are late . <eos>
 Mom ? Oh Mom I messed up . <eos>
 Mom not now ! I I do not know what to do . <eos>
 I do not know if I can do it alone . <eos>
 Nice breasts . <eos>
 Where do you think you are going ? <eos>
 Any place . <eos>
 This s one way . <eos>
 I know . But it s an emergency . Somebody dying . Okay ? <eos>
 I do not see anybody in there but you . <eos>
 Was someone in an accident ? <eos>
 What are you doing on Theo s line ? <eos>
 Be careful . There were people in that crosswalk . <eos>
 Have you got to tell her your life story ? <eos>
 What if they do question the authenticity ? <eos>
 Oh . Seems yours girlfriend s casting doubts on your expertise . <eos>
 Who s on the phone ? <eos>
 What was that for ? <eos>
 I did not hurt you . <eos>
 She can not ! It s busted . Now hand that on back ! <eos>
 Theo wants to talk again . <eos>
 Will you two cut it out ? <eos>
 I know you feel awful but it s not your responsibility . <eos>
 Then whose s it ? <eos>
 Are you guys all right ? <eos>
 What would you do ? Tail me from Brentwood ? <eos>
 Let s have your license mister . <eos>
 Nels reporting in . Sit down where you are . Arms folded . <eos>
 You missed . <eos>
 How do we get back to the freeway ? <eos>
 Can you make him stop ! <eos>
 It took you long enough to get my ass out . <eos>
 With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you would not suffocate . <eos>
 Now turn around . I am going to cuff you . <eos>
 Put those away . We can not have marks on his wrists . <eos>
 You switched license plates ? <eos>
 Bullshit . <eos>
 Just hand up on the bitch ! Fuck you madam . And goodbye ! <eos>
 I do not like anybody laying their hands on me . <eos>
 Just like they say no fucking self control . <eos>
 If you know that just back off . <eos>
 Shit . There s the hotel . You overshot the driveway . <eos>
 And stop with the directions . <eos>
 Got your badge ? <eos>
 Satisfied Wiseass ? <eos>
 In any event whatever occurs you do not belt anybody . <eos>
 I thought you said you could handle him . <eos>
 Nels do not let that cop pass you . <eos>
 Lose the hardware now . <eos>
 Do not fuck around . Pop a cap in him . <eos>
 He took it like a man . Toss him in that drainage ditch . <eos>
 Any minute . <eos>
 Do I know you ? <eos>
 I have been trying to get someone anyone . For hours . <eos>
 If this s some sales pitch I am not buying <eos>
 Will you let me explain ! <eos>
 And what are you whispering for ? <eos>
 Who smashed the phone ? <eos>
 They are holding my husband downstairs . <eos>
 I do not believe you . <eos>
 You are the one who s not to be believed . <eos>
 My name s <eos>
 I do not want to know <eos>
 My name s Lenore Oberfeld . <eos>
 Do not expect me to tell you who I am . <eos>
 You wo not disconnect . <eos>
 Oh wo not I ? <eos>
 Because you know you will be killing us . <eos>
 Do not lay this on me ! <eos>
 Well s not there a number on the goddam phone ? <eos>
 The cops could trace this call back to you . <eos>
 One of them u is u a cop . <eos>
 Oh man . These people mean business . <eos>
 I am in traffic . There s no place to turn . <eos>
 Please . <eos>
 What do they need her for ? <eos>
 Let me call the school tell them not to let her go . <eos>
 Theo ? <eos>
 Forget who I am . Where s this school located ? <eos>
 26th off Wilshire . <eos>
 Even if I got there first she would not go with me . <eos>
 Why s not anyone answering me ? <eos>
 Will you please speak to me ! Theo ? <eos>
 Hello ? It s just me and you again . <eos>
 What about the others ? <eos>
 I kind of dropped them off . They were getting on my nerves . <eos>
 Forget about us . Just save Rachel . <eos>
 Where s the fucking recharger cord ? Must be in her car dammit . <eos>
 How much time do you have left on it ? <eos>
 A woman ? <eos>
 Hey drop it okay ? <eos>
 I am sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal . <eos>
 What do you do for a living ? <eos>
 Sometimes I paint . <eos>
 Our house always needs touching up . <eos>
 Pictures . <eos>
 I did not mean to insult you . You are an artist . <eos>
 I suppose if you are a struggling artist you need a patron . <eos>
 I did not mean to . It s just the way I am . <eos>
 A price on everything . <eos>
 I was not always like that . I do not think I was . <eos>
 That makes two of us . <eos>
 Make a right . You can not miss it . <eos>
 Lenore I am here . I am getting out . <eos>
 Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail ? <eos>
 Does she wear glasses ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 What s happening ? <eos>
 She s gone <eos>
 Do not say anything . Do not alarm them . Just go ! <eos>
 It s not your fault Theo . You tried . <eos>
 You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box ? <eos>
 The one in Brentwood . <eos>
 What bank ? <eos>
 Wait just a minute . Our luck has changed . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 Not a chance . <eos>
 Do not say that . <eos>
 They have still got to be able to sign his name . <eos>
 It s not hard to do . I do it all the time . <eos>
 You are doing what you can . Why s all this money stashed ? <eos>
 To hide it from the I . R . S . <eos>
 How come everybody turns out to be a crook ? <eos>
 Do not talk . Do not talk ! <eos>
 Yeah sure that s me . Ask anybody . <eos>
 Why tell me this ? <eos>
 Because you are probably the last person I will ever talk to . <eos>
 Did you jiggle the phone ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Did you hear that click ? <eos>
 Yes I think so . Another crossed line ? <eos>
 Or somebody else there s listening in <eos>
 They dragged me downstairs . I thought they were going to kill me . <eos>
 Lucky for them they did not . <eos>
 Thank you . God bless you for helping us . <eos>
 Are you okay ? <eos>
 They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles . <eos>
 You are all three of you in that van ? <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 I can not do it . <eos>
 Do not start thinking about it . Is the tape off ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Can you walk ? <eos>
 Rachel Oh my God . <eos>
 It s locked . <eos>
 She will never be the same . None of us will . <eos>
 Now I have it s a long story . <eos>
 So far they are keeping their part of it . <eos>
 He had a gun . I have it now . <eos>
 You are not Lenore Oberfeld . <eos>
 There s not any such person . <eos>
 The guy with the transplant . <eos>
 Jack Oberfeld in person . Did you kill him ? <eos>
 At least one . <eos>
 Plus they will remember you going after his daughter at school . <eos>
 You timed that beautifully . <eos>
 As they say no good deed goes unpunished . <eos>
 And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop <eos>
 I thought it was inspired . <eos>
 Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel until they get here . <eos>
 Why pick me to be your mark ? <eos>
 Nobody s easier to con than a con man . <eos>
 Who s in back ? <eos>
 L . A . P . D . <eos>
 A typical fuck up . <eos>
 You were at the Emerald that night ? <eos>
 Naturally you did not learn your lesson . <eos>
 Now you are starting to sound like a victim again . <eos>
 What s Nels number ? <eos>
 259 7881 . <eos>
 Do you think they will walk away ? <eos>
 They will have units blocking us up ahead . <eos>
 That s why we are turning off onto a fire road . <eos>
 Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed . <eos>
 Yeah I was waiting for that suggestion . <eos>
 Sooner or later you will learn to trust me . <eos>
 What s really on your wicked little mind ? <eos>
 The cop in the trunk he could still be alive . <eos>
 That s a reasonable possibility . <eos>
 He might have heard everything we said in the car . <eos>
 What s your point ? <eos>
 We can not leave him to repeat anything . <eos>
 Which one of us s elected to do the deed ? <eos>
 You are the man with the gun . <eos>
 Naturally . <eos>
 Naturally . <eos>
 Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us . <eos>
 That s not good enough . <eos>
 I am handling it . <eos>
 Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me . <eos>
 Took preparation . <eos>
 Know what else s in here ? <eos>
 You wo not live to see it . <eos>
 It s going to be some fucking snowstorm . <eos>
 I have got . one last number for you Theo . <eos>
 Sure like I am gonna take advice from you . <eos>
 Thank God thank God I have got you . <eos>
 Who s this ? <eos>
 Oh God Oh no Help me Do not let me Die . <eos>
 Twenty percent . <eos>
 Fine . I want half . Plus the release of the family . <eos>
 They saw you kill the driver . <eos>
 Where do we meet ? <eos>
 It s a nice day . How about the beach ? <eos>
 What time frame have you got in mind ? <eos>
 It should take me twenty minutes . Where are you coming from ? <eos>
 Some loyalty . <eos>
 Got a phone in that van ? <eos>
 308 9962 . <eos>
 Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot . <eos>
 You are getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular . <eos>
 I am here . Where are you ? <eos>
 It s your call . <eos>
 Fucking A it is ! Any argument and I am out of here . <eos>
 Just relax . <eos>
 I do not need to relax . The woman . Put her on . <eos>
 I do not know what you mean . <eos>
 Negative . <eos>
 You will still have the girl and the husband . <eos>
 And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van . <eos>
 Stop the crying . <eos>
 She s yours . What are we waiting on ? <eos>
 Count it . <eos>
 Seems like it . <eos>
 What s he doing ? Answer me ! <eos>
 Who am I talking to ? <eos>
 If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 Nels ! Guess who ? A friendly voice from beyond the grave . <eos>
 Who s this ? <eos>
 I thought you would know me by now . <eos>
 What does it take to kill you ? <eos>
 I suppose you are in your taxi ? <eos>
 That bitch . What s keeping you from taking off ? <eos>
 I can see the benefit in that . <eos>
 In the hills above Sunset . Just below the Getty . <eos>
 How far off are you ? <eos>
 Five minutes . <eos>
 And make ourselves a hell of a target . <eos>
 We are gonna get there first . <eos>
 How do you know ? <eos>
 Better haul ass if we are gonna be inside to greet them . <eos>
 I have got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards . <eos>
 Somebody better tear this down before it falls down . <eos>
 Who were you talking to ? <eos>
 Since when did you guys start changing tires ? <eos>
 Only you u do not u have a flat . <eos>
 Seems not . <eos>
 If you were not going for a spare what were you doing ? <eos>
 Something was rattling around . Some loose tools . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 Let me talk to the lady again . <eos>
 I already called for an ambulance . <eos>
 You have got a u phone u ? <eos>
 Can I make a quick call ? <eos>
 Government business ? <eos>
 What kind of Treasury Dept . business s this ? <eos>
 Undercover . <eos>
 The 405 s coming up . <eos>
 You sure know how to take a lot of punishment . <eos>
 Scottish ? <eos>
 So can we consider you a regular sir ? <eos>
 Is that good or bad ? <eos>
 So let s call this the usual . <eos>
 It takes all types . <eos>
 So who s he ? <eos>
 He s what she should run a mile from . <eos>
 Then why does not she ? <eos>
 She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself . <eos>
 You could always make it up to her . <eos>
 How ? <eos>
 When a girl runs out like that she generally wants to be followed . <eos>
 She s not a girl Col <eos>
 See that Col ? <eos>
 See what Dil ? <eos>
 He gave me a look . <eos>
 Just cut his hair you know . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 What you think ? <eos>
 Saw that one . <eos>

 Now he can look . Ask him does he like his hair Col . <eos>
 He agreed that he was . <eos>
 What do you think his name is ? <eos>
 That s what he said . Jimmy . <eos>
 He s still looking Col . <eos>
 Persistent . <eos>
 Good thing in a man . <eos>
 An excellent quality . <eos>
 Maybe he wants something . <eos>

 He s brains without ambition . <eos>
 . sensitivity without neurosis . He s . <eos>
 . the master of his realm . <eos>
 How can we ever hope to win against the trout ? <eos>
 There s only one way you can do it Mason . <eos>
 Turn the power of the hunter against him . <eos>
 . back . <eos>
 . and that power . <eos>
 . without caution . <eos>
 . is death . <eos>
 Some people might say you are readin an awful lot in . <eos>
 . to a simple thing like . <eos>

  <eos>
 Mason . <eos>
 Shit ! Oh shit . <eos>
 Call an ambulance . <eos>
 The compound has to be kept cold . <eos>

 Never let it reach fifty degre degrees . <eos>
 And what if it does ? <eos>
 You are the only one I can trust . <eos>
 The only one who understands what this me . <eos>

 Seven months . <eos>
 Chick s nuts about you . How long did you date Caitlin ? <eos>
 Five years . <eos>
 Chick only made you nuts . She cheated on you how many times ? <eos>
 Eight and a half . <eos>
 That s cheating ? <eos>
 In the middle of it she calls me Brad . <eos>
 She called you Brad ? <eos>
 Oh my God . <eos>
 Great story s not it ? <eos>
 Your mother . <eos>
 Allan Harris . <eos>
 Chess team Allan Harris ? <eos>
 The two moved to Idaho together after graduation . They raise sheep . <eos>
 That s frightening . <eos>
 Because there was a lot of good in our relationship . <eos>
 Oh shit I have got to place an order . <eos>
 I am talking to myself here . <eos>
 Caitlin s on the same wave length ? <eos>
 All four ? <eos>
 Do you know that article s accurate ? Caitlin s really getting married ! <eos>
 You know what I just watched ? <eos>
 Me pulling a can off some moron s fist . <eos>
 Return of the Jedi . <eos>
 Did not you hear me ? Caitlin really s getting married . <eos>
 Which did you like better Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back . <eos>
 Empire . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 All right Vader s boss . <eos>
 You know what else I noticed in Jedi ? <eos>
 There s more ? <eos>
 So they build another Death Star right ? <eos>
 Luke blew it up . Give credit where it s due . <eos>
 And the second one was still being built when they blew it up . <eos>
 Basically . <eos>
 So when they blew it up no prob . Evil s punished . <eos>
 You will never believe what this unruly customer just said . <eos>
 Wait . <eos>
 She s in here ? <eos>
 What s he looking for ? <eos>
 He said he has to find a perfect dozen . <eos>
 Perfect dozen . <eos>
 Each egg has to be perfect . <eos>
 Why does not he just mix and match ? <eos>
 You know how much money the average jizz mopper make per hour ? <eos>
 Nudie booth ? <eos>
 Nudie booth . You have never been in a nudie booth ? <eos>
 It s not really anyone per se it s more of separate groupings . <eos>
 Let s hear it . <eos>
 The milkmaids . <eos>
 Which ones ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Can you come next door ? I gotta make a phone call . <eos>
 Smokey Three thumbs up am I right ? <eos>
 Vermont ? <eos>
 Can you believe this ? <eos>
 He did not mention it when he called you this morning ? <eos>
 Not a fucking word ! Slippery shit ! <eos>
 So what you are stuck here all day ? <eos>
 FUCK ! <eos>
 Why would you apologize ? <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 That seems to be the leitmotif in your life ever backing down . <eos>
 You know what pisses me off the most ? <eos>
 The fact that I am right about your buckling ? <eos>
 I am going to miss the game . <eos>
 Do not yell at me pal . <eos>
 Sorry . <eos>
 See ? There you go again . <eos>
 I can not believe I am going to miss the game ! <eos>
 At least we are stuck here together . <eos>
 No argument here . Insubordination rules . <eos>
 He s blunt but he s got a point . <eos>
 Design major . <eos>
 Are you gonna lock the store ? <eos>
 We are not playing in the street . <eos>
 Bitch bitch bitch . You want something to drink ? <eos>
 What happened to all the Gatorade ? <eos>
 Exactly . They drank it all . <eos>
 After an exhausting game like that I can believe it . <eos>
 You know what Sanford told me ? <eos>
 I still can not believe Caitlin s getting married . <eos>
 Julie Dwyer died . <eos>
 Yeah right . <eos>
 Oh my god . <eos>
 Sanford s brother dates her cousin . He found out this morning . <eos>
 How ? When ? <eos>
 Embolism in her brain . Yesterday . <eos>
 Number six . <eos>
 You have had sex with a dead person . <eos>
 I am gonna go to her wake . <eos>
 No you are not . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 It s today . <eos>
 What ! <eos>
 Paulsen s Funeral Parlor . The next show s at four . <eos>
 Shit . What about tomorrow ? <eos>
 One night only . She s buried in the morning . <eos>
 You hate people . <eos>
 But I love gatherings . Is not it ironic ? <eos>
 Do not be an asshole . Somebody has to stay with the store . <eos>
 If you go I go . <eos>
 She meant nothing to you ! <eos>
 She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died . <eos>
 I am not taking you to this funeral . <eos>
 I am going with you . <eos>
 I can not close the store . <eos>
 She was pretty young hunhh ? <eos>
 Twenty two same as us . <eos>
 An embolism in a pool . <eos>
 An embarrassing way to die . <eos>
 That s nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died . <eos>
 How would he die ? <eos>
 Broke his neck . <eos>
 That s embarrassing ? <eos>
 Shut the hell up . <eos>
 Bible truth . <eos>
 Stop it . <eos>
 I swear . <eos>
 Oh my god . <eos>
 Come on . Have not you ever tried to suck your own dick ? <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Yeah sure . You are so repressed . <eos>
 His dick was in his mouth ? <eos>
 Balls resting on his lips . <eos>
 He made it hunhh ? <eos>
 I could never reach . <eos>
 Reach what ? <eos>
 You know . <eos>
 I know it was a bad idea to close the store . <eos>
 I can not fucking believe you ! <eos>
 I am telling you it was not my fault ! <eos>
 You knocked the fucking casket over for Chrissakes ! <eos>
 I was just leaning on it ! It was an accident ! <eos>
 Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose ? <eos>
 So the casket fell over ! Big deal ! <eos>
 Let me borrow your car . <eos>
 I do not want to talk to you . <eos>
 Fine . Just lend me your car . <eos>
 Why should I loan you my car ? <eos>
 I want to rent a movie . <eos>
 What s that for ? <eos>
 Let me borrow your car . <eos>
 May I be blunt with you ? <eos>
 So your argument s that title dictates behavior ? <eos>
 Jesus ! <eos>
 And two to make a point title does not dictate behavior . <eos>
 You are a danger to both the dead and the living . <eos>
 I like to think I am a master of my own destiny . <eos>
 Please get the hell out of here . <eos>
 Get to work . <eos>
 And this s what you rented ? <eos>
 I like to expand my horizons . <eos>
 I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor . <eos>
 No way ! <eos>
 Five hundred dollars . <eos>
 I did not think they even enforced this . <eos>
 Living proof . <eos>
 I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids . <eos>
 I do not you did . <eos>
 Really ? <eos>
 Little girl . Maybe five years old ? <eos>
 Then how come you got the fine ? <eos>
 Because I am here . <eos>
 You are lying . <eos>
 I swear . I could not make this kind of hell up . <eos>
 Then why are not you like screaming at me right now ? <eos>
 Because I am happy . <eos>
 You are happy ? <eos>
 I am happy . <eos>
 You are happy to get a fine ? <eos>
 No . I am happy because Caitlin came to see me . <eos>
 Now I know you are lying . <eos>
 I am not . She just left . <eos>
 You are kidding . <eos>
 I am not . <eos>
 Wow . You have had quite an evening . <eos>
 She went home she s getting ready and we are going out . <eos>
 I feel so ineffectual . Is there anything I can do for you ? <eos>
 Watch the store while I go home and change . <eos>
 What happened to title dictates behavior ? <eos>
 This s my way of spitting water at life . <eos>
 You are a snake . <eos>
 All right but you are missing out . Chicks with dicks . <eos>
 Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium ? <eos>
 You just fucked a total stranger ? <eos>
 Around three or something . <eos>
 What time did we go to the funeral ? <eos>
 This life . <eos>
 This life ? <eos>
 Why do I have this life ? <eos>
 That s all bullshit . You know what the real problem here is ? <eos>
 You should shit or get off the pot . <eos>
 I should shit or get off the pot . <eos>
 Yeah you should shit or get off the pot . <eos>
 Thank you . Why do not you go back to the video store ? <eos>
 It s the same thing with Veronica . <eos>
 Caitlin and I can not be together . It s impossible . <eos>
 Who are you kidding ? You can so . <eos>
 I thought I was doing you a favor . <eos>
 You still did not have to choke me . <eos>
 Oh please ! I am surprised I did not kill you . <eos>
 Why do you say that ? <eos>
 Why do I say that ? Randal . forget it . <eos>
 How do you figure ? <eos>
 What time did you get to work today ? <eos>
 To talk to you . <eos>
 Which means the video store s ostensibly closed . <eos>
 It s not like I am miles away . <eos>
 Unless you are out renting videos at other video stores . <eos>
 I threw out the stuff that got broken . The floor looks clean . <eos>
 You need a ride ? <eos>
 Do you work tomorrow ? <eos>
 Helluva day . <eos>
 Get the fuck outta here already . <eos>
 Are you open ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Just the paper . <eos>
 I would say about sixty seventy tops . <eos>
 He s got those love handles . <eos>
 Do I know you ? <eos>
 You remember Alyssa Jones ? She hung out with . <eos>
 Caitlin Bree . Yeah ? <eos>
 I am her sister . <eos>
 You know him ? <eos>
 Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym . <eos>
 They are not . <eos>
 Yes they are . You are out of shape . <eos>
 What are you talking about ? There s no fat on this body . <eos>
 I am not . <eos>
 How much can you bench ? <eos>
 Did you say Caitlin Bree ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Pretty girl about this girl s height dark hair gorgeous body ? <eos>
 How do you know that ? <eos>
 Oh man ! Hey you still going out with her ? <eos>
 No she s getting married . <eos>
 All the time . That girl was like a rabbit . <eos>
 Are there any balls down there ? <eos>
 Go open the video store . <eos>
 Yeah you cock smoking clerk . <eos>
 How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store . <eos>
 One seventy nine . <eos>
 Pay the good man . Do not you close soon ? <eos>
 It s not my store . <eos>
 And these are not my drugs I just sell them . <eos>
 The difference s you exploit a weakness . <eos>
 What s that mean ? <eos>
 You sell to people that can not stay away from an addiction . <eos>
 All right . How much s Pepsi here ? <eos>
 A dollar sixty nine plus tax . <eos>
 At Food City it s ninety nine cents plus tax . <eos>
 I can not believe you just rolled a joint in here . <eos>
 Hey man what happened with that old guy ? <eos>
 He died in the bathroom . <eos>
 That s fucked up . Yo I heard he was jerkin off . <eos>
 Knock it off . That used to be my girlfriend . <eos>
 You used to go out with her ? <eos>
 We were going to start again I think . <eos>
 Do not you already have a girlfriend ? <eos>
 Lasagne . <eos>
 And what you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick ? <eos>
 Damn . She sure goes out of her way . <eos>
 I am sure he was not sleeping . <eos>
 You calling me a liar ? <eos>
 Be careful . <eos>
 And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass . <eos>
 No he got hit by a bus . <eos>
 Oh . Can I help you ? <eos>
 Well that depends . Do you have a bathroom ? <eos>
 Uh . sure . Go ahead . It s back through the cooler . <eos>
 Thanks son . Say what kind of toilet paper you got back there ? <eos>
 Yeah okay . Go ahead . <eos>
 Jesus . go ahead . <eos>
 Can I trouble you for one of those magazines ? <eos>
 I said go ahead . <eos>
 At least they were not lit . <eos>
 I hate this fucking place . <eos>
 Then quit . You should be going to school anyway . <eos>
 Please Veronica . Last thing I need s a lecture at this point . <eos>
 All I am saying s that if you are unhappy you should leave . <eos>
 The guy got sick and could not come in . <eos>
 Why do not you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here ? <eos>
 Somebody jammed the locks with gum . <eos>
 You are kidding . <eos>
 Bunch of savages in this town . <eos>
 You look bushed . What time did you get to bed ? <eos>
 I do not know like two thirty three . <eos>
 What were you doing up so late ? <eos>
 Hunhh ? Nothing . <eos>
 What were you doing ? <eos>
 Nothing ! Jesus ! I gotta fight with you now ? <eos>
 What ? What s that ? <eos>
 You are trusting . <eos>
 Do you think anyone can see us down here ? <eos>
 Why ? You wanna have sex or something ? <eos>
 Ooh ! Can we ? <eos>
 Really ? <eos>
 I was kidding . <eos>
 Yeah right . You can not get enough of me . <eos>
 Typically male point of view . <eos>
 How flattering . <eos>
 Now making a woman cum . therein lies a challenge . <eos>
 And I actually date you ? <eos>
 I touched a nerve . <eos>
 I am astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life . <eos>
 It was not directed at you . I was making a broad generalization . <eos>
 How many ? <eos>
 How many what ? <eos>
 How many girls have you slept with ? <eos>
 How many different girls ? Did not we already have this discussion once ? <eos>
 We might have I do not remember . How many ? <eos>
 Including you ? <eos>
 It better be up to and including me . <eos>
 Twelve . <eos>
 You have slept with twelve different girls ? <eos>
 What the hell was that for ? <eos>
 You are a pig . <eos>
 Why would you hit me ? <eos>
 Do you know how many different men I have had sex with ? <eos>
 Do I get to hit you after you tell me ? <eos>
 Three . <eos>
 Three ? <eos>
 Three including you . <eos>
 You have only had sex with three different people ? <eos>
 I am not the pig you are . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 You ! <eos>
 No who were the three besides me ? <eos>
 John Franson and Rob Stanslyk . <eos>
 Animal vegetable or mineral . <eos>
 Vegetable meaning paraplegic . <eos>
 They put up the least amount of struggle . <eos>
 After dropping a bombshell like that you owe me . Big . <eos>
 All right . Name it . <eos>
 I want you to come with me on Monday . <eos>
 Shit ! Why are we getting up ? <eos>
 Why do you call him that ? <eos>
 Sylvan made it up . It s a blow job thing . <eos>
 He requested this ? <eos>
 He gets off on it . <eos>
 Sylvan can be talked into anything . <eos>
 Why do you say that ? <eos>
 Like you said she snowballed him . <eos>
 Sylvan ? No I snowballed him . <eos>

 Really ? You are the best . <eos>
 You had to tell him . <eos>
 I had to tell someone . He put it into perspective . <eos>
 What did he say ? <eos>
 At least he was not thirty six . <eos>

 Who ever said sanity was fun ? <eos>
 It does not matter . It will work out . <eos>
 Promise ? <eos>
 Promise . As long as we have steak . <eos>
 The store was busy . <eos>
 You got wine . That s great . <eos>
 Would you mind if we just called it an early night ? <eos>
 You go ahead and relax . I will cook . <eos>

 Are you OK ? <eos>
 Four interviews . Four no gos . <eos>

 You are going to miss the Top Ten . <eos>
 Hey Letty . Mrs . Mayer . <eos>

 Something like that . <eos>
 When he could get time off from the restaurant business . <eos>

 I guess we need to talk . <eos>
 I guess so . <eos>
 I sure know what that feels like . <eos>
 And all the plans we have . <eos>
 But that was not me . I did not mean to do that . <eos>
 Well then why would it happen ? <eos>
 I am sorry . I did not come here to blame you . <eos>
 What are we going to do ? <eos>
 I love you so much . <eos>
 Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach . <eos>
 Do not you have a magic trick or something to make this easier ? <eos>
 Would that really be such a good idea for either of us ? <eos>
 Just promise me you will be OK OK ? <eos>
 I guess I should go now . <eos>
 Believe me I know your feelings on the matter . <eos>
 My math program . The Superintendent said he would fund it . <eos>
 Actually I need to review the deposition questions tonight . Maybe tomorrow ? <eos>
 What are you doing ? You are going to be late . <eos>
 You do not have a fever . <eos>
 I do not feel like going to work today . <eos>
 Forget I asked . <eos>
 I am sorry . I am just . I am so tired lately . <eos>
 Maybe you ought to see a doctor . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 Can you loan me a 20 ? <eos>
 Sure . Why ? <eos>
 I am going to the store . <eos>
 It s prettier here than I thought it would be . <eos>
 Yeah I guess it s all right . <eos>
 Are you all right ? <eos>
 That s a big question . <eos>
 I hope it was not something I did . <eos>
 Of course not no . Is that why you are here ? <eos>
 I think we need to talk about some things . <eos>
 Yes I suppose so . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Especially this last year . <eos>
 Especially now . <eos>
 I know . We can not just keep going through the motions . <eos>
 No you have done a perfect job . <eos>
 No no . <eos>
 So will you ? <eos>
 What s so urgent ? You have got me worried . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I have met someone else . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 It does not matter who . <eos>
 Have you been seeing another teacher ? <eos>
 I am glad you agreed to see me . <eos>
 I am just glad there are not any hard feelings . <eos>
 Oh none . None . I completely understand what was going on . <eos>
 Oh . <eos>
 How s work going ? Are you back at school ? <eos>
 Getting back . <eos>
 I heard about your friend . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 I heard your friend was back in the hospital . <eos>
 I think I have heard this speech before . <eos>
 The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave . <eos>
 I am glad you are doing well . <eos>
 What does that mean ? <eos>
 I need someone to work on budget projections . <eos>
 Office work ? <eos>
 All tapped out . <eos>
 How s it look ? <eos>
 Shhh . They are coming to the cubic zirconium . <eos>
 I like those sapphire earrings myself . <eos>
 Agent Hadley . <eos>
 Do you know who this is ? <eos>
 Okay . Okay . I believe you . <eos>

 You did not have to kill Sophie . <eos>

 Yeah . Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse . <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 And nothing . He s just feeling us out . <eos>
 He s trying to get a foot hold in our territory . <eos>
 He sticks his toes in the water again we will cut em off . <eos>
 Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property . <eos>
 They are gonna be what ? <eos>
 Supernumerary . It means better than expected . <eos>
 Oh Frankie what s this I hear about your brother ? <eos>
 He missed three weeks . <eos>
 Your own brother ? You could not send someone else to do it ? <eos>
 I did . Joey Two Tons and Nicky The Rake did the deed . <eos>
 They knew who you were when they broke in your house ? <eos>
 Either you are incredibly brave or incredibly stupid . Which one s it ? <eos>
 I guess we are going to find out . <eos>
 You rob an associate of mine . a friend and <eos>
 I do not think it will be a mystery much longer . <eos>
 He s recorded every conversation he s had with you for years . <eos>
 And for my help I would get what ? <eos>
 Half the tapes . <eos>
 And the other half ? <eos>
 I will destroy them when we get back to Paris . <eos>
 I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Tonight ? <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito . <eos>

 Why do I always have to answer the phone ? <eos>
 Because you are the closest . <eos>
 Why s everything an argument with you ? <eos>
 Raymond grab the tapes . We are leaving ! <eos>

 We are being watched . Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks . <eos>
 Bastaldi s dead . He s fuckin dead ! <eos>
 You want Zero to kill him ? <eos>
 I am going to kill him myself ! <eos>
 Bring me the scissors . <eos>
 Turn on the flashlight . <eos>
 Do they come with batteries ? <eos>
 You did not buy batteries ? <eos>
 I thought they came with batteries . <eos>
 That s an excellent plan . Very comforting . <eos>
 You think it s smart to tell him we are French ? <eos>

 What does arresting us get them ? <eos>
 And how do we do that ? <eos>
 When do we go ? <eos>
 You ever hear of jet lag ? <eos>

 Casandra . Old girlfriend ? <eos>
 Something like that . <eos>

 Something like that . <eos>
 It looks old . Did you get it a long time ago ? <eos>
 I do not remember . I was drunk . <eos>

 Jesus Frankie I am your brother ! <eos>
 She seems pleasant enough . <eos>
 She does not know . She thinks I fell down the stairs . <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 Okay . Okay . <eos>
 You are back ! <eos>
 How s the arm ? Still sore ? <eos>
 Much better . You have been gone so long . <eos>
 Li Mu Bai s coming to stay the night . <eos>
 She s crazy . You should have killed her . <eos>
 I did not have the heart . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 I do not care about your sword . <eos>
 This Jade Fox s a woman ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Where s your master ? <eos>
 Stop talking like a monk ! Just fight ! <eos>
 Then tell me where Jade Fox is . <eos>
 On guard ! <eos>
 Why do you want to teach me ? <eos>
 I have always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan s secrets . <eos>
 Who are you ? Why s the Green Destiny in your possession ? <eos>
 I am just playing around . <eos>
 Tell me who s your master ? <eos>
 I will never live as a thief ! <eos>
 I owe you nothing . <eos>
 Hello . What s your name ? <eos>
 In that case perhaps we could be of assistance . <eos>
 Do not bother . <eos>
 You do not seem to understand . <eos>
 Are you related to Li Mu Bai ? <eos>
 Put them down . <eos>
 I heard you met Shu Lien today . <eos>
 I will socialize with whomever I please . <eos>
 It will be just the same . Enough ! I am tired . <eos>
 This spells trouble . <eos>
 You are too young to understand . <eos>
 Writers would not sell many books if they told how it really is . <eos>
 You are not married are you ? <eos>
 What do you think ? <eos>
 No ! You could not roam around freely if you were . <eos>
 I have missed you . <eos>
 How so ? <eos>
 You are doing calligraphy ? <eos>
 You write gracefully . Calligraphy s so similar to fencing . <eos>
 Do you think so ? Let me tell you a story . <eos>
 About you and Li Mu Bai ? <eos>
 Yes . Did you know I was once engaged to be married ? <eos>
 Do not distance us . From now on let s be like sisters . <eos>
 You say she killed a policeman ? <eos>
 Here you must be in proper attire . <eos>
 I am just borrowing some clean clothes . I am not staying . <eos>
 I will give them to you . <eos>
 They forced me to marry ! <eos>
 Go back to them first . Then you can decide about Lo . <eos>
 Where s he now ? <eos>
 Li Mu Bai has made arrangements . He sent him to Wudan Mountain . <eos>
 Do not touch it ! That s Li Mu Bai s sword . <eos>
 Come and get it if you can . <eos>
 Stop it ! You do not deserve the Green Destiny . <eos>
 Not another lecture ! On guard ! <eos>
 Let s end this here . <eos>
 What do you want ? <eos>
 Give it back ! <eos>
 Kneel ! <eos>
 Never ! <eos>
 Lo ? <eos>
 Let s stop a moment . <eos>
 You have got quite a temper . It s better this way . <eos>
 Not true . I can use it to pick fleas from my horse . <eos>
 Give me back my comb . <eos>
 I do not take orders from anyone . <eos>
 Let them look . <eos>
 Keep it safe . Return it to me when we are together again . <eos>
 Go . <eos>
 Jen . <eos>
 Do you remember the legend of the young man ? <eos>
 A faithful heart makes wishes come true . <eos>
 Mu Bai . It s been too long . <eos>
 It has . How s business ? <eos>
 Good . And how are you ? <eos>
 I left the training early . <eos>
 What was it ? <eos>
 Something I can not let go of . You are leaving soon ? <eos>
 We are preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking . <eos>
 The Green Destiny Sword ? You are giving it to Sir Te ? <eos>
 You use it justly you are worthy of it . <eos>
 It s time for me to leave it behind . <eos>
 Sir Te believes it s a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu . <eos>
 But something s going on at the Yu household . <eos>
 Jade Fox ? Impossible . <eos>
 You always suspected she would fled to the West . <eos>
 I did not think she would dare come back to Peking ! <eos>
 Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu ? <eos>
 Have you questioned him yet ? <eos>
 No not yet . <eos>
 What do you mean ? Did not you come back here for it ? <eos>
 I do not know it was stolen until I got here . <eos>
 Then why did you come ? <eos>
 I knew she would intrigue you . <eos>
 I wish there were something more I could do to help you . <eos>
 We are close to your headquarters . Go home and check in . <eos>
 What about you ? <eos>
 What happened ? <eos>
 Jade Fox drugged her . How did you get here ? <eos>
 Mu Bai hold on . Give me some hope . <eos>
 Shu Lien . <eos>
 Save your strength . <eos>
 But do not be too lenient . <eos>
 No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking . <eos>
 Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same . <eos>
 It s Jade Fox ! <eos>
 You are mistaken . We are just street performers . We were rehearsing . <eos>
 They are gone . <eos>
 Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword ? <eos>
 Yes though I doubt he s involved in this . <eos>
 What do you have in mind ? <eos>
 This sack of shit s called Tin Tin . <eos>
 Do not any of your little pals have real grown up names ? <eos>
 And you are gonna tell me who . <eos>
 Talent . Hi . <eos>
 Care for a hot dog ? <eos>
 You buying ? <eos>
 No onions though okay ? <eos>
 No onions ? <eos>
 Speak up . Clear it with the Captain if you need a file . <eos>
 Just do not tell me you owe me one . What file ? <eos>
 Well hello there . chocolate <eos>
 Do not thank me . <eos>
 And I say I am dead . and I move . <eos>
 You do not say . <eos>
 I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell . <eos>
 My name . <eos>
 I am sorry as hell man . <eos>
 Thank you . For giving a damn . <eos>
 Funboy had to leave this mortal coil . <eos>
 Yeah among others . Hey man you are hit . <eos>
 It s only a flesh wound . <eos>
 They could not do anything for me . <eos>
 How bout the morgue ? <eos>
 Do not interfere . <eos>
 Mom ? <eos>
 I told you you are not supposed to come in here . <eos>

 I have a question . <eos>
 Who am I ? <eos>
 Why are we speaking Chinese ? <eos>
 No you can not . <eos>
 I can not ? <eos>
 How about if I try humility . <eos>
 I do not want to waste your time . <eos>
 Then do not . <eos>
 You have a car ? <eos>
 Uh yes . <eos>
 Seems I am . <eos>
 You disappeared . <eos>
 You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely . <eos>
 Like I would have art in my suitcase . <eos>
 Of course you would not . The Rembrandt would not fit . <eos>
 I have got something . <eos>
 You are not taking me seriously . <eos>
 I did not expect you to be so . <eos>
 So what ? <eos>
 Do you mind ? <eos>
 You . you can not . <eos>
 You are shaking . Are you nervous ? <eos>
 I have got something for you . <eos>
 And I thought we were getting on so well . <eos>
 We were we are but this s perfect for you . <eos>
 For God s sake . <eos>
 The Empress Death Mask . <eos>
 I suspected it might be worthy of your interest . <eos>
 But Roki said <eos>
 You can not . <eos>
 We going somewhere ? <eos>
 Possibly . <eos>
 Maybe I should drive this time . <eos>
 Very nice . <eos>
 It s a test . <eos>
 It s a fake . <eos>
 Give him the card . <eos>
 But <eos>
 A film case . <eos>
 He says they turned the card down . <eos>
 Damn I knew I forgot something . <eos>
 What the hell was that ? <eos>
 Not bad . I did not expect you to make it out . <eos>
 Motorcycle . <eos>
 It s one way . <eos>
 We are going to die are not we . <eos>
 What about your bags ? <eos>
 Those are my clothes . <eos>
 You stole my luggage ? You <eos>
 I am a thief . Sue me . <eos>
 That s entrapment . <eos>
 I do not believe this . <eos>
 What s your problem ? I am doing the job . <eos>
 And <eos>
 I am impressed . Ca not spot a thing . <eos>
 You are late . <eos>
 And good morning . <eos>
 Good morning . <eos>
 I know it well . <eos>
 As I recall you have robbed it before . <eos>
 Years ago if memory serves . When does the exhibit end ? <eos>
 We ? Are you implying that I am taking you inside ? <eos>
 I go in alone . <eos>
 You do not have any idea how lucky you are ! <eos>
 A lifelong problem I am afraid . <eos>
 Nice try . Everyone thinks I did . <eos>
 That s because I wanted them to ! <eos>
 The Rembrandt that was quite good . <eos>
 On what ? Another job ? <eos>
 We get the Mask I will tell you . <eos>
 A partner with secrets s not much of a partner . <eos>
 So you are testing u me u now ? <eos>
 Why do not we take oxygen ? <eos>
 Let s do it again . <eos>
 Did I hear a car ? <eos>
 Our equipment has arrived . <eos>
 All this this s a woman s version of what you would like . <eos>
 I did not mean to get personal . <eos>
 So how long to pop the floor ? <eos>
 A dozen times . <eos>
 Got it . <eos>
 Charged ? <eos>
 That s it . We are ready . <eos>
 I trust it s your size . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 No no I want to . I will just go into the village . <eos>
 Certainly the most beautiful crook I have ever seen . <eos>
 Are not we early ? <eos>
 To us . To the Mask . <eos>
 You were afraid of heights ? <eos>
 Terrified . Still am . <eos>
 He was not . <eos>
 So you had to be your own lifeline . <eos>
 Camera in the <eos>
 Bookshelf . Sensors <eos>
 Popup on floorboards . And <eos>
 We are working . <eos>
 It s a party . <eos>
 One two three . <eos>
 Do not turn . I am counting the steps to the entrance . <eos>
 These rooms are solid stone . They have not changed . <eos>
 You can not be too careful . <eos>
 Ready ? <eos>
 Can you see the other PIRs ? <eos>
 They moved it . <eos>
 Be careful not to break the laser beams . <eos>
 Careful . careful . <eos>
 We did it . <eos>
 Now s when you tell me who you really are . <eos>
 Okay you are a thief . <eos>
 Yes . Yes . <eos>
 STOP ! You are making . mistake . <eos>
 It s your mistake . <eos>
 The big job . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Your share . <eos>
 We are living history here . <eos>
 I like banks . That s where the money is . <eos>
 If you want a partner I think you should recalculate the split . <eos>
 No really it s your plan you should get at least 30 per cent <eos>
 My eighty your twenty smart guy <eos>
 Hmmm . 44 long . <eos>
 You have got everything planned . <eos>
 Idle hands the devil s workshop . <eos>
 The Mask . Where s it ? <eos>
 Do you know what you have done ! Do you know ? <eos>
 Oh my god I thought <eos>
 What about the rules ? <eos>
 Well . What are we doing ? <eos>
 Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer . <eos>
 Transfer . <eos>
 The eight billion . From them to us . <eos>
 Peoples China Bank . <eos>
 A parting gift from the Empire . <eos>
 The oscilloscope s already programmed . <eos>
 Got it . <eos>
 Then the vault how to get in the vault that s stumping me . <eos>
 That s where the Mask comes in . <eos>
 So how long till we do this ? <eos>
 There s always a surprise . <eos>
 How do I look ? <eos>
 Pulse detectors . <eos>
 Charged . <eos>
 Parachute . <eos>
 Done . And I assume you have the magic CD ROM ? <eos>
 No way to take another day or two ? <eos>
 You should not have . <eos>
 Ca not break tradition . It s bad luck . <eos>
 You have something in mind ? <eos>
 That was a lifetime ago . <eos>
 It was wrong to deceive you . <eos>
 But would you would you <eos>
 Of course not . It was just a negotiating ploy . <eos>
 Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention . <eos>
 So what are you going to do with your share ? <eos>
 Oh I do not care about the money . <eos>
 Four billion dollars . <eos>
 Seen one billion seen them all . <eos>
 Not for me . <eos>
 The sign of our partnership . <eos>
 Jesus God it s going through . <eos>
 Relax do not jam it . <eos>
 MOVE IT WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F . <eos>
 The disc s still in there . <eos>
 The door s the only way out ! <eos>
 Jesus . <eos>
 Come on . <eos>
 No way . <eos>
 Hang on . <eos>
 I cannot get rid of you . <eos>
 Put this on ! <eos>
 Take the airport subway but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong . <eos>
 You are a cop . <eos>
 You gave them the eight billion . <eos>
 A true master . Classic yet extremely sexual do not you think ? <eos>
 We need to make the trade tomorrow . <eos>
 Gin really . <eos>
 I am not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports . <eos>
 They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack . <eos>
 Which is <eos>
 In the van . <eos>
 Tina was a wonderful woman . <eos>
 I would give you a hand but it would not look good . <eos>
 Yeah the lord of the manor does not haul his own groceries . <eos>
 The porta power . comm kits . got the IR Thermo camera ? <eos>
 Had to get a liquid plasma screen . <eos>
 This s big enough . <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 That s it I sure as hell s not no personal shopper . <eos>
 I would say she s a size 6 who wears a size 4 . <eos>
 Oh it is . <eos>
 I said a masked ball not a costume party . <eos>
 How the hell I am supposed to know the damn difference ? <eos>
 It s too soon . <eos>
 The early bird gets the damn worm . <eos>
 So patience Thibeau patience . Trust me . <eos>
 Remind me why . <eos>
 You two make quite a couple . <eos>
 We are supposed to . <eos>
 You better not be taking on a new partner . <eos>
 Suspicious after all these years ? <eos>
 Oh look at me darling . I thought this gentleman was a waiter . <eos>
 You damn well thought wrong . <eos>
 Tonight your league night ? <eos>
 This s just show and tell . <eos>
 I am waiting for the tell part . <eos>
 She s calling the shots now . <eos>
 You know where my loyalties lie . <eos>
 You are giving them to me ? <eos>
 Call it an expression of trust . <eos>
 Takes a lot out of you one like this . <eos>
 See you . <eos>
 Probably not . <eos>
 Oh hell . I am dyslexic . <eos>
 Where have you been ? <eos>
 What the fuck did you do with my stuff ? <eos>
 Wait a minute I thought we were negotiating here . <eos>
 Tony Marvin . <eos>
 Oh Jesus . Who s responsible for his pain and suffering this time ? <eos>
 His dry cleaners . You want him ? <eos>
 Tequila . From your drug dealer friend . <eos>
 You should not judge Brenda . <eos>

 Meningitis ? What the hell s meningitis ? <eos>
 It s an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain . <eos>
 How does someone get meningitis ? <eos>
 Usually in adults it s from exposure to bacteria or a virus or . <eos>
 Hi . Donna Irving ? <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 I am Erin Brockovich from Masry Vititoe ? <eos>
 This s a real nice place you got here . <eos>
 Well they paid for the doctor s visit . <eos>
 Wow . Why would they do that ? <eos>
 Cause of the chromium . <eos>
 The what ? <eos>
 An on site monitoring well ? That means <eos>
 It was right up on the PG E property over there . <eos>
 And you say this stuff this hexavalent chromium it s poisonous ? <eos>
 The judge came up with a number . <eos>
 A number for the whole group or for us ? <eos>
 Oh my God . <eos>
 And he s making them give five million of it to you all . <eos>
 Five million dollars ? <eos>
 I can put them in a good school . <eos>
 Any school you want . <eos>
 And get someone to help around the house . <eos>
 Yup . <eos>
 Open and shut ? u Open and fucking shut u ? <eos>
 I am sorry Erin . <eos>

 You said things would be fine and they are not . <eos>
 All I have s hundreds . <eos>

 Then I do not get anything either . <eos>
 Hunh uh . Absolutely not . <eos>

 How many families we talking about here ? <eos>
 Four more . Eleven people . So far . <eos>
 This s a whole different ball game Erin . A much bigger deal . <eos>
 You are doing the right thing Mr . Masry . <eos>
 Is that what I think it is ? <eos>
 You wanna talk about <eos>
 No shit . <eos>
 Oh they knew . They had to know . <eos>
 I like this case . <eos>
 You did not care about my case ? <eos>
 Hey . I like working with you . <eos>

 He said he would be at the gas station at six . <eos>
 Someone s following me . <eos>
 What kind of truck ? <eos>
 I was just asking . Are you all right ? <eos>
 Is that what you want ? <eos>
 Whoa . No shit . <eos>
 It s about 50 thousand per plaintiff . <eos>
 . but it wo not cover Annabelle Daniels s medical bills . <eos>
 And it s less than pocket change for PG E . <eos>
 Plus 40 percent of 20 million s a whole lot of money . <eos>
 Counts ? <eos>
 Why good ? <eos>
 Because u that s how people treat each other u ! <eos>
 Not in my world . <eos>
 If you tell me to relax I am gonna kick your fucking head off <eos>
 Look this s serious now . They are talking serious money <eos>
 How dare you take that away from me . <eos>
 Between 50 and 400 million definitely ? <eos>
 Uh huh . <eos>
 Wait what do you mean ten years ? <eos>
 When ? Where ? <eos>
 You are not gonna be there . <eos>
 Fuck Kurt . <eos>
 Morning ! <eos>

 Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself . <eos>
 But I know you are not gonna quit on me . <eos>
 Careful you do not spit from here you could kill someone . <eos>
 You see your office ? <eos>

 I have also been thinking about the team . Responsibilities who should cover what <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 Did he say why ? <eos>
 Nope . And I did not ask . <eos>
 And you were told to destroy those ? <eos>

 Cause I like kids . I like hanging out with them . <eos>
 This s not gonna get you laid you know . <eos>

 Who s Baxter ? <eos>
 It was . the Emperor . <eos>
 The Emperor ? <eos>
 Yes My Lord . <eos>
 My lord . <eos>
 Soon Lord Vader . <eos>
 He will learn patience . <eos>
 Much anger in him like in his father . <eos>
 He will learn . <eos>
 Will he finish what he begins ? <eos>
 The boy s our last hope . <eos>
 I can not . <eos>
 You must survive Luke . <eos>
 Ben . Ben . <eos>
 . Luke you must not go . <eos>
 But Han and Leia will surely die . <eos>
 You do not know that . Even I cannot see their fate . <eos>
 I can help them ! <eos>
 You are not ready yet . You still have much to learn . <eos>
 And that s why I must go . <eos>
 Luke I will not lose you to the Emperor as I lost Vader . <eos>
 How you doing Chewbacca ? Still wasting your time with this clown eh ? <eos>
 Growls a reserved greeting . <eos>
 Barks at the mention of food . Licks his lips . <eos>
 Barks a blue streak . <eos>
 Three patrol ships are heading our way . <eos>
 Turns on Lando the newcomer with an ominous growl . <eos>
 Howls . <eos>
 Well it s been awhile . <eos>
 Howls and shrugs his shoulders . <eos>
 Barks his concern . <eos>
 Barks at his master . <eos>
 We should have stayed and finished them off . <eos>

 Barks his consternation . <eos>
 Okay Chewie it s now or never . <eos>
 . Like we are being watched . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Help you I can . yes . yes . <eos>
 Give me that ! <eos>
 Oh a Jedi Master . Different altogether . Yoda you seek Yoda . <eos>
 . I told you I am not hungry . <eos>
 It s the Jedi s time to eat too . <eos>
 Because of my father I guess . <eos>
 Yes sir ! <eos>
 Not likely ! Where are the speeders ? <eos>
 We have not got them adapted to this cold yet . <eos>
 We will have to go out on Tauntauns . <eos>
 The temperature s dropping too fast . <eos>
 The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker . <eos>
 What s thy bidding My Master ? <eos>
 There s a grave disturbance in The Force . <eos>
 But if he could be turned he would be a powerful ally . <eos>
 Yes . yes . That would be a great asset . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 Wait . I will send a patrol with you . <eos>
 Captain Solo sir . Might I have a word with you ? <eos>
 Transport XJ . get out of here . Go ! <eos>
 Sir I was wondering . <eos>
 Sit down and shut up ! <eos>
 You too golden rod . <eos>
 It sounds like it s trying to get in . <eos>
 We are doomed . Goodbye Mistress Leia . Goodbye Captain . <eos>
 Yes Your Highness ? <eos>
 You said you were going to stay . What happened ? <eos>
 That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind . <eos>
 Han we need you here . <eos>
 We ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Not you ? <eos>
 And what are they pray tell ? <eos>
 . I am afraid there s not much left . <eos>
 An Imperial probe droid . <eos>
 I do not know what he s talking about . <eos>
 Would it help if I got out and pushed ? <eos>
 This bucket of bolts s never going to get us past that blockade . <eos>
 This baby s got a few surprises left in her . <eos>
 I know I know I see them . LEIA See what ? <eos>
 That was no laser blast . some thing hit us . <eos>
 Probably an asteroid field . <eos>
 Let s hope so . it s just the chance we need . <eos>
 Well you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong . <eos>
 I take it back . <eos>
 That Star Destroyer s slowing down . <eos>
 I am against that . <eos>
 We have got to get out of this shower . <eos>
 There there . Chewie get a reading on that . Looks pretty good . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Why Princess this s so sudden . <eos>
 Very funny . You can let go now . I am getting angry . <eos>
 You do not look angry . <eos>
 How do I look ? <eos>
 Sorry Captain being held by you s not enough to get me excited . <eos>
 Well I hope you do not expect more . <eos>
 That was no earthquake . <eos>
 Easy your worship . Only trying to help . <eos>
 Sure . I guess I make it difficult sometimes . <eos>
 Sometimes maybe . occasionally when you are not acting like a scoundrel . <eos>
 Stop that . <eos>
 You mean a man you can control . <eos>
 I do not ! <eos>
 There s something out there ! <eos>
 Where ? <eos>
 Strap yourself in sweetheart we are taking off ! <eos>
 I see it Chewie hang on . <eos>
 No lightspeed ? <eos>
 I am still not sure what you have accomplished . <eos>
 That depends . Where are we ? <eos>
 You keep logs ? My how organized . <eos>
 Well sometimes . Ah hah I knew it ! Lando Calrissian . <eos>
 You do have your moments . Not many but you do have them . <eos>
 What are you staring at ? <eos>
 Who s staring ? <eos>
 You look silly . <eos>
 You look great . <eos>
 No thanks . <eos>
 Hi kid you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark . <eos>
 Thanks to you . <eos>
 I hope you make your peace with Jabba . <eos>
 No hard feelings ? <eos>
 Are you kidding ? <eos>
 I always said you were a gentleman . <eos>
 That wo not be easy my friend . What brings you here anyway ? <eos>
 Repairs . <eos>
 Sorry friend I had no choice . They arrived right before you did . <eos>
 I forget nothing Calrissian . Perhaps you think you are being treated unfairly . <eos>
 Sorry am I interrupting anything ? <eos>
 Thanks . <eos>
 Lord Vader has set a trap for him and . <eos>
 Look I stand to lose everything by this . <eos>
 Very noble . Not smart but noble . <eos>
 You have probably never done an honorable thing in your life . <eos>
 What would you say ? <eos>
 Luke ! <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 No argument just do it . That s a command ! <eos>
 The deflector shields are gone . <eos>
 Have they analyzed the one that was killed ? <eos>
 We have picked up something outside the base in zone one moving East . <eos>
 You rest now . <eos>
 So much has happened during the period of your indisposition sir . <eos>
 Closer ? <eos>
 A tremor ! <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Rather touchy are not they . <eos>
 Artoo you did it ! I never doubted you for a second . <eos>
 Leia . What would you think if I went away for a while ? <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>
 I have this . feeling . I am not sure really . <eos>
 That s just great . Why does not everyone just take off ? <eos>
 Calm down will ya ? Tell me about Han . <eos>
 He wants to pay off that criminal he s in hock to . <eos>
 Leia ! <eos>
 This hyperdrive had better work . <eos>
 Why not me ? <eos>
 I have followed my feelings . <eos>
 I will not fail you . I am not afraid . <eos>
 It would be in seven pieces were you a Jedi . <eos>
 I do not believe it . <eos>
 Concentration . Heh ? Concentration . <eos>
 I thought those seekers were set for stun ! <eos>
 That they are . <eos>
 No no . This will not do . Anger s what you feel . <eos>
 Lord Vader . Is the dark side stronger ? <eos>
 No no . Easier quicker more seductive . <eos>
 Four this time ! The Force you feel . <eos>
 What s in there ? <eos>
 Ben ? Ben ? <eos>
 Free your mind and return he will . <eos>
 I see them ! . They are in pain . they are suffering . <eos>
 And sacrifice Han and Leia ? <eos>
 You will find I am full of surprises . <eos>
 I will die first . <eos>
 Seventeen ships destroyed we do not know how many got away . <eos>
 Anything on the Millennium Falcon ? <eos>
 It wo not get through the blockade . <eos>
 The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees like all apes are vegetarian sir . <eos>
 Good God . <eos>
 So am I . And I mean you no harm . <eos>
 Do you have a name ? <eos>
 My name s Cornelius . And this s Zira my wife . <eos>
 Nobody s going to believe it . <eos>
 Believe what ? <eos>
 Zira are you mad ? <eos>
 To a lot of psychiatric small talk <eos>
 And we can watch . <eos>
 What Lewis ? <eos>
 There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship . <eos>
 With food ? <eos>
 No clothes . Stevie they changed into them . <eos>
 What are they doing here ? <eos>
 Go easy Stevie . <eos>
 They look pretty docile . <eos>
 We shall want a full autopsy . <eos>
 But he s not us . He s your own kind . <eos>
 I should . I have been doing it half my life to Humans . <eos>
 Humans ? <eos>
 May I say something personal ? <eos>
 Please <eos>
 His reactor s starting to overheat . <eos>
 Who s that ? <eos>
 He does not look like his picture . I bet he s fake . <eos>
 Now go get dressed . We have things to do . <eos>

 I was called away on urgent business Snake . <eos>
 Do not lie to me . <eos>
 All right so I made another deal . <eos>
 I am already dead . <eos>
 Dream on blue eye . <eos>
 So what s the deal gorgeous ? <eos>
 I do not know sounds thin to me . <eos>
 You want to stay here while Cuervo Jones rules the world ? <eos>
 No that sucks . How are we getting out ? <eos>
 See you in hell Snake . <eos>
 She s overloaded ! We are too heavy . <eos>
 Shut up Plissken . <eos>
 What s the little black box do ? <eos>
 Wait a minute what are you talkin about ? <eos>
 Having second thoughts ? <eos>
 Maybe . But you are not putting any shit in me this time . <eos>
 Defense against what ? <eos>
 Let s just say it s what s best for the country . <eos>
 By the way who gives me the anti toxin ? <eos>
 A medical team will be standing by . <eos>
 Not you ? <eos>

 She s in the green . <eos>
 Lock fuel rods . <eos>
 Locked . <eos>

 Getting ready to invade . <eos>
 Does he know how to activate it ? <eos>
 Where would they go ? <eos>
 Stop the damn car . <eos>
 No way . <eos>
 Where s it ? <eos>
 Listen up . I need directions . Downtown . Somebody named Hershe . <eos>
 Sure Snake . No problem . You gonna kill me ? <eos>
 Cease fire with the bullshit . <eos>
 Me too ? <eos>
 Aw come on Snake . <eos>
 I do not know about this thing . <eos>
 I got an idea Snake . This looks like the prototype right ? <eos>
 Yeah kinda . <eos>
 So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo . <eos>
 What are you doing in here ? <eos>
 Looking to get out . <eos>
 Good . I want you out . This s my sewer . <eos>
 Kind of a bad neighborhood Snake . <eos>
 Which way to the Hollywood Bowl ? <eos>
 Could be a big one comin any minute now . <eos>
 Where s . Cuervo Jones . <eos>
 Long gone . You will never catch up with him now Snake . <eos>
 No screamin shit . <eos>
 Oh no it s the Doctor . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 Do not follow me . <eos>
 You need help . <eos>
 Be careful of the bald cats . They live in these buildings . <eos>
 How do we get out of here ? <eos>
 What the hell s this ? <eos>
 The freeway . <eos>
 What are you gonna do in Venice ? <eos>
 Find Cuervo Jones . <eos>
 Run Snake . They are coming . <eos>
 I can see you are real concerned about your daughter . <eos>
 Utopia s lost to me . My daughter s gone . <eos>
 Well I will think it over . <eos>
 Get ready shitheads . We are comin in . <eos>
 Where s the anti toxin . <eos>
 Hey what s going down Snake ? <eos>
 I am looking for somebody . <eos>
 You owe me . You left me holdin everything back there in Cleveland . <eos>
 Hershe you were in Cleveland ? <eos>
 All of us ? <eos>
 The President s promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars . <eos>
 Yeah ? Greenbacks ? I got ten million of them . <eos>
 When you threw it in what did you see ? <eos>
 Yield . I have the advantage . <eos>
 Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place . <eos>
 But your life and lands are far from here . <eos>
 Has not Merlin mended your wound ? <eos>
 Arthur . <eos>
 At last . <eos>
 Merlin will I live . . I was dreaming . <eos>
 He can be no other . <eos>
 Who s Merlin ? <eos>
 You saved me from the arrow . <eos>
 But not from your destiny . <eos>
 I want to thank you . <eos>
 Merlin help me . I need your help . I do not know how <eos>
 How ? Where ? <eos>
 In the great book . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy . <eos>
 A king must marry after all . <eos>
 Who will it be ? Put your mind to it then . <eos>
 Guenevere . And a beloved friend who will betray you . <eos>
 Excalibur ! Is it true ? <eos>
 The knights of Galys approach the camp . It would be politic . <eos>
 Where hides evil then in my kingdom ? <eos>
 Merlin tell me . Now that Guenevere s returned to me . <eos>
 That s my destiny . I have a destiny too . <eos>
 I know . I have heard noises and echoes through the stones . <eos>
 But I am here . <eos>
 Father . <eos>
 Rise Mordred . <eos>
 I have come to claim what s mine Father . <eos>
 I left it in the tent sir . <eos>
 You freed it son ? <eos>

 And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued ? <eos>
 I am going . <eos>
 I will ride with Sir Kay . Lancelot rest here . <eos>
 Do not start a war on my wedding day ! <eos>
 Who does it serve ? <eos>
 Because you and the land are one . <eos>
 The well kept secret s whether any of them has won your heart . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 And there s no maiden in the whole world who inspires you ? <eos>
 There s one . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 You . <eos>
 Me ? <eos>
 Yes . I would swear my love to you . <eos>
 The law forbids it . <eos>
 There are things about love <eos>
 Why did not he kill us ? <eos>
 The King without his sword the land without a king . <eos>
 Just a man . A knight in the King s service . <eos>
 Very well . Climb up . <eos>
 I will run . <eos>
 Listen boy it s more than twenty days from here . <eos>
 You left your husband s side ? You left your brother s wedding ? <eos>

 I am not jealous ! <eos>
 A lovestruck page ! <eos>

 The deepest secrets the forbidden formulas . <eos>
 They do . <eos>
 You provoke me Merlin . <eos>
 I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames . <eos>
 I am the desert where water disappears <eos>
 I am the sea which covers the desert forever under its weight . <eos>
 It s done . A truce . We meet at the river . <eos>
 I swear it . By Excalibur and the holy <eos>
 What issues from your lust will be mine . Swear it again . <eos>
 Now you must pay me . <eos>

 All right then . Sure . I could use the extra dough . <eos>
 You do not say ? Which picture ? <eos>
 That shirt Mr . Boone . <eos>
 I am not wearing an undershirt . <eos>
 Pish posh Mr . Boone . I am not your Aunt Tilly . <eos>
 Take a picture it lasts longer . <eos>

 Sorry . Not today . <eos>
 Oh dear . I u have u made you nervous . <eos>
 Not at the moment . <eos>
 Ah . A philosopher . <eos>
 Do you miss it ? <eos>
 You have done a helluva lot more than most people . <eos>
 You first . <eos>
 I am curious Mr . Boone . What convinced you to come back ? <eos>
 I do not know . I guess I like your stories . <eos>
 Everybody has stories to tell . <eos>
 There s no people like you in my crowd . <eos>
 You are talking through your hat now . <eos>
 Not at all . I was in the foxholes myself . <eos>
 You were a soldier ? <eos>
 You asked me to model . Remember ? <eos>
 My apologies . I had no business snapping at you . <eos>
 Good afternoon Clayton . <eos>

 If that s okay ? <eos>
 What did I tell you ? Listen . <eos>
 Who s that ? <eos>
 David . The friend I thought was in New York . <eos>
 No . The girl . <eos>
 Is that really her ? <eos>
 Are you enjoying yourself ? <eos>
 Actually no . I feel a little out of place . <eos>
 Neither of us really belongs here . <eos>
 Must have been funny for you . Seeing your monsters again . <eos>
 Run for what ? <eos>
 I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia . <eos>
 Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man ? <eos>
 Oh of course . Clayton . You finished your shower already ? <eos>
 That only leaves the rest . <eos>
 Do I have any other choice ? <eos>
 Is that ? <eos>
 I thought you would given up on my picture . <eos>
 I would like to try again . If you are game . <eos>
 Tell me something Clayton . Do you believe in mercy killing ? <eos>
 I never made it to Korea . <eos>
 What happened ? <eos>
 I am very sorry . <eos>
 Do you mind ? <eos>
 That s from your movie right ? The only monsters are here . <eos>
 I do not remember that one . <eos>
 I do not recall . Memories of the war perhaps . <eos>
 Barnett . Barnett on the wire . <eos>
 So it s going to happen after all . <eos>
 No . It wo not do . <eos>
 What wo not do ? <eos>
 You are much too human . <eos>
 What did you expect ? Bronze ? <eos>
 It s from the first World War s not it ? <eos>
 All right . Let s take it off now . <eos>
 What was that ? <eos>
 You okay ? <eos>
 Oh Clayton . <eos>
 Did I hurt you ? <eos>
 Nothing I did not deserve . <eos>
 Need some help ? <eos>
 I can undress myself thank you . <eos>
 When you die . be sure your brain s the last organ to fizzle <eos>
 You will feel better tomorrow . <eos>

 Fuck off ! <eos>
 I liked it . You learn stuff listening to old timers . <eos>
 You coming Boone ? <eos>
 Hey Boone . <eos>

 You are like a dog with a bone over this movie Clay . <eos>

 I am sorry Jimmy . But with this movie and two difficult stars <eos>
 The fault dear David s not in ourselves but in our stars . <eos>
 By the way I like the Renoir . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Should you be drinking in your condition ? <eos>
 You should have seen Georgie s face when he met Clayton . <eos>
 You only embarrass yourself . <eos>
 Oh dear . I will never work in this town again ? <eos>
 You know what I mean . Your reputation . <eos>
 But I have no reputation . I am as free as the air . <eos>
 I did not ask George to invite you . <eos>
 Yes . Perfectly . <eos>
 So what do I do ? <eos>
 I would have thought Mr . Leslie Howard would be more your line . <eos>
 Bring a mirror . Let the Bride feast upon her visage . <eos>
 Jimmy . How are you ? <eos>
 Oh nothing out of the ordinary . Growing old . <eos>
 We are all getting a bit long in the tooth . <eos>
 Please . You should not stand on my account . <eos>
 Perfectly all right . But if you would like to sit <eos>
 I am fine Jimmy . I can only stay a few minutes . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 Is that Boris ? Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion . <eos>
 We will be in touch Jimmy . <eos>
 Mr . Kay sir . <eos>
 Which ones ? I bring them all . <eos>
 Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold . <eos>
 How are you feeling Mr . Jimmy ? How s your mind today ? <eos>
 I am not forgetting your last brief chat . <eos>
 He s not going to kill the old man ? <eos>
 She s horrible . <eos>
 You will take them all Mr . Jimmy ? <eos>
 I will be fine Hanna . Thank you . <eos>
 Does the yardman come today ? <eos>
 Who was that at the door ? <eos>
 Mr . Boone . He s an interesting friend . <eos>
 I would hardly call our yardman a friend . <eos>
 Do you miss having someone to talk to Hanna ? <eos>
 I have my family . Also our Lord Jesus Christ . <eos>
 It needs a hat . There was a wide brimmed cream fedora . <eos>
 One likes to live simply . <eos>
 Will that be good for you Mr . Kay ? <eos>
 Sure . <eos>

 No . <eos>
 Your melancholy eyes . <eos>
 What a pair we are . We deserve each other do not we ? <eos>
 Why always on this night ? <eos>
 What night ? What do you mean ? <eos>
 You always give me the doll on the same night of the year . <eos>
 I did not realise . <eos>
 I have . Or there would be twice as many . <eos>
 What you are ? You would be something other than you are ? <eos>
 And if I cut my hair again ? <eos>
 You made us what we are did not you ? <eos>
 Stop her Louis ! <eos>
 I suppose we could people the world with vampires the three of us . <eos>
 Not you my dear . <eos>
 You are a liar . But you upset my plans . <eos>
 Absinthe ? You gave then absinthe ? <eos>
 Laudanum ! <eos>
 Do not Louis <eos>
 Louis put me in my coffin . <eos>
 I want more . <eos>
 How did you learn to write Claudia ? <eos>
 But you never let me see you kill Louis . <eos>
 He jests . <eos>
 Why does he call you that ? <eos>
 Claudia ! You did that ? <eos>
 You want me to be a doll forever ? <eos>
 Claudia do not <eos>
 We are immortal . You have always known that . <eos>
 You both did it ? <eos>
 Lestat . Oh God forgive us . <eos>
 Do not mock Claudia . <eos>
 Louis look at me . <eos>
 You never talked to me like that in all these years . <eos>
 Hush Claudia hush now my dear <eos>
 What was that ? <eos>
 It can not be <eos>
 The ship s sailing wihout us ! <eos>
 How do I look ? <eos>
 A beautiful child ! Is that what you still think I am ? <eos>
 You want me to be your daughter forever do not you ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Or her or her or any of them ? <eos>
 Are they my kind Louis ? Dolls never change either . <eos>
 They use no paint . And the audience think it s paint . <eos>
 She s no vampire . <eos>
 This s no performance . <eos>
 This s monstrous ! <eos>
 I have seen enough of this ! I loathe it ! <eos>
 Do you think I would let them harm you ? <eos>
 No you would not Louis . Danger hold you to me . <eos>
 Love holds you to me . And we are in danger not you . <eos>
 You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you . <eos>
 So you felt it too ! <eos>
 He can protect us Claudia . <eos>
 But if she dies . <eos>
 Bear me no ill will my love . We are now even . <eos>
 They would have killed you <eos>
 Then my luck would have changed . <eos>
 You want death ? Is it death you want ? <eos>
 You are not afraid of anything are you ? <eos>
 Give it to me ! <eos>
 Vampires . We thrive on blood . <eos>
 How do you mean start ? <eos>

 There s nothing in the world now that does not hold some . <eos>
 Fascination . <eos>
 But how do you know ? <eos>
 Read her thoughts . <eos>
 What have you done to me ? You have condemned me to hell . <eos>
 Paris ? You came from Paris ? <eos>
 What do you imagine you are Louis ? <eos>

 That s all past Lestat . <eos>
 Still beautiful Louis . You always were the strong one . <eos>
 And they frighten you ? <eos>
 You know I love the dark . But there s no dark anymore . <eos>

 You remember how I was Louis . the vampire Lestat . <eos>
 So much the better . I have got a pocket full of tapes . <eos>

 So shall we begin ? What do yo do ? <eos>
 Well what a lucky break for me . <eos>
 You were going to kill me ? Drink my blood ? <eos>
 We can not begin this way . Let me turn on the light . <eos>
 But I thought vampires did not like the light . <eos>
 You said the slave had a crucifix . <eos>
 Oh that rumour about crosses ? <eos>
 The story about stakes through the heart ? <eos>
 The same . As you would say today . Bull shit . <eos>
 What about coffins ? <eos>
 You loved Yvette . <eos>
 Can a vampire feel love ? <eos>
 Shall we go on ? <eos>
 But why did you tell her ? <eos>
 How could I not ? She had to know . <eos>
 No . it can not end like that . <eos>
 Dear God . I have failed again have not I ? <eos>
 You have not the vaguest conception under God of what you ask ! <eos>
 You promise to care for her then ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>

 You sound like Houston Mission Control . What the hell does it mean ? <eos>

 I got it on sale . A real steel . <eos>
 Here . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Kathryn . <eos>
 Would not this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime ? <eos>
 It s easier to lure sharks at night . <eos>
 Change your mind ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 You amaze me . I am more scared than you . <eos>
 I can use a shot of what he s got . <eos>
 You want me to stay ? <eos>
 Get some sleep . And tell Sean I am sorry . <eos>

 I need more pressure in the shark tank . <eos>
 No we will go through here . <eos>

 I am not going to walk through that shark arcade . <eos>
 They are not going to hurt you . They are encased in plastic . <eos>
 Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow . <eos>

 It s too soon to move him . <eos>
 So tell Calvin . <eos>

 Honey what s it ? <eos>
 Hydrophobia . <eos>
 Michael take deep breaths . <eos>
 I have to get out of here . <eos>

 I can not take water Kathryn . <eos>
 Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will <eos>
 It s a shark s tooth ! <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 That s just it Michael . We do not ! <eos>
 What did you just say before ? About water flowing through them ? <eos>
 That s why they are always moving . They have to have it . <eos>
 Somebody better get down there ! <eos>

 I want that shark Kathryn . <eos>
 You do not have to prove anything . <eos>
 Are you okay ? <eos>
 Go where ? <eos>
 On the telly . We are to film him for the evening news . <eos>
 Nobody told me . <eos>
 I just did . Can you make them do tricks ? <eos>
 They are not tricks . They are behavior patterns . <eos>
 Fine . Have them do some . <eos>
 I do not know . They are nervous and skittish right now . <eos>
 Okay now . Have Flipper flip or something . <eos>
 It s no use . They wo not come into the lagoon . <eos>
 I thought they were clever . <eos>
 I can have them walk backwards . <eos>
 No no . That wo not do . <eos>
 Unhappy combination . Most likely one s inside the other . <eos>
 I think we can capture it . I would like to try . <eos>
 You can get killed ! <eos>
 I have handled sharks before . Bigger than this one . <eos>
 Calvin let me go down there and kill the bastard . <eos>
 I will . <eos>
 Well then I am going to film it . <eos>
 Like hell ! <eos>
 I want that shark alive . <eos>
 You look like an orange worm . <eos>
 Shark bait . Draws them over for closeups . <eos>
 Lunch for Whitey . Something to munch on in case things get dicey . <eos>
 We are taking that shark alive ! <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I insist you get rid of that bomb . <eos>
 Afraid I can not do that . <eos>
 How s sleeping beauty ? <eos>

 Should be coming out of it soon . <eos>
 Could be a new dance . Walking the Shark . <eos>
 Thanks for helping . <eos>
 Not at all . <eos>
 Why are you ? <eos>
 I like it when they wake up . <eos>
 So do I . But for different reasons . <eos>
 You were quite daring in capturing him . Very skillful indeed . <eos>
 Skillful ? I missed my first shot . <eos>
 Some miss all their shots . <eos>
 You are a strange man Mr . Hutton . <eos>
 I think that you and I are natural enemies . <eos>
 Hello . I think his nap s over . <eos>
 Get ready to go . <eos>
 Believe me I am . <eos>
 Well Doctor . You have got your shark . <eos>

 They still seem nervous . <eos>
 He s a young one . <eos>

 Why did you come here ? <eos>

 Why should they ? <eos>
 Because it exists . <eos>
 It will still exit if they go on not knowing wo not it ? <eos>
 Yes . And people will live in the absence of truth . <eos>
 How many rounds did you find for that weapon ? <eos>

 You do not ? <eos>
 He s a secretive man . <eos>
 And you do not ask questions ? <eos>
 We do not share our lives the way a lot of people do . <eos>
 Does that mean . <eos>
 We have not slept in the same bed for years . <eos>
 You do not believe me . <eos>
 Will you take the job Mr . D Amour ? <eos>
 Harry . <eos>
 Harry . <eos>
 I did not marry him for love Mr . D Amour . Tonight ? <eos>
 He s good . <eos>
 Are they treating you okay ? <eos>
 I do not know where you would start . <eos>
 Well . how about some of the other illusionists ? <eos>
 They wo not tell you anything . <eos>
 They were jealous of him . <eos>
 Why ? Because he had you ? <eos>
 He . did not have me . I told you <eos>
 So why did you marry him ? <eos>
 What about Jennifer Desiderio ? <eos>
 It does not ring a bell . I have to go . <eos>
 Okay . I will keep digging . <eos>
 Oh Christ . <eos>
 It was more than that I think . <eos>
 He was the real thing right ? <eos>
 Swann said he could do stuff yes . <eos>
 He taught all this to Swann ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 You said you were not with him for love . <eos>
 I was not . <eos>

 He got up and walked . <eos>
 And this Butterfield guy <eos>
 vanished . <eos>
 Are you finished with me ? <eos>
 For now . Are you planning to go back to New York ? <eos>
 You believe that ? <eos>
 I think we walk a narrow path between . between . <eos>
 Trickery and divinity . <eos>
 They were not worth a damn . <eos>
 I heard he was the best . <eos>
 Oh I have got plenty . <eos>
 Just tell me about Swann . Or are you too scared ? <eos>
 With what ? <eos>
 Great accent by the way . Is it Brooklyn ? <eos>
 Shit . <eos>
 Mr . D Amour ? <eos>
 Go away . <eos>
 It s one in the afternoon . <eos>
 We have never met . <eos>
 Then what do you want ? <eos>
 Whose s the car ? <eos>
 Mine . <eos>
 Nah . You are driving it too carefully . <eos>
 Maybe I just bought it . <eos>
 Philip Swann ? <eos>
 You know of him ? <eos>
 I saw him in Vegas once . <eos>
 Are you a gambling man ? <eos>
 When I can afford to lose . Swann s quite a magician . <eos>
 Never call him that . He s strictly an illusionist . <eos>
 What s the difference ? <eos>
 Any movie stars buried here ? <eos>
 Probably . <eos>
 It s not a bad place . Warm . Great view . <eos>
 I do not think the dead much care . <eos>
 Are you sure ? <eos>
 Who s she ? <eos>
 What the fuck are you doing here ? <eos>
 Looking for you . I tried the hotel . <eos>
 What for ? <eos>
 Left alone ? Somebody s been murdered . <eos>
 Yes . It s regrettable <eos>
 Fuck regrettable ! I want to know why . <eos>
 What for ? You need to stay busy ? <eos>
 I like to know why things happen . <eos>
 Why people die ? Give it up D Amour . Go home . <eos>
 I want to speak to Dorothea . <eos>
 I am afraid she s not in . <eos>
 I can not let you in . <eos>
 Yeah I know . <eos>
 Leave her alone <eos>
 Are you satisfied now ? <eos>
 You rigged the illusion to fail right ? <eos>
 I tried to pay you off . <eos>
 Nix s dead and buried for fuck s sake . <eos>
 D Amour <eos>
 Shit . <eos>
 Him too . <eos>
 We have got to get you to a hospital . <eos>
 Do not bother . <eos>
 Shut up . We have lost enough lives already . <eos>
 I am sorry D Amour . <eos>
 What about ? <eos>
 Jennifer s only ever had one visitor . <eos>
 What s her problem ? <eos>
 She has no real grip on reality . <eos>
 My God . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 You have taken some strange journeys in your life . <eos>
 The Puritan ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Where would you learn that ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 That . <eos>
 At birth . I do not know you <eos>
 You know Vinovich ? <eos>
 People are pretty cagey . Who do you know ? <eos>
 For what ? <eos>
 For an introduction . <eos>
 Are they all in the business ? <eos>
 Look Ma no wires . <eos>
 You should not have followed me D Amour . <eos>
 How the fuck do you do that ? <eos>
 Now I am going to have to kill you . <eos>
 I do not think so . You need me alive . <eos>
 Illusionists get . Las Vegas contracts D Amour . Magicians get burned . <eos>
 Or murdered like Nix . <eos>
 I did it for Dorothea . <eos>
 Oh yeah ? <eos>
 So Nix wo not come looking for her ? <eos>
 I do not know what else to do . <eos>
 Oh Jeez . <eos>
 You think I am an asshole . <eos>
 Did she know where Nix was buried ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Who else did ? Did Valentin ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 They got here before us . <eos>
 . no . <eos>
 He s better off this way . <eos>
 That s where we are all going . <eos>
 Jesus . what the hell s going on in there ? <eos>
 At a guess . they just resurrected him . <eos>
 This s where we killed him . <eos>
 You did not try hard enough . <eos>
 He did something with the ground . <eos>
 Yes ? <eos>
 Can you do it ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 I got to go . I am late . <eos>

 Do not touch me . He s got . got into my head . <eos>
 Swann ? What are you doing ? <eos>

 Uh . sure . I . what ? <eos>
 I can not believe it s already starting to get dark so early . <eos>
 Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings ? <eos>
 Oh Peter you are going to pursue this . <eos>
 Hey what are you doing here in the middle of the day ? <eos>
 Forgot my car keys . What are you doing on the fourth floor ? <eos>
 I spaced out . <eos>
 What ? That s horrible ! <eos>
 Yeah I appreciate it . Thanks Josef . <eos>
 I am still shaking . <eos>
 I can not believe Will killed him . <eos>
 Well it shattered your faith in everything . <eos>
 I am just temporarily off my game . <eos>
 You need to believe in something besides yourself . <eos>
 Claire . <eos>
 What are these ? <eos>
 I do not know . What are they ? <eos>
 I found them in your file box . <eos>
 Must be a spare set . <eos>
 She s been stalking you Peter . <eos>
 What a . jerk ! <eos>
 . you wearing a watch Father ? <eos>
 What time did you make it for ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 And how would you describe him ? <eos>
 Quiet . Real quiet . <eos>
 And on the day of the murders his state of mind ? <eos>
 Seemed . on edge . <eos>
 George come in . What the hell happened to you ? <eos>
 It s nothing . <eos>
 Sure it is . If the guards did this we can file charges . <eos>
 Not the guards . Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed . <eos>
 When your secretary called she made no mention of her coming too . <eos>
 My secretary ? <eos>
 You are aware that this woman was party to the so called exorcism . <eos>
 Your court order Dr . Allen . <eos>
 You know I am not comfortable with this . <eos>
 But your patient s legally entitled to it . <eos>
 This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures . <eos>
 I certainly hope you are not lending any credence to this . <eos>
 There s a medical explanation for everything that happened . <eos>
 The doctor s concerned he may never come out of this dementia . <eos>
 Is he going to be okay ? <eos>
 Father I have nowhere else to stay . <eos>
 You will do it ? <eos>
 How are you doing ? Looking lovely as always . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 Something he said just before . <eos>
 He spoke to you ? <eos>
 So all that bullshit about God and faith . <eos>
 you would not last five minutes . <eos>
 . the ark sank the sun set the ark sank again . <eos>
 Father I am right here . <eos>
 Do not worry . about the transformation Maya . <eos>
 So . we won ? <eos>
 We won because Christ . triumphed over Satan ? <eos>
 So I guess Satan lost . Satan s the weak one . <eos>
 Father please do not die . <eos>
 Hi I would like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson . <eos>
 You need his blood type . Like right away . <eos>
 Well I know he s come here before . <eos>
 What s his name ? <eos>
 Peter . Peter Kelson . <eos>
 You just call ? <eos>
 Two negatives always make a positive . <eos>
 May I help you ? <eos>
 Peter Kelson ? <eos>
 Yes . and you are ? <eos>
 You said that malignant narcissism was not evil . <eos>
 Not pure evil . That s correct . <eos>
 And also that . <eos>
 Listen I am sorry but I am running late . <eos>
 That there s no such thing as evil with a capital E . <eos>
 Not the most popular opinion but yes . <eos>
 Ooooooh kayyyyyy . <eos>
 So . what did you think of the tape . <eos>
 I think you gave me the wrong one . <eos>
 You are sure ? There was nothing ? <eos>
 So what would I miss ? <eos>
 Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary ? <eos>
 We need to talk . <eos>
 Yes I know . <eos>
 The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford . <eos>
 So what ? <eos>
 Seven years . One baptism ? He s your mother s only brother <eos>
 What are you looking for exactly ? <eos>
 We needed to know all we could . <eos>
 Nothing yet . <eos>
 Get up ! <eos>
 Peter let go of the chair ! <eos>
 You okay ? <eos>
 When s your birthday ? <eos>
 It will happen at the exact time of your birth . <eos>
 There s nothing else here . <eos>
 What s the bible for ? <eos>
 Are you alright ? <eos>
 Sometimes when I feel weak I have these . visions . <eos>
 I am scared I am slipping back . <eos>
 We are going to do this . <eos>
 You have to say that . <eos>
 No oxygen to the brain . <eos>
 Until it happens you are still a human being . <eos>
 Plenty of time . <eos>
 What are these ? <eos>
 He was trying to tell me something . <eos>
 How much time do we have ? <eos>
 Oh Peter . <eos>
 Good seeing you again . <eos>
 Hello ? <eos>
 I know who he is . <eos>
 Maya ? What do you mean ? <eos>
 And what are you thinking we should do now ? <eos>
 I have filed a report with Father Frank . <eos>
 A lot of good that will do . <eos>
 You do not want to face it . <eos>
 Look John I am facing it . <eos>
 I would appreciate it if you would put that back . <eos>
 You know what ? You can go . <eos>
 Get out of here . <eos>
 Mr . Kelson here s the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism . <eos>
 What about that psychic what s his name Szabo ? <eos>
 He can see you Thursday . <eos>
 I think it s gonna be a waste of time . <eos>
 The police used him as a witness in this case . <eos>
 I will be at Bedford tonight if you need me . <eos>
 I plan to . You want a tip ? <eos>
 Lemme guess . The lottery . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Good of you to stop by . <eos>

 He was my blood and I demand to know what happened to him . <eos>
 It it does not matter Mother ! He s dead now ! Dead ! <eos>
 Louis please ! <eos>
 What had you to do with this Mother ? <eos>
 He s your brother ! <eos>
 No Louis ! No ! <eos>
 Your Majesty . <eos>
 How goes that favor I asked of you ? <eos>
 D Artagnan arrest them all ! <eos>
 What do you propose to do ? <eos>
 It can . I know the way . <eos>
 What are they doing ? <eos>
 The Prison of Belle Sur . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 A body . <eos>
 Excellent Athos . You have a keen sense of this man . <eos>
 Who s he Aramis ? <eos>
 Switch ? That s your plan ? It s ludicrous ! <eos>
 I have it all worked out . <eos>
 Physical resemblance s but one small thing ! Louis has an arrogance a manner <eos>
 Those can be adopted <eos>
 How s he ? <eos>
 Resting he s had a long day . Aramis <eos>
 More wine ! <eos>
 You must reconsider this plan . Phillippe s like a child he <eos>
 You can do it . <eos>
 In a year maybe two I could teach him enough to <eos>
 Three days . <eos>
 Phillippe he s very bright he s perceptive but he s in such turmoil <eos>
 You grow fond of him . That s good . <eos>
 Go on . <eos>
 But what s Porthos doing ? <eos>
 Now . You were saying ? <eos>
 But what s he doing ? <eos>
 Poor Phillippe ! <eos>
 The mask s terrifying . especially when unexpected . Do you notice ? <eos>
 Remember Phillippe . nobility s born in the heart . <eos>
 He seeks redemption . <eos>
 So what has changed ? <eos>
 Then to the Bastille . <eos>
 A simple theological discussion . <eos>
 No ! Stop <eos>
 I cannot betray Louis . I will defend him with my life . <eos>
 Pull them back d Artagnan . <eos>
 You can not do it . <eos>
 Pull them back ! <eos>
 Everyone back . <eos>
 Once you are through do not stop until you reach the river . <eos>
 They will know you helped us if we go this way . <eos>
 Forgiveness . <eos>
 I observe your forgiveness s not sweeter than a plump nipple . <eos>
 Aramis . s this the way to hell ? <eos>
 Mother of God ! <eos>
 It s also a place of burial . <eos>
 A tomb ? We are in a tomb ? <eos>
 And why are you so glum ? <eos>
 Not just a baby Porthos . I carried the child of the king . <eos>
 The child of the king is . the king . Louis ! <eos>
 No not Louis ! <eos>
 Coming ? <eos>
 What use am I ? <eos>
 We go someplace dangerous . <eos>
 Let s see you rob somebody with your pistol there ! <eos>
 Aramis . These are . these are whores ! <eos>
 So was Mary Magdalene and our Lord loved her . <eos>
 He s going to kill you Aramis . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 D Artagnan watches everything . We have to be lucky . <eos>
 He gets one day of confession each year . Today s the day . <eos>
 Who does ? <eos>
 What do we do now ? <eos>
 D Artagnan unready ? <eos>
 Do I look all right ? <eos>
 Goodbye father . I am sorry . <eos>
 D Artagnan ! <eos>
 Thanks but not for me . <eos>
 Raoul s everything to me . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 You trust his character more than anyone else does . <eos>
 Raoul s hurrying to the front so I must hurry too . <eos>
 Athos please . <eos>
 Get out of my way . <eos>
 Where are you going ? <eos>
 He lies . He s here to trap us . <eos>
 The desire for vengeance . can be a poison . <eos>
 You look so sad . Is it something I have done ? <eos>
 It s something I have done or did not do . <eos>
 I have worn this mask so long I could not sleep without it . <eos>
 How did you know ? <eos>
 Whose rooms are those ? <eos>
 The room of the King s favorite mistress ? <eos>
 Phillippe . <eos>
 Are you hungry ? <eos>
 The old man and woman called me . Phillippe . <eos>
 Your Majesty . <eos>
 The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me . <eos>
 I decided it this morning . <eos>
 Then there s one more thing of an even more personal nature . <eos>
 There s more to love than he knew or that you know . <eos>
 At least help Raoul . <eos>
 I will consider it . Now leave me . <eos>
 I just left the garden it was empty . What did you see ? <eos>
 Your Majesty . <eos>
 It shall be done your Majesty . <eos>
 Even the bedchamber passages ! Let none remain ! <eos>
 I was told this impostor was dead ! <eos>

 The food does not please you ? <eos>
 You would do that your Majesty ? <eos>
 You are beautiful . You know you are . <eos>

 Mr Disraeli . Ma am . <eos>
 Your Royal Highness . What a pleasure to see you here . <eos>
 Have you met Mr Lyle ? He s in sugar . <eos>
 No doubt you have heard the rumors . <eos>
 I take no account of gossip Your Highness . <eos>
 My concern s for the reputation of the Monarchy . <eos>
 It s the Queen s decision . <eos>
 I wish to see my mother . <eos>
 She s busy . <eos>
 Convey her a message . <eos>
 What did you say ? <eos>
 I said are you deaf as well as stupid ? <eos>
 Do you know who you address sir ? <eos>
 Whom you address . <eos>
 Well everyone s entitled to their opinion . <eos>
 Gesture ? <eos>
 I thought a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps ? <eos>
 No dinners Bertie . Why are you dressed for outdoors ? <eos>
 It s so infernally cold in here . <eos>
 Surely it s for the gentlemen to decide when to stop . <eos>
 It s a disgusting habit Bertie . It should be discouraged . <eos>
 Yes but s not midnight a little excessive ? <eos>
 Mama . <eos>
 Mr . Carter the Head Butler sits there . <eos>
 Not now he does not . This s my place . <eos>
 By whose authority ? <eos>
 We <eos>
 Checked and locked sir . <eos>
 How will I know ? <eos>
 I am sorry ? <eos>
 How will I know what she requires ? <eos>
 You will be sent a message . <eos>
 Who will bring it to me ? <eos>
 Her Highness Equerry . <eos>
 I need a man who knows where I am . <eos>
 I am sure it wo not be difficult to find you . <eos>
 Then we will have to see what can be arranged . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Go inside at once . <eos>
 Is that the Queen s request ? <eos>
 She will need to sign dispatches before she retires . <eos>
 That can wait till the weekend . <eos>
 There are important papers from <eos>
 I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty . <eos>
 What do you know about the Highlands ? <eos>
 I am a blank sheet . <eos>
 Do you hunt ? <eos>
 Occasionally . <eos>
 Dare say you can be taught . <eos>
 To shoot perhaps but not to kill . <eos>
 Forgive me I have called you out and you should have been resting . <eos>
 I am fine . <eos>
 You are injured . <eos>
 I am not married . <eos>
 Oh . <eos>
 I would not know . <eos>
 Surely <eos>
 What I do I do for my Queen . <eos>
 Was there never ambition ? <eos>
 Maybe once . <eos>
 Then I envy yo . <eos>
 I do what I do . <eos>
 For Her Majesty . <eos>
 Aye . <eos>
 But yourself ? What about John Brown ? <eos>
 I said . I serve the Queen . <eos>
 You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism . <eos>
 Her mind s set . She wo not change now . <eos>
 They do not see it . <eos>
 See what ? <eos>
 The threat . I tell them but they do not see it . <eos>
 They are not as watchful as you . <eos>
 Too busy looking after themselves . <eos>
 The greasy pole . <eos>
 No loyalty . <eos>
 I promised to protect her from people like you . <eos>
 For once in my life I am not the issue . <eos>
 She will never understand it . <eos>
 In time she will . <eos>
 She will think I betrayed her . <eos>
 Mr Brown . <eos>
 Ma am . <eos>
 You are here safely . <eos>
 Aye ma am . <eos>
 You are well ? <eos>
 I am . <eos>
 And the pony ? <eos>
 Your family sent cards . It was much appreciated . <eos>
 Archie . <eos>
 Yes . That will be company for you . <eos>
 Mr Brown . <eos>
 Yes ma am . <eos>
 The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses . <eos>
 It s a fine spot ma am . <eos>
 It s a fine spot for a bench s it not ? <eos>
 Aye ma am . <eos>
 What are those ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Those over there there . <eos>
 Craobhan geanmchno fhiadhaich . <eos>
 I am thinking of publishing my Highland Journals . <eos>
 Are they worth reading ? <eos>
 I am told so . <eos>
 Who by ? <eos>
 Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming . <eos>
 What does he know about the Highlands ? <eos>
 He has been attending at Balmoral for many years . <eos>
 That does not make him an expert . <eos>
 They are ready now . <eos>
 I hope they did not go to any trouble John . <eos>
 We took a nip of whiskey . <eos>
 To keep out the cold . <eos>
 What s it John ? John ? <eos>
 Must they always follow us ? <eos>
 I ordered it . It s for your own safety . <eos>
 Am I not safe enough with you John ? <eos>
 Aye . But there are Fenians reported on the mainland . <eos>
 The threat from the Irish s greatly exaggerated I am sure . <eos>
 John ? <eos>
 Yes ma am ? <eos>
 I was told you were in a fight . <eos>
 Yes ma am . <eos>
 Has someone seen to those bruises ? <eos>
 Ma am ? <eos>
 Then why send me back to them ? <eos>
 Forgive me gentlemen . I am late . <eos>
 Not at all Dean . Good of you to spare the time . <eos>
 I came as quickly as I could . <eos>
 You have seen the latest cartoon in Punch I take it ? <eos>
 What can we do ? <eos>
 Then they may read about me . <eos>
 Indeed and for that they are eternally grateful . <eos>
 This s my good John Brown . <eos>
 Should we take it seriously ? <eos>
 The cartoon or Her Majesty s absenteeism ? <eos>
 Well both . <eos>
 The question s do we need her ? <eos>
 So ? <eos>
 I see the Prince of Wales s here . <eos>
 What did he want ? <eos>
 We are going to lose . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 She s refusing to leave Balmoral . <eos>
 A fine choice sir . <eos>
 A distinct flushing around the cheeks . She was drunk I tell you . <eos>
 Erysipelas . <eos>
 The Queen wishes to publish an account of him . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Quite . I think I would best take it back . <eos>
 Where did you find it by the way ? <eos>
 Well no rest for the wicked Henry . <eos>
 We are expecting Brown this afternoon ma am . <eos>
 I am sorry ma am ? <eos>
 Why am I being lectured in this way ? <eos>
 Forgive me Your Majesty . In no way did I wish to suggest <eos>
 Why was I not informed ? <eos>
 I did not consider it wise in the circumstances to tax your nerves . <eos>
 The Royal Family and senior members of the household ma am . <eos>
 Just them ? <eos>
 It s Mr Brown ma am . <eos>
 What s he doing there ? <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 Mr Brown s unable to attend today . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 I believe he s unwell ma am . <eos>
 Unwell ? <eos>
 I understand he was in a fight . <eos>
 How long has he been this sick ? <eos>
 A few days ma am . <eos>
 Please make sure it does not happen again . <eos>
 We were expecting you to return by six . <eos>
 Read it . <eos>
 Again ? <eos>
 Who told them that ? <eos>
 I have no idea . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 There s one other matter . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 I have a letter ma am . <eos>
 From whom ? <eos>
 From Princess Helena and other members of your family . <eos>
 What do they want ? <eos>
 Where s my son ? <eos>
 Prince Albert s at Windsor ma am . <eos>
 Why s he not here ? <eos>
 He s sick ma am . <eos>
 Then why are you not with him ? <eos>
 You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral . <eos>
 What s the matter with him ? <eos>
 What s the riddle ? <eos>
 If I tell you then it s no fun . <eos>
 Could you play ARCADE with that ? <eos>
 Thanks Albert . Think you could print up those schematics ? <eos>
 We are having some problems with ARCADE . <eos>
 Maybe he s not dead . <eos>
 He ? <eos>
 The donor . Maybe he s alive inside the game . <eos>
 Nick Alex how are we today ? <eos>
 Now what seems to be the problem ? <eos>
 It s the game ARCADE . <eos>
 If this s a joke I am not laughing . <eos>
 Neither are we . Something s wrong with the game Mr . Difford . <eos>

 Well ? <eos>
 Where to now ? <eos>
 It does not necessarily mean she s . <eos>
 Change the channel ! <eos>
 Then leave her . <eos>
 Where do we go ? <eos>

 It s growing . Getting stronger . Maybe it s only localized now . <eos>

 Anywhere . We have to stop it from getting out . <eos>
 It s already out . <eos>
 Then where do we go ? <eos>

 Okay . The floor plans will be a piece of cake . <eos>
 Then once she s in you can guide her straight to the mainframe ? <eos>
 As long as you cooperate . I want it now Armitage . <eos>
 You have got your orders . <eos>
 You find out in exactly two hours and forty five minutes . <eos>
 An odd selection Mr Case . <eos>

 Any particular reason ? <eos>
 Where there s one there s another . And another . And another . <eos>
 Well at least they have not tried to bite us . <eos>
 Which one was wearing the strange clothes ? <eos>
 Will he live ? <eos>
 You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment . <eos>
 That s because Dr . Zaius realizes our work has value . <eos>
 There s a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith <eos>
 Objection ! <eos>
 Tell the court Bright Eyes what s the second Article of Faith ? <eos>
 Good morning Dr . Zira . <eos>

 Dr . Zira tell Bright Eyes to sit down . <eos>
 This hearing s absurd ! Let me tell my story . <eos>
 One s in a museum ! <eos>

 This s a joke in very poor taste . <eos>
 Sustained . <eos>
 Well . do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures ? <eos>
 With one of them . <eos>
 I told the truth at that hearing of yours . <eos>
 Because you are not unique . There was the one you call Landon <eos>
 Stop right there . <eos>

 Maybe not . <eos>
 What s the diagnosis doctor ? A touch of the sun ? <eos>
 Taylor please <eos>
 Then tell them Dr . Zaius wo not leave here alive . <eos>
 Taylor please do not treat him that way . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 Would you like to come along ? <eos>
 We can not . <eos>
 Dr . Zira I would like to kiss you good bye . <eos>
 He s moving his fingers ! <eos>
 Of course . He saw you moving yours . <eos>
 Would not it more properly be done in your office ? <eos>
 I do not state it sir . The prisoner does . <eos>
 Do you believe him ? <eos>

 I do not know . <eos>
 Nice room . Balcony and everything . Lovely view too . <eos>
 Very nice Mitchell turns . <eos>
 No thanks ? <eos>
 Dine and dance tonight ? I have got fifty bucks to throw away . <eos>
 Not tonight . <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 I am not in the mood for dining and dancing . <eos>
 We have some nice places around Vancouver . <eos>
 I have not been invited . <eos>
 The brush off huh ? <eos>
 Do not I even get my face slapped ? <eos>
 Would you mind ? <eos>
 I think I would like to dance . <eos>
 Please be a little more careful how you talk Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 I think you are drunk . <eos>
 Good evening Miss . <eos>
 They might think I was running away from something . <eos>
 Good morning . Can I do something for you ? <eos>
 No please . <eos>
 Sit down then . We often have a double up here . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 And do you amuse the guests ? <eos>
 No . Are you really going to drink that stuff ? <eos>
 Would it make you anymore amusing ? <eos>
 Whatever you say . <eos>
 Do you think I do not ? <eos>
 Thanks for the fresh air . That felt good . <eos>
 Dance ? <eos>
 I know it s a littler late for an apology . <eos>
 Much too late . <eos>
 They will know whether he killed himself . <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 Nice of him . <eos>
 He knew the immigration officer . He eased himself in . <eos>
 He was a great boy for that . What else ? <eos>
 Go ahead . if you want to . It does not matter . <eos>
 You tried to run away . <eos>
 There was not any plane . <eos>
 Want a spike in it ? <eos>
 Bad ? <eos>
 Bad enough . <eos>
 He could hardly help suspecting you . <eos>
 What time s it ? <eos>
 Quarter after one . Why ? <eos>
 Dance ? Tonight ? <eos>
 Let s not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us . <eos>
 Certainly not to me . <eos>
 Cold ? <eos>
 Want to dance ? <eos>
 Dance ? Here ? <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 That man over there . He was in the hotel lobby . <eos>
 I did not notice him . <eos>
 Then he s got to be a detective . <eos>
 Could not be . <eos>
 Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby ? <eos>
 Absolutely sure . <eos>
 You do not know who he is ? <eos>
 He s not a cop . A cop would not have kneed me . <eos>
 He was following us but he s not a policeman . <eos>
 Us ? <eos>
 All right following me . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 No matter . There s nothing I can do about it . <eos>
 It still does not matter if I kiss you ? <eos>
 Nothing matters . <eos>
 So have I . <eos>
 No percentage in that . <eos>
 They are going to arrest me . <eos>
 I know . Killaine has a warrant . <eos>
 Take me where I have not the courage to take myself . <eos>
 I would still go through even if I ended up in jail . <eos>
 You would not like it . I have been there . <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 See anything ? <eos>
 I can still see the shoreline . The moon s rising . <eos>
 Cold ? <eos>
 Wonder what ? <eos>
 If you are doing all this just for me . <eos>
 Including Killaine . <eos>
 In a way . <eos>
 If it was an accident you could have told the truth . <eos>
 So could you . But our records were a little against us . <eos>
 Not this one . And not Mitchell . <eos>
 And I am begging for my life and yours . <eos>
 Magruder does . <eos>
 Me ? <eos>
 I think you mean that . <eos>
 Do you think I was faking ? <eos>
 Yes Miss . <eos>
 I would like a dry Martini . Very dry please . <eos>
 Sorry Miss . Beer and ale only . Canadian law . <eos>
 Beer ? Well all right . <eos>
 Beer or ale Miss ? <eos>
 Ale . I do not mind . <eos>
 Mrs . West s a very emotional woman . <eos>
 I will have to know a little more than that . <eos>
 Please answer my question . <eos>
 You did not ask a question . You made a speech . <eos>
 That s an evasion and you know it . <eos>
 Who told you I was married ? <eos>
 Your family coat of arms Mr . Killaine ? <eos>
 Regimental ! Seaforth Highlanders . <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>
 Stop saying you are sorry . I want information not regrets . <eos>
 What this ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Where s you get it ? <eos>
 An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that . <eos>
 Why do not you arrest me and be done with it . <eos>
 Deep blue ? I would call it grey blue . <eos>
 FLorida ? <eos>
 We would not have met at all . <eos>
 True . I was a bit irritable last night . I apologize . <eos>
 You were a galahad compared to some cops I have known . <eos>
 You have had dealings with the police before ? <eos>
 Who has not one way or another ? <eos>
 But not in the investigation of a major crime I hope . <eos>
 You were there when I last saw him . <eos>
 You or the Vancouver Police Department ? <eos>
 Nobody can help me . You least of all . <eos>
 If I understand what you meant by that . <eos>
 You understand perfectly . <eos>
 Then there s not much I can do s there ? <eos>
 This s not a very good place to talk . <eos>
 I do not want to talk . <eos>
 I expected nothing else . <eos>
 Points very straight to her . <eos>
 He looks at the girl looks into her eyes <eos>
 They call me Jeff . <eos>
 Time s up . I am off the case . <eos>
 You have got a couple of hours maybe . <eos>
 To do what ? <eos>
 I can not answer that . <eos>
 What will they do to you ? <eos>
 I know that . <eos>
 You do things the hard way do not you ? <eos>
 But I tell you if you would only understand . <eos>
 Good morning Mr . Brandon . <eos>
 Morning . Any calls ? <eos>
 Mr . Reed would like you to call him . <eos>
 I would like a few words with you in private . <eos>
 You asked for it . <eos>
 Bluff . You have waited too long . <eos>
 For five hundred what do I get ? <eos>
 I go home and paint the kitchen . <eos>
 For two hundred ? <eos>
 I stick around and wait for the five hundred . <eos>
 A thousand . <eos>
 Got it on you ? <eos>
 Got the information on you ? <eos>
 Hi Margo . Hello Killaine . You two come together ? <eos>
 Let me introduce you . Mr . Killaine Mrs . West . <eos>
 What will you have Margo ? <eos>
 Martini . <eos>
 You make friends quickly do not you Clark ? <eos>
 Sometimes . <eos>
 And without much discrimination . <eos>
 Leave that one lay . <eos>
 All right let s see the buzzer . <eos>
 What s a buzzer ? <eos>
 So you are not a cop . <eos>
 Me a cop ? What made you think that Mr . Brandon ? <eos>
 Who told you my name ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 How s life treating you ? <eos>
 The usual grind . <eos>
 Round of golf Saturday ? <eos>
 Would it have helped if I would knocked him down ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 In case you want to have us followed . <eos>
 I do not . <eos>
 Time for a little chat ? <eos>
 If it does not take too long . Drink ? <eos>
 Thanks . Lovely view you have have not you ? <eos>
 A couple of hours . <eos>
 I have a warrant for her arrest . <eos>
 Would that make me a heel ? <eos>
 You would be breaking the law . <eos>
 Does not answer the question . <eos>
 Information . <eos>
 Do not kid me . You do not think she murdered Mitchell . <eos>
 It could have been an accident . <eos>
 That COULD BE TOLD . <eos>
 I am afraid they do . Far too often . So long . <eos>
 You do a lot of real estate trading Brandon ? <eos>
 Now and then . Mostly just for the fun of it . <eos>
 I tried it once . I lost my shirt . <eos>
 I buy my shirts by the dozen . Fortunately . <eos>
 I had a father who knew how to steal . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Hello Mitchell . Having fun ? <eos>
 What s the matter baby . Do not you like me anymore ? <eos>
 Do me a favor Mitchell . Find yourself a nice secluded park bench . <eos>
 How would you know Brandon ? <eos>
 Want to walk out . or get thrown out ? <eos>
 You do not throw guests out Brandon . <eos>
 Good afternoon Mr . Campbell . <eos>
 Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 A little something on account perhaps ? <eos>
 Rather more than a little something Mr . Mitchell . <eos>
 So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair . <eos>
 What are you doing here ? <eos>
 I do not think you locked your door . <eos>
 They will arrest that girl . Everything points to her . <eos>
 Mr . Clarendon have you ever seen this before ? <eos>
 I am sorry Inspector I do not know much about . <eos>
 Recently then . <eos>
 No Not recently . I am sure of that . <eos>
 Floater ? <eos>
 Send that ? <eos>
 Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it s important . <eos>
 Thanks Inspector . What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco ? <eos>
 I am looking for Mr . Brandon . <eos>
 I have an appointment with him right here right now . <eos>
 Go live in a tent . <eos>
 It will be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet . <eos>
 What do I get for it ? <eos>
 You get it s brother . <eos>
 I need a receipt . Sign your name across the flap . <eos>
 Open it and count it . <eos>
 You in charge here ? <eos>
 So it seems Sergeant . <eos>
 . I supposed you knew her too Inspector . <eos>
 So the shell ought to have gone over ? <eos>
 Unless the gun was slanted up . <eos>
 I will know when I find it . <eos>
 That s pretty risky business Inspector . <eos>
 Not too hard s it ? <eos>
 Maybe we have been pretty dumb <eos>
 Was that about the right angle ? <eos>
 I think so . <eos>
 Where s the shell ? <eos>
 Do I know who lives down there ? <eos>
 Pretty big chance huh ? <eos>
 This s the shell . What about the gun ? <eos>
 No suicide . <eos>
 May you what ? <eos>
 Oh nothing . <eos>
 Scotch and plain water I think . <eos>
 I never saw it before . <eos>
 What about me ? <eos>
 You did not play it for laughs last night . <eos>
 Did you ever have a serious operation ? <eos>
 Not if it clears the air . <eos>
 It does . May I go now ? <eos>
 I will investigate Mr . Clarendon s financial position <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems . <eos>
 No doubt about that one . <eos>
 How about Magruder ? <eos>
 He checks too . <eos>
 That leaves two strangers . <eos>
 So far . <eos>
 Try Betty Mayfield . The Mitchell case . <eos>
 Mayfield ? She fit into this ? <eos>
 This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon ? <eos>
 The card says so does not it ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 I hear she s a very pretty girl . <eos>
 Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment . <eos>
 Are you a policeman or a soft headed nincompoop ? <eos>
 I do not know sir . <eos>
 Well find out . Who s covering her ? <eos>
 I think you would be entirely justified sir . <eos>
 But you still think she s innocent . <eos>
 I believe you won decorations during the war . <eos>
 Get out of here ! <eos>
 So so . <eos>
 Who s the girl ? <eos>
 Her name s Mayfield . Betty Mayfield . <eos>
 Why should I mind ? <eos>
 Rich ? I have not the faintest idea . Why ? <eos>
 I have a rough idea . <eos>
 I have always been a heel . I guess I always will be . <eos>
 I seem to remember that you like to help yourself . <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 What does it look like ? <eos>
 How long have you had it ? <eos>
 You already have the checks darling . <eos>
 Of course . <eos>
 How about your new friend ? <eos>
 Right . <eos>
 Be nasty . <eos>
 She s beautiful . And young . No thank you . <eos>
 You are very attractive my dear . And you look very unsophisticated . <eos>
 Mr . Penfield . I am sorry to have kept you . <eos>
 He s a little unhappy . I hope he was not a nuisance ? <eos>
 I see . Are you a socialist Mr . Penfield ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Here I am lecturing you . Have some p t . <eos>
 You are kind to be so encouraging . <eos>
 Actually we have only just met . But we are quiet good friends . <eos>
 It s a pity she could not make it up here today . <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Shall we go ? <eos>
 Thank you . <eos>
 Now first of all tell us your name . <eos>

 Are you going to have coffee ? <eos>

 And you will join me in a sambucca ? <eos>
 So it s all worked out perfectly . <eos>
 What did you think of that Wadja film ? <eos>
 I quite liked it . I was not as enthusiastic as everyone else . <eos>
 I thought it was tremendous . <eos>
 I think it went on rather too long . <eos>
 I could not bear for it to end . <eos>
 And I did not like that man . <eos>
 Oh but he was terrific . <eos>
 And the shape of it all . It was sort of . shapeless . <eos>
 Really ? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good . <eos>
 Too bad . What did your father do ? <eos>
 Damn . They are early . <eos>
 Who ? <eos>
 I called you a taxi . <eos>
 Very thoughtful . <eos>

 I wonder if we will ever see Mary again . <eos>

 We should have asked for Cabin One . The one Mary was in . <eos>

 Yes . But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money . <eos>
 You can not go up there . <eos>

 It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves . <eos>

 Stains of blood . <eos>
 No clotting or gathering of pus . No healing at all . <eos>
 It s sacrilege ! <eos>
 I will not allow it . I will not ! <eos>
 Protest to my superiors if you like . <eos>
 It s only important what you are . An adulterer . <eos>
 I am the Lord s voice in this town . <eos>
 Wallowing in sin and lust . <eos>
 They need guidance . <eos>
 Wallowing quite literally in blood . <eos>
 Taken . Taken by the Headless Horseman . Taken back to hell . <eos>
 Do you have these persons wills ? <eos>

 May I see them Master Hardenbrook ? <eos>

 For one who calls himself a Federalist your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism . <eos>

 The Widow Windsor . <eos>
 Is that all you say ? Look at her . <eos>
 I am not here for revenge . I am here to bring justice . <eos>
 Whatever . You still need a second to tend to your things . <eos>
 What s the common thread between these victims ? <eos>

 Must be some sort of gateway . But why this place . ? <eos>
 We should go . <eos>
 Man or woman ? <eos>
 All I saw was their lantern . <eos>
 Only the heirs were killed . Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment . <eos>
 But if the farm s not mine who stole it away ? <eos>

 He only appears to be inside the cage . The point being . <eos>
 Oh you are hopeless . May I keep it at least ? <eos>

 I insist that you have it . <eos>
 You promised justice . <eos>
 If these are the random stalkings of a monster what good am I ? <eos>
 People have put their trust in you . <eos>

 And started to run . <eos>
 And started to run . <eos>

 Objection asking the witness to speculate . <eos>
 Objection . Asking witness to speculate about deceased s state of mind . <eos>

 Back at the door I asked you to back away . <eos>
 Nobody move . <eos>
 But she s <eos>
 Nice work Captain sir . <eos>
 Direction s east coming ! <eos>
 What if it attacks ? <eos>
 Fifty yards and closing . <eos>
 Forty yards . <eos>
 But you have tested it ? <eos>

 Thank you Colonel . <eos>
 Captain . <eos>
 Come with me . The team s already waiting . <eos>
 What have you been told so far ? <eos>
 The usual . Plane crash . Survivers unknown . Routine stuff really . <eos>
 Anything else ? <eos>
 You talk to any reporters ? Any press ? <eos>
 From what ? What s with all the security ? <eos>
 We are moving fast considering the storm . <eos>
 How deep s he ? <eos>
 Survivors ? No I would not think so . <eos>
 Then why am I here ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 What s it ? A military spacecraft ? Like a shuttle or satellite ? <eos>
 Geologists ? <eos>
 Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year <eos>
 Wait a second <eos>
 dating the crash at least that old . <eos>
 Hold on <eos>
 Extraordinary s not it ? <eos>
 They pressurize us with helium . <eos>
 What s it Norman ? <eos>
 Picked up something ? What s it ? <eos>
 Maybe we should not . <eos>
 Like Thou shall not kill ? <eos>
 Or maybe it can not u be u killed . <eos>
 You mean what s in that thing s immortal ? <eos>
 I do not know . That s the point . <eos>
 All I am saying s someone should keep an eye on him . <eos>
 Harry s missing . <eos>
 What do you mean he s missing ? <eos>
 You can not just leave Harry down here sir . <eos>
 I told you people nobody goes anywhere unless I say . <eos>
 I am not paranoid . I know Beth . She can be drastic . <eos>
 How drastic ? <eos>
 You do not want to know . <eos>
 She should have known better . <eos>
 She put a razor to her wrists a day later . <eos>
 You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation <eos>
 Wait a second <eos>
 and then brought her down here <eos>
 Great okay . Ask him about his weapons . <eos>
 That s smart . Let s talk about guns and violence . <eos>
 You do not think weapons are important ? <eos>
 Edmunds ? <eos>
 Because if Jerry s powerful and also emotional . <eos>
 Going active . <eos>
 What the hell ? It shut us down . <eos>
 Jerry ? Please . Stop this . <eos>
 Yes sir . I am here . <eos>
 I see it . <eos>
 Can you open that panel ? <eos>
 It s not sucking sir . <eos>
 Thank you I can see that . Try something else . <eos>
 We do not have anything else to try Sir . <eos>
 Get him out of there . I thought I told you people <eos>
 I am getting no sub reading sir . <eos>
 Any sign of Harry ? <eos>
 Nothing sir . <eos>
 Nothing sir . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 Well where the fuck s he ? <eos>

 Edmunds get in here . I need you for this . <eos>
 How much damage ? <eos>
 It s chipped . <eos>
 Chipped ? The door ? How can it be chipped ? <eos>
 I do not know how it can be chipped but it s chipped . <eos>
 I thought you said there was not any damage done in the crash ? <eos>
 I did . <eos>
 Ted ? Captain ? <eos>
 Yes Harry . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere . <eos>
 So how do we get it open ? <eos>
 Gimme a report I want <eos>
 Ladies and Gentlemen . <eos>
 Who s that ? Where s that coming from ? <eos>
 What s the message ? <eos>
 I have to tell you . It s strange . <eos>
 Ignorant . The thing s ignorant . <eos>
 With an o . Harold with an o . <eos>
 She s not gonna know . <eos>
 A half a mile long ? <eos>
 I would also like it noted <eos>
 Ted get her away from the door . <eos>
 Look at this . <eos>
 Some sort of lead or something . <eos>
 What s wrong ? <eos>
 How can he be missing ? <eos>
 They switched us over . <eos>
 To what ? <eos>
 From the sphere ? <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 The sensors are picking up something outside . <eos>
 It wo not register . It s too big to image . <eos>
 Well until we know exactly what it s nobody goes outside understood ? <eos>
 What was Edmunds doing outside ? <eos>
 Resetting the sub . <eos>
 Beth look can I trust you with a little secret ? <eos>
 I love secrets . <eos>
 That ULF report everybody s patting me on the back about ? <eos>
 I have read it twice Norman . It s brilliant . <eos>
 It s bullshit . The report s a joke . <eos>
 C mon Beth that report s like the blind leading the blind . <eos>
 Because when we get down there <eos>
 Wait down where ? <eos>
 To the spacecraft . To investigate . <eos>
 Underwater ? <eos>
 Is not there a psychological term for that Dr . Johnson ? <eos>
 You are next Norman . <eos>
 No . Go ahead . Really . Ladies first . <eos>
 Norman ! <eos>
 It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas . <eos>
 Where would this come from ? <eos>
 The library . <eos>
 My gosh Norman . <eos>
 Yeah it was awful . <eos>
 Wait a minute . <eos>
 Yeah why ? <eos>
 What ? Why . <eos>
 Beth <eos>
 I mean I am not . I was not absolutely sure if . they <eos>
 They are or they are not . Which s it ? <eos>
 What ? Wait . Do not . why are you <eos>
 I did not do anything wrong . I did not mean . <eos>
 I can not feel her bones . She s like a sponge . <eos>
 She was crushed . Feel her skin it s like sandpaper . <eos>
 Norman . <eos>
 What are they ? <eos>
 So what ? <eos>
 So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute ? Nobody . <eos>
 You are jumping to conclusions Beth . Do not get worked up <eos>
 Where did you get this ? <eos>
 In Edmunds things . <eos>
 You went through Edmunds things ? <eos>
 He s not just a Navy captain he works for the fucking Pentagon . <eos>
 Calm down Beth . Alright ? <eos>
 You said something to him did not you ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Beth <eos>
 You did did not you ? <eos>
 Do not do this . <eos>
 You bastard . <eos>
 Yeah okay . Sure Norman . <eos>
 Where are you going in such a hurry ? <eos>
 Forget the sub . <eos>
 Do not bother me Norman . <eos>
 You me and Harry ? <eos>
 You me and Harry . He s asleep . <eos>
 Maybe you should go . To the sub . <eos>
 Why should I go ? <eos>
 You should know how it works . Just in case . <eos>
 In case you die too ? <eos>
 I do not trust Harry to do it . <eos>
 I would . But my suit <eos>
 You fixed my suit ? <eos>
 You do not trust me ? <eos>
 I can not see anything . How does it look ? Still clear ? <eos>
 What s the matter ? <eos>
 You fixed this suit ? Beth ? <eos>
 Yes Norman . I did . You are just nervous . <eos>
 Still clear ? <eos>

 Deserts you ? Harry said he would take over for me . <eos>
 You get it straightened out ? <eos>
 What s Harry doing with your suit in there ? <eos>
 Fixing it . <eos>
 Fixing it ? But I fixed Where would you get all that ? <eos>
 The refridgerator . <eos>
 That was not in there before . <eos>
 We must have had it delivered then . <eos>
 Wait a second <eos>
 1 800 Deepsea delivery . I hear they are good . <eos>
 None of this was here before . <eos>
 You think ? <eos>
 You do not believe me . <eos>
 Page 87 . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 He translated it wrong . <eos>
 You think in the sphere <eos>
 He acquired some sort of power . A power to manifest things . <eos>
 But how ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Looks like some sort of code . <eos>
 Diphenyl parlene . <eos>
 Something for burns . <eos>
 It s for motion sickness . <eos>
 Valdomet . <eos>
 Ulcers . <eos>
 Sintag . <eos>
 Nothing about drowsiness . <eos>
 Tarazine ? <eos>

 Bingo . <eos>
 Riordan ? <eos>
 Antihistamine . For bites . <eos>
 Damn it ! Chloramphenicol ? <eos>
 Antibiotic . <eos>
 Parasolutrine ? <eos>

 P a r a s o . <eos>
 It s a soporific . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Causes sleep . <eos>
 It s like a sleeping pill ? <eos>
 How long does it last ? <eos>
 Three to six hours . <eos>
 I will just boost the doses . <eos>
 What ? Wait s not that dangerous ? <eos>
 How fast does it take effect ? <eos>
 It s an idea . <eos>
 Beth <eos>

 Thirty years ago . In residency . I passed out . You ? <eos>
 I am sorry . <eos>

 What was that ? I could not hear you . <eos>
 Your watch . <eos>
 What s wrong Norman ? <eos>
 I am feeling better . <eos>
 It s getting cold . <eos>
 You think I would really drink that ? <eos>
 How do you feel about snakes ? <eos>
 Snakes ? What do you mean exactly ? <eos>
 What are they doing down here ? In the bathroom ? Suddenly appearing . <eos>
 You tell me . <eos>
 Do you fear them ? <eos>
 Do not you ? <eos>
 Did you ? <eos>
 What s the phrase keeping up with the Joneses ? <eos>
 Against what ? Harry s unconscious . He s not a threat . <eos>
 No he s not . <eos>
 He can not manifest . <eos>
 You think I manifested the snakes ? <eos>
 Beth you are losing it . C mon . <eos>
 C mon what ? <eos>

 Well think . Because there s footprints here that are not mine . <eos>
 I do not get it . <eos>
 Norman ? Where s Norman ? <eos>
 He does not wait for an answer . <eos>
 For who ? The fish ? <eos>
 It s empty . Why would someone build a ship like this ? <eos>
 Then what s it ? <eos>
 We never even had a conversation Norman . <eos>
 Jerry . Right . I said Jerry did not I ? <eos>
 That s a hell of a mistake to make Beth . <eos>
 I am sorry . Slip of the tongue . <eos>
 Just in time too . <eos>
 In time for what ? <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Our habitat I mean . This place can not handle another attack . <eos>
 Why are you looking at me like that ? <eos>
 Like what ? I am not <eos>
 You are staring at me . <eos>
 No I am not . I am not star <eos>
 We can refuse to talk . <eos>

 This answers one of our questions . <eos>
 I can not believe that Harry . <eos>
 You mean you think I am cracking ? <eos>
 No . I did not say that . <eos>
 What s that ? That noise ? <eos>
 What noise ? <eos>
 Harry can you tell me about the sphere ? <eos>
 What are you still doing here ? <eos>
 You do not understand about the sphere . <eos>
 Norman ? <eos>
 What s it Harry ? <eos>
 What happens on page 87 ? Have you ever read page 87 ? <eos>
 Page 87 of what Harry ? <eos>
 I could never read that far . I never wanted to . <eos>
 Getting anywhere with those ? <eos>

 When I woke up nobody was here . <eos>
 She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me . <eos>
 Her suit s gone . <eos>
 Beth left ? <eos>
 She s cracking Norman . <eos>
 But why would she ? <eos>
 Wisconsin s your answer . <eos>
 Wisconsin ? <eos>
 Navy transmission . They are sent from Wisconsin . <eos>
 How do we decode it ? <eos>
 The three of us . <eos>
 That s right . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 It s the squid ! Stop it ! <eos>
 Did I kill her ? <eos>
 I do not think so . <eos>
 Fine . <eos>
 We are never gonna make it . <eos>
 How much time you figure to get to the surface ? <eos>
 Two and a half minutes . Once we are in the sub . <eos>
 I can not reach her . <eos>
 Push her c mon . <eos>
 Missed . <eos>
 Hold on . <eos>
 Hurry Norman . Four minutes . <eos>
 Three fifty six three fifty five three <eos>

 Her legs are in the way . <eos>
 Get her out of the seat I need room to sit . Harry ? <eos>

 Well press something ! <eos>
 Less than a minute we are never gonna make it . <eos>
 There s one possibility . <eos>
 You mean forget ? <eos>
 She told me what you said Norman . <eos>
 What s it Harry ? <eos>
 Easy Ted we are not mining gold . <eos>
 Alot like . You know I noticed it before but I did not . <eos>
 English ? <eos>
 You do not think it does ? I think it s rather obvious . <eos>
 But it s impossible . <eos>
 Why would this ship carry instructions in English ? <eos>
 All the facts you need are right in front of you . <eos>
 Gimme a minute here . I think I have got it . <eos>
 Do you ? <eos>
 If it s an alien spacecraft <eos>
 Meaning ? <eos>
 Meaning it did not land in the water . <eos>
 Please . It must have flown here <eos>
 It did not fly here . It u arrived u here . <eos>
 Arrived ? From where ? <eos>
 Salt s good for you Ted . Helps you from getting impotent . <eos>
 What would you say ? <eos>
 Good idea Ted . <eos>
 Norman Johnson . <eos>
 Does this mean what I think it means ? <eos>
 It s over sir The storm has cleared . <eos>
 The ships ? <eos>
 How are the others ? <eos>

 Any other bags Dr . Johnson ? <eos>
 No other equipment ? Scientific instruments ? <eos>
 No they did not say <eos>
 Captain Barnes wants to see you right away sir . <eos>

 You have heard of me ? <eos>
 Well everybody s been talking about that report you wrote . <eos>
 What report ? <eos>

 Physicists mathematicians geologists you name it . <eos>
 Geologists ? At a plane crash ? <eos>
 Strange s not it ? In the middle of the ocean no less . <eos>
 He was not feeling well . <eos>
 You want me to try ? <eos>
 Strange s not it ? You know how it would have a button . <eos>
 Earth does not have a patent on buttons Ted . <eos>
 It s not some fucking substitution code it s a direct visual representation . <eos>
 I do not see anything . <eos>
 Squint harder . <eos>
 Please Ted . <eos>
 Try this one . <eos>
 This s like nursery school . <eos>
 Do not you see it ? It s a picture of the creature . <eos>
 Well he s polite . <eos>
 What was it ? <eos>
 Barnes did not know . Could not get a reading . <eos>
 Has Harry spoken with Jerry ? <eos>
 What kind of a crash was it ? <eos>
 Do not be so supportive honey . <eos>
 Well I can not imagine five years of unemployment <eos>
 Four . Four years <eos>
 Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume . <eos>
 There s a U . S . Navy car outside Norman . <eos>
 What ? <eos>
 Was it a military crash ? <eos>
 I do not know . <eos>
 Well for one reason we do not have your other five thousand . <eos>
 Who s going to pay me then ? <eos>
 I think there are some things we should talk about . <eos>
 Fear s their greatest weapon . <eos>
 You have your father s style . You have done very well . <eos>
 We will be back before you are old man . <eos>
 Sorry but that was the only way to get you down . <eos>
 I am Luke Starkiller guardian of the Bendu . <eos>
 Oh so you are a warrior then ? <eos>
 I know that . <eos>
 You saw through me ? <eos>
 You could put it that way . <eos>
 That s not a human decision not your or mine . <eos>
 Do not you have a Kiber crystal ? <eos>
 I had one but it was taken at the battle of Condawn . <eos>
 Do the Sith know the ways of the Force ? <eos>
 What s wrong ? What s happening ? <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>
 But she s the only link between us and the hidden bases . <eos>
 You mean we should go after her ! <eos>
 I can not see ! How can I fight ? <eos>
 Try to feel it . Use the Force . <eos>
 I can not do it . I will get hit . <eos>
 Of course where you been kid ? <eos>
 That s no battle kid . They are just sitting there ! <eos>

 At his office in the Capitol . <eos>
 If he s not there try . 87 43 56 . <eos>
 Where s this . thing ? <eos>
 That s preposterous ! We have no such program ! <eos>
 The source was . shall we say completely reliable . <eos>
 It s very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man . <eos>
 Bah ! All you wanted to do was spy in our country ! <eos>
 That s nonsense and you know it ! <eos>
 Goodbye Mister Ambassador . <eos>
 Excuse me Mister President but you forgot to give me my camera back . <eos>
 I caught you red handed Mister Ambassador . <eos>
 Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source ? <eos>
 My seven body orifices ? <eos>
 That s right fella . <eos>
 Now snap out of it fella ! <eos>
 Do you have any witnesses Major ? <eos>
 Look Colonel . I have got to talk to somebody at Air Command . <eos>
 Do not worry Major . Your rights will be fully protected . <eos>
 You have wasted enough of my time fella . <eos>
 Wait a minute . The President ! That s it ! The President ! <eos>

 He wanted to talk to General Ripper did not he ? <eos>
 What s your name young lady ? <eos>
 Ceida Pietraszkiewicz . <eos>

 General Schmuck ? <eos>
 Go back to sleep baby . <eos>
 Colonel you are not drunk are you man ? <eos>
 Well Mister President . <eos>
 General Schmuck ? <eos>
 To be perfectly honest Mister President we really are not sure . <eos>
 Yes sir . One thing Mister President . <eos>
 Under the circumstances General what would you think they should do ? <eos>
 Well . I suppose penetrate the base by force . <eos>
 Combat Operations Center Major Mandrake speaking . <eos>
 This s General Ripper speaking . <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 Do you recognize my voice ? <eos>
 Why do you think I ask ? <eos>
 Good . Has the Wing confirmed holding at X points ? <eos>
 Yes sir . <eos>
 All right Major . I am putting the base on condition Red . <eos>
 Condition Red ! <eos>
 That s right . I want this flashed to all section immediately . <eos>
 A shooting war ! <eos>
 Who do you think you are talking to ? <eos>
 To you sir . But how do I know ? <eos>
 Are you trying to be insubordinate ? <eos>
 Plan R ? <eos>
 Are you hard of hearing Major ? <eos>
 Are you questioning my orders Major ? <eos>
 Sort of like a new hobby huh General ? <eos>
 That s correct Major . <eos>
 And a condition red means enemy attack in progress does not it ? <eos>
 Well I was thinking maybe an enemy attack s not in progress ? <eos>
 Suppose that were the case ? <eos>
 I suppose they are sir . <eos>
 You are damned right they are . <eos>
 How much soda sir . <eos>
 That about right ? <eos>
 What shall we drink to sir ? <eos>
 General Ripper can I ask another question ? <eos>
 Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war ? <eos>
 I do not think so sir . <eos>
 He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals . <eos>
 Where sir ? <eos>
 You are very naive Major . Do not they say they want disarmament ? <eos>
 I still ask why do they want disarmament ? <eos>
 Major you are talking like one of them ! <eos>
 Well I am not sir . Honestly sir . <eos>
 Do not be offended Major . Our President holds the same views . <eos>
 Do you think we would cheat ? <eos>
 No sir . I am sure we would not . <eos>
 Major those are my boys out there dying . <eos>
 To peace on earth Major . <eos>
 It was a honest mistake sir . <eos>
 And I suppose there s some reason why you have not recalled them ? <eos>
 Yes sir . The base commander General Ripper selected Plan R ? <eos>
 General Jack D . Ripper sir . <eos>
 I want to talk to General Ripper . <eos>
 I do not think that s a fair analogy sir . <eos>
 Have you received acknowledgements from every plane ? <eos>
 They are coming in now . <eos>
 I believe it will be just a few minutes at the most . <eos>
 How many planes did we lose ? <eos>
 General Schmuck are you positive of your figures ? <eos>
 Naturally I am sir . <eos>
 He says they have only shot down three planes . <eos>
 Well if you choose to take his word over mine <eos>
 Yeah to see if we are on our toes . <eos>

 Mad about the boy . <eos>
 What s the matter with you ? <eos>
 What right do you have to take me for granted ? <eos>
 Go away . <eos>
 What kind of a silly thing was that to do ? <eos>
 Why do not you just say thank you and go go go <eos>
 You are really going to send it to De Mille ? <eos>
 Have one of mine . <eos>
 What on earth darling ? It took you hours . <eos>

 I made your bed this afternoon . <eos>
 There s the bathroom . I put in soap and a toothbrush . <eos>
 Naturally . I brought them myself . <eos>

 Bring something to drink . <eos>
 Madame s wanted on the telephone . <eos>
 You know better than to interrupt me . <eos>
 Paramount s calling . <eos>

 I myself was surprised at Mr . de Mille s manners . <eos>
 Say that I am busy and hang up . <eos>
 Cameras ? . What s it Max ? <eos>
 What s the scene ? Where am I ? <eos>
 I have discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone . <eos>
 I said stop I did not say run into a brick wall . <eos>
 What s it ? <eos>

 Oh fiddlesticks . What could be dangerous about a baseball game ? <eos>
 It must be the girls . One of the girls . <eos>
 But which one ? <eos>
 Is he your entertainment for tonight ? <eos>
 He will be . In about five minutes . <eos>
 I came as quickly as I could . What s the danger ? <eos>
 A Storm Dragon ? <eos>
 Why did she have to show up now ? <eos>
 Eliminate her . <eos>
 That s easy for you to say Bianca . <eos>
 You can do it . You are the most powerful woman on Earth . <eos>
 Next time remind me to do this out in the yard . <eos>
 I think I would better keep it . <eos>
 Whatever you say . <eos>
 Sure glad you did not let make a monkey of you . <eos>
 I do not feel like it right now . <eos>
 She did not take it from you did she ? <eos>
 That little girl ? Ha . Now go on get me some tools . <eos>

 We have to have a long talk about all this . <eos>
 This s my favourite place in the city . <eos>
 Are you sure it s all right for us to be here ? <eos>
 Like it ? <eos>
 Yes . It reminds me of home . <eos>
 I used to work here summers when I was a kid . <eos>
 Ethan tell me more about this woman who s after you . <eos>
 Let s talk about us not her . <eos>
 We can not do that . <eos>
 Why not ? <eos>
 All this talk about love it s silly . <eos>
 Of Course I do not hate you . I do not hate anyone . <eos>
 There s one sure way to find out how you feel . <eos>
 What s that ? <eos>
 Let me kiss you . <eos>
 No . <eos>
 You are not afraid are you ? <eos>
 Is this how ? <eos>
 I thought I would show you one of my favourite places . <eos>
 She said it would not last . <eos>
 I do not love you any more . <eos>
 Just like that ? <eos>
 Away . From you . <eos>
 But why ? <eos>
 Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said . <eos>
 I sort of like what you said . <eos>
 That makes it worse . <eos>
 Hi . <eos>

 I am not mad at you . <eos>

 A passionfruit smoothee . <eos>
 To us . And to the seeds we will plant together . <eos>
 Oh no not you again . <eos>

 I do not want your help . <eos>

 They want me . Does not it make you proud ? <eos>

 For rabbits ? <eos>

 You talked about it ? <eos>
 That s the way I thought of them sometimes . <eos>
 Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring . <eos>
 Berry picking . <eos>
 Yes . The old fashioned way . <eos>
 And what s that ? <eos>
 Were his parents . attentive to him ? <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 You mentioned that he had a learning disability . <eos>

 He knows that ? Billy ? <eos>
 Yes . He does . <eos>
 You have talked to Billy ? <eos>

 That you did not die ? Like the other children ? <eos>
 It would be strange if you did not feel that way . <eos>
 I wo not lie . <eos>
 You seem very sure about that . <eos>
 I object to the form of that question . Note that . <eos>
 There was nothing reckless in Mrs . Driscoll s behavior ? <eos>

 Yes but what sort of a man ? <eos>
 Come on Charlie . Let s go find another and better suspect . <eos>
 Do not you want to see the rest of the exhibit ? <eos>
 You must admit it s possible that it might have been a man . <eos>
 It was you Galbraith ! <eos>
 No . <eos>
 It was you . <eos>
 It s better you do not know . <eos>
 That was unfortunate . <eos>
 I have disturbed <eos>
 I thought they came right past here <eos>

 That s why it just mauls and tears at them . <eos>
 What are you getting at ? <eos>
 Let me get one thing clear . Did Galbraith make a direct accusation ? <eos>

 Well . <eos>
 Jeanne calm down do you hear me ? Are you alright ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 I will go . <eos>
 Jeanne . the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore . <eos>
 They have abandoned me . like everyone . <eos>
 All you have to do s stop talking and just listen . <eos>
 But how do you know what you hear s the truth ? <eos>
 I do not know it . I feel it . <eos>
 So . even you do not believe in me anymore . <eos>
 Tell me . <eos>
 Did you come back to marry me or to insult me ? <eos>
 But it s what I want . <eos>
 Will you at least let me stay with you ? <eos>
 We must sound the retreat ! <eos>
 But . why . what s the point ? <eos>
 Do as I say ! <eos>
 I want to stay with you . <eos>
 I am ready now . <eos>
 Just give me a moment and then you will be free . <eos>
 I am already free . <eos>
 My gentle Captain . I am staying . <eos>
 I I do not understand . <eos>
 I am not afraid of the fire anymore . It will purify me . <eos>
 Jeanne s alive ! <eos>
 Good . <eos>
 We have to press home the attack ! <eos>
 Sound the retreat . <eos>
 But I promised Jeanne we would fight on ! <eos>
 I made no such promise . Sound the retreat for the night ! <eos>
 You are afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris ? <eos>
 I tried to . <eos>
 It was on a Sunday was not it ? <eos>
 No . I said Surrender in the name of the King of France . <eos>
 Do you have a sword ? <eos>
 Quite a few . <eos>
 Did not you also carry a banner ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Which did you prefer your banner or your sword ? <eos>
 I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword . <eos>
 And why was that ? Did it have some particular value or power ? <eos>
 No it s just . a sword s a weapon . <eos>
 And ? <eos>
 And so I . I prefer my banner . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 Yes probably . maybe . <eos>
 So sometimes you were carrying just your sword ? <eos>
 Yes but . <eos>
 Did you use the sword that you held in your hand ? <eos>
 And when was that ? <eos>
 Well . at the coronation of King Charles VI . <eos>
 W w what are you doing ? <eos>

 Am I . am I dead ? <eos>
 Dead you are worthless darling . <eos>
 Where . where am I ? <eos>
 God defeated the English not me . <eos>
 Are you alright ? Did they hurt you ? <eos>
 Quick hide in here . <eos>

 I will hear you . but not now not here . <eos>
 Trial ? What trial ? <eos>
 Your trial Jeanne . On a charge of heresy . <eos>
 But . the King my king did not he pay my ransom ? <eos>
 It seems that the English care more about you than the French . <eos>
 Show us a little more cooperation first . Where were you born ? <eos>
 In a village called Domremy . <eos>
 How old are you ? <eos>
 Nineteen . or thereabouts . <eos>
 Were you baptized ? <eos>

 The voice was in your cell ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 What did it tell you ? <eos>
 Many things . <eos>

 He s feeling wonderful . <eos>
 Thanks be to God . <eos>
 W w what has that got to do with this Maiden ? <eos>
 Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions ? <eos>
 But . her army s so small now . <eos>
 There s no need to be afraid sire . <eos>
 I am . I am not the king . <eos>
 . You look wonderful . <eos>
 Gave you ? Well now I would not quite put it like that . <eos>
 Your majesty I really think you . <eos>
 My dear loyal Tremoille I know I can count on you . <eos>
 If there was I did not see it . <eos>
 Then why did your king believe in you without any proof ? <eos>
 His face . <eos>
 Does he have hair ? <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Is it long and hanging down ? <eos>
 5000 gold crowns . <eos>
 May I without offending you inquire how generous ? <eos>

 Yes . they were . <eos>
 Good . Where are the English ? <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Good . Can you bring me to him ? <eos>
 Wait wait . <eos>

 The wind will be against us . <eos>
 What s going on ? <eos>
 Stand by with the battering rams . <eos>
 We need another ten minutes . <eos>
 Well . Shall we go ? <eos>

 There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes ! <eos>
 Yes . We can pray . <eos>
 This s no good ! <eos>
 We return to Orleans . across the bridge at the Tourelles . <eos>
 But the bridge has been pulled down ! <eos>
 Clear ? <eos>
 You look disappointed . Is not this what you wanted ? <eos>
 Jeanne . we are not enough . <eos>
 So . bring up the reinforcements ! <eos>
 Right behind us Dunois with another then thousand men ! <eos>
 Jeanne look behind you . <eos>
 Do you know how to count ? <eos>
 Who told you to wear men s clothes ? <eos>
 I . submit to Our Lord . <eos>
 Did your voice tell you to jump ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 So when you jumped you wanted to kill yourself ? <eos>
 Yes but . <eos>
 And you did not jump of your free will ? <eos>
 No ! <eos>
 Stop it ! What are you doing ? <eos>
 Nothing . just taking his teeth . <eos>
 But you can not just kill a man for his teeth ! <eos>
 Why not ? He has good teeth . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 La Hire I am warning you do not swear ! <eos>
 Jesus Christ . the goddamn English will pay for this ! <eos>
 What happened ? Who gave the order to attack ? <eos>
 God knows but it was a bad idea ! <eos>
 Prepare these as battering rams ! <eos>
 What s the use ? The drawbridge s up ! <eos>
 . the smell of victory Jeanne ! Mmmmmmm ! I love it ! <eos>
 Take mine instead here smash mine first ! <eos>
 Jeanne . get up . this s ridiculous . <eos>
 When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne did you have a horse ? <eos>
 Yes . a half steed . white . <eos>
 Who gave you that horse ? <eos>
 My king . <eos>

 What s that ? <eos>
 I could swear I heard my son call me . <eos>
 I always had chickens ducks and whatnots . <eos>
 Well you just have to move further out . <eos>
 Now how far would further out be ? <eos>
 Let us settle this tomorrow . <eos>
 Your feet are cold . <eos>
 Go back to sleep . <eos>
 I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes . <eos>
 You all act like two roosters . <eos>
 I am not going to let him get away with murder . <eos>
 Hush . <eos>
 You are always taking his side . <eos>
 Hush . <eos>
 I am trying to make him a man but you keep babying him . <eos>
 Well it s up to Suzie . <eos>
 Do you want your coat ? It s cold out here . <eos>
 No I am too hot now . <eos>
 I am worn out . <eos>
 Just stay in bed and rest . <eos>
 I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up . <eos>
 You stay inside . I will see to them . <eos>
 It s good to be able to hear that . <eos>
 You must have been really sick . <eos>
 How s the garden doing ? <eos>
 What are you having another party ? <eos>
 You better come sit down . You are still sick . <eos>
 Since this morning . <eos>
 What happened to your hand ? <eos>
 What did you put on it ? <eos>
 I do not want to hear any tales about colored people . <eos>
 Boy that s bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom . <eos>
 What could have caused this ? I just changed this damn thing . <eos>
 Everything these days s made overseas . <eos>
 Boy I thought you were about to cross the river . <eos>
 Stranger my foot it was my grandmother who helped you into this world . <eos>
 I have someone I want you to meet . <eos>
 Harry you know everything . <eos>
 How s everybody ? <eos>
 He was not able to get out of bed today . <eos>
 That smells like fresh coffee . <eos>
 Let me get you a cup ? <eos>
 Good afternoon ladies . <eos>
 As God s my witness I have never done anything to that woman . <eos>
 You must have done something to her . <eos>
 Since she has repented all she does s throw stones . <eos>
 Those boys never did have good luck . <eos>
 You damn right they did not especially Emory my cousin . <eos>
 A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days . <eos>
 How many people do you all feed ? <eos>
 Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals . <eos>
 Girl do you still sing and dance ? <eos>
 Some people grow up and change their ways . <eos>
 I know your mother s not still operating that house of hers . <eos>
 None of your business . <eos>
 Is this your house ? <eos>
 In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog . <eos>
 What must I do ? <eos>
 We can not really bring another family in here with us . <eos>
 Why not ? Harry says that s the only way to do good . <eos>
 When did you talk to Harry ? <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 I was just trying to make conversation . <eos>
 Where s Skip ? <eos>
 He s in his pigeon cage . <eos>
 I am sorry he got those birds . <eos>
 How are you ? <eos>
 Tolerably well . I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses . <eos>
 I did not mean for you to pay me for that . <eos>

 A walk . <eos>
 It was not . The Barrier stood between us but we breached it . <eos>
 Magnificent . You are the first to find me . <eos>
 We sought only your infinite wisdom . <eos>
 And how did you breach the Barrier ? <eos>
 With a starship ! <eos>
 This starship could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier ? <eos>
 It could . Yes . <eos>
 Then I shall make use of this starship . <eos>
 He has his doubts . <eos>
 Why ? Why have you done this to my friend ? <eos>
 No no it s not possible . <eos>
 Bring me the ship or I will destroy you ! <eos>
 I could not help but notice you pain . <eos>
 My pain ? <eos>
 Bad news gentlemen . Shore leave s been cancelled . <eos>
 Rescued at last . <eos>
 Admit it . We are lost . <eos>
 Sulu what are you doing ? <eos>
 Plotting our new course . <eos>
 New course ? You have no authority . What s going on here ? <eos>
 Following new course . Warp seven . <eos>
 In firing position . Torpedo armed . <eos>
 Shuttle en route . <eos>
 Position Bird of Prey ? <eos>
 Raise shields . <eos>
 But the shuttle <eos>
 What s Emergency Landing Plan B ? <eos>
 This s the Starship Enterprise . <eos>
 What s going on ? <eos>
 Can we have it quiet ? <eos>
 Enterprise this s Starfleet Operations . Come in . <eos>
 Bob ? <eos>
 Have the Klingons responded ? <eos>
 No but you can bet they will . <eos>
 Your pain runs deep . <eos>
 What do you know of my pain ? <eos>
 Where did you get this power ? <eos>
 Join my quest . <eos>
 A starship ? There are no starships on Nimbus III . <eos>
 Perhaps I have a way to bring one here . <eos>
 But how ? <eos>
 I think you gave me too much time Captain . <eos>
 Captain we can not trust anyone now . <eos>
 Why did not you beep my communicator ? <eos>
 Captain Starfleet transmission on line . <eos>
 Captain we are receiving the hostage information you requested . <eos>
 Paradise City can you boost your power ? We are barely receiving transmission . <eos>
 Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two . <eos>
 And that is ? <eos>
 Because it s there . <eos>
 Ah Captain ? <eos>
 MM . <eos>
 Oh God <eos>
 I do not understand . <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 Pack Up Your Troubles . <eos>
 Come on Spock . Why did not you jump in ? <eos>
 Captain ? <eos>
 Spock we are on leave . You can call me Jim . <eos>
 Jim . <eos>
 Yes Spock ? <eos>
 Life s not a dream . <eos>
 Go to sleep Spock . <eos>
 Yes Captain . <eos>
 Goodnight Spock . <eos>
 I could use a shower . <eos>
 What s it ? You look like you have seen a ghost . <eos>
 Spock what s it ? Do you know this Vulcan ? <eos>
 I cannot be certain . <eos>
 But he does seem familiar ? <eos>
 I do not often think of the past . <eos>
 What do you mean ? <eos>
 He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors . <eos>
 Why ? <eos>
 That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City . <eos>
 To land any closer would risk detection . <eos>
 Spock . <eos>
 Yes Captain ? <eos>
 Be one with the horse . <eos>
 You must allow us to act . <eos>
 Damnit Spock . God damnit ! <eos>
 Captain what have I done <eos>
 Forgive you ? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass ! <eos>
 If I had pulled the trigger Sybok would be dead . <eos>
 I ordered you to defend this ship . <eos>
 You ordered me to kill my brother . <eos>
 You mean he s your brother brother ? You made that up ! <eos>
 Technically you are correct . I do not have a brother . <eos>
 There you see ? See ? <eos>
 I have a half brother . <eos>
 There s got to be a way out of this place . <eos>
 This s a new brig Captain . It s escape proof . <eos>
 Is it possible ? <eos>
 I am here Captain . <eos>
 A t . <eos>
 New word . b . a . um . <eos>
 There s an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room . <eos>
 I believe I have found a faster way . <eos>
 Hmmm ? <eos>
 It would appear we are too heavy . <eos>
 Spock . <eos>
 . mark two . <eos>
 Spock . do not . <eos>
 What s this ? <eos>
 Spock ? <eos>
 Spock I thought I was going to die . <eos>
 I must have your starship . <eos>
 Who are you ? <eos>
 We must change our course at once . <eos>
 No . I did not . <eos>
 Now learn something about yourself . <eos>
 Wait ! You know we will never make it through the Great Barrier . <eos>

 I am just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes . <eos>
 They organized this not me . I have nothing to do with it . <eos>
 Well it s bad timing . <eos>
 How do you figure ? <eos>
 I suppose Boyd s the creative force behind all this . <eos>
 He is . <eos>
 He s a moron . <eos>
 He s my friend . He s not a moron . <eos>
 Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ? <eos>
 Who else ? <eos>

 Their weapons missing ? <eos>
 Sid 6 . 7 s now armed . <eos>
 On my life I promise you I will . <eos>
 There s no way Parker killed those guards . No way . <eos>
 I think we both know who did . What s so urgent ? <eos>
 Why did not anybody tell me ? <eos>
 Give me 30 seconds then flip every switch you can reach . <eos>
 Think you can do it ? <eos>
 Not from in here . <eos>
 This better not be a wild goose chase . <eos>
 How does he know who I am ? <eos>
 He hears . everything . <eos>

 Real effective security . <eos>
 You could have just flashed him your badge you know ? <eos>
 Which way ? <eos>

 We know you did not kill those guards . <eos>
 You are not capable of it . <eos>
 The rally s a little obvious as a target do not you think ? <eos>

 All the time ? <eos>

 Come on bro . Spare yourself the humiliation the degradation . <eos>
 See ? Did you see that ? <eos>
 Were you always this sick ? <eos>
 That s crazy talk . <eos>
 Do not do it Ted . Do not do it . <eos>
 Nobody knows about your mental retardation . <eos>
 Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation . <eos>
 Nobody knows about your constant masturbation . <eos>
 What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight ? <eos>
 Who the hell was your father ? <eos>
 . A bouncer ? Are you serious ? <eos>
 Oh . Well . Maybe not yet . <eos>
 So far away ? In Xenia ? <eos>
 Check this out . Hurry ! <eos>
 Hurry . <eos>
 What s it now ? <eos>
 Do not tell me . Another vision of incomparable beauty ? <eos>
 I get it now . You and me . We are dead . <eos>
 Then there must be a whole room made completely of chocolate . <eos>
 Do not be such a pansy . All of this s YOURS . <eos>
 I feel like I am entering a forbidden tomb . <eos>
 Oh how inappropriate s that ! <eos>
 You are late bro ! <eos>
 Sorry . Ginger got a little you know enthusiastic . <eos>
 You will never believe who s in there . <eos>
 I feel like I have just been hit by a Mack truck . <eos>
 Hell yes all hundred and seventeen of em ! <eos>
 Get them together . <eos>
 You got everything you ever wanted . <eos>
 Never say never . <eos>
 What gives Don Corleone ? <eos>
 We reinvented ourselves . <eos>
 New Hushpuppies do not make a new man . <eos>
 You have obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers . <eos>
 That explains the emptiness that haunts me . <eos>
 Not bad for a hack . He has a future in yellow journalism . <eos>
 From your lips to God s ears . <eos>
 You go first . <eos>
 Ladies first . I insist . <eos>
 Well . The prom s coming up . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 And I was wondering . <eos>
 Yeah ? <eos>
 I do not LIKE you . We are JUST FRIENDS . <eos>
 So that s a maybe ? <eos>
 Great jacket Teddy Bear . <eos>
 Yeah ? You like ? <eos>
 Hi Teddy Bear . <eos>
 Christy ? You want to be in Heaven ? <eos>
 Do it ? <eos>
 Which you pulled hard ! <eos>
 Remember dress up day ? You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess . <eos>
 Well ? <eos>
 You have changed since second grade . <eos>
 I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you . <eos>
 God you are so hot . <eos>
 We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning . <eos>
 We miss you . We miss our son . <eos>
 You guys are my parents . <eos>
 Son . <eos>
 I guess . <eos>
 They did do one great thing . They gave us our boy . <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 Be a sport . How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be ? <eos>
 I guess we could go to Disneyland or something . <eos>
 Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood . <eos>
 Like one of those National Geographic specials with the topless chicks ? <eos>
 Whatever helps you cope . <eos>
 I guess it s better than having tribal patterns carved in my face . <eos>
 There ya go . Always remember focus on the peach . <eos>
 Sorry I <eos>
 It s okay . You need me ? <eos>
 Shut your pie hole Jimmy . <eos>
 I I do not have the keys . <eos>
 You do know how to drive ? <eos>
 I do not have much experience with a . uh . stick . <eos>
 Now release the brake . And slide the stick into first gear . <eos>
 It s your car . These are all your cars . <eos>
 I know . I am Ginger . Miss April . <eos>
 The one with the horses . <eos>
 Hey Ted . Wanna go shopping ? <eos>
 Shopping really ? I should tell my friend . <eos>
 Do not worry . He found the chocolate room . <eos>
 Who exactly ARE you ? <eos>
 What do you mean ? I am Ted Nelson . <eos>
 Teddy ? I was thinking . <eos>
 Hmmm ? <eos>
 After graduation . maybe we could go away together ? <eos>
 Teddy I thought we were having a moment here . <eos>
 Ted ! Do something ! <eos>
 What do you want me to do ? <eos>
 This s humiliating . We are being ejected from a prom ! <eos>
 You are on the next plane home . <eos>
 My legacy . <eos>
 How are the hometown folks treating you back in Xenia ? <eos>
 Impressive . This s bigger than our whole house . <eos>
 So what brings you here at his hour ? <eos>
 My new bike . <eos>
 Very funny . <eos>
 I came to ask permission to take custody of your room . <eos>
 My room ? <eos>
 Better view more spacious new carpet . It s a no brainer . <eos>
 If you could just sign right there . <eos>
 You want it in writing ? <eos>
 You are a peach . <eos>
 He was my Grandfather too . <eos>
 I meant biologically . <eos>
 Me ow . <eos>
 Go ahead . Ask her to the prom . Get it over with . <eos>
 I have absolutely no intention <eos>
 What s it William Randolph ? Your balls need scratching ? <eos>
 Your article sucked . <eos>
 Then I will write about YOU . <eos>
 I guess . <eos>
 She said peanuts you cretin . <eos>
 Do not write that part . <eos>
 Life must be peachy on Planet Ted . <eos>
 Funny you should say peachy . <eos>
 I did my homework . Your grandfather was a peach farmer . <eos>
 My adoptive grandfather . Who knows what my biological grandfather did . <eos>
 I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted . <eos>
 Charlie s right . Jealousy s so unattractive . <eos>
 Second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit . <eos>
 Why can not you be nice to me ? <eos>
 Where are we going ? <eos>
 I can not believe your dad built this for you . <eos>
 He did not . He had it built . <eos>
 Whatever . <eos>
 Not whatever . It s two different things . <eos>
 He cared enough to want you to have it . <eos>
 He phoned it in . <eos>
 I see . <eos>
 Your dad taught you everything . <eos>
 It s all so complicated . <eos>
 Eventually you will let go . <eos>
 And then what ? <eos>
 Then you will see who s really holding on to you . <eos>
 You are amazing . <eos>
 I know . <eos>
 Even when you infuriate me I still want to kiss you . <eos>
 But you never do . <eos>
 There s gotta be something . We have to dig deeper . <eos>
 That s probably my office . <eos>
 Well ? Where the hell are you ? <eos>
 He s on the move ? <eos>
 I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati . <eos>
 I am trembling with excitement . <eos>
 That has more to do with your proximity to me . <eos>
 I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy . <eos>
 Shoes if you want to know the truth . Shoes are my thing . <eos>
 That s refreshingly deviant . <eos>
 What about you ? <eos>
 I am very aural . <eos>
 Turned out to be a scoundrel eh ? I saw that one coming . <eos>
 Do you trust me Julie ? <eos>
 Not a chance . <eos>
 I want you to trust me . <eos>
 That s hard to believe . <eos>
 I know their small town mentality can be maddening . <eos>
 I mean your pictorial . It bothers me profoundly . <eos>
 You have seen one naked breast you have seem them all . <eos>
 Which explains the continued success of Heaven for how many decades ? <eos>
 You are quick . I like that . <eos>
 Very ambitious . I like that . <eos>
 I know where you can find an excellent editor in chief . <eos>
 Yellow pages ? <eos>
 They are playing our song . Dare I ask for this dance ? <eos>
 That s part of growing up honey . <eos>
 What about Charlie ? You boys could make it a little adventure . <eos>
 Well ? Surprised ? <eos>
 Oh good lord . Are those Neptunes ? <eos>
 Only the best for my mother . <eos>
 You promise you will finish school ? <eos>
 You do not have to work another day in your lives . <eos>
 Oh . Goodness . <eos>
 You are free . You can do anything you ever wanted to do ! <eos>
 But who would run the store ? <eos>
 Everything I am s because of you . Can you ever forgive me ? <eos>
 I need your help . I am really in deep shit . <eos>
 Thanks Principal Merkin . <eos>
 I will be blunt . I know you can take it . <eos>
 I never figured you for a pimp . <eos>
 Rules are rules . <eos>
 Come on it s our only senior prom . <eos>
 You are crossing the line Mr . Nelson . <eos>
 A statue in front of city hall dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin ? <eos>
 Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking . <eos>
 You called the cops on us ? <eos>
 Uh sure . Uncle Billy . <eos>
 You do like girls do not you ? <eos>
 Of course I like girls . <eos>
 A lot ? I mean a whole lot ? <eos>
 As much as possible . <eos>
 Maybe she needs help Ted . You should be a gentleman . <eos>
 We do not allow TIPN Ted . <eos>
 There you are Ted baby . Everything all right ? <eos>
 Truth s I am a little nervous . <eos>
 YOU ? Nervous ? Why on earth should you be nervous ? <eos>
 All those people out there . It s a lot of pressure . <eos>
 Huh ! You laugh in the face of pressure ! <eos>
 Me ? The King of Coitus ? <eos>
 I told you you could do it . <eos>
 I was like a different person tonight . <eos>
 You were the new and improved you . <eos>
 Really ? You would do that for me ? <eos>
 I have been very lazy for a long long time . <eos>
 So far so good . Some of them have real Angel potential . <eos>
 My father must have been amazing . <eos>
 I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red . <eos>
 I can not wait to see the pictures . <eos>
 Thanks Uncle Billy . Thanks for everything . <eos>
 What are you doing ? <eos>
 Bad news . <eos>
 People pay good money for that ? <eos>
 Are you familiar with Heaven ? <eos>

 So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half sisters . <eos>
 You okay ? <eos>
 Take your time . <eos>
 They were in me . Both places . you know . <eos>

 Is not that against the law peeking into windows ? <eos>
 Maybe she used another name . <eos>
 I do not know what to say . <eos>
 I have got that two o clock in town . <eos>
 You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay ? <eos>
 You saw the news today ? <eos>
 Unless what ? <eos>
 Where would you come up with this stuff anyway ? <eos>
 Guess I kind of lost it there . <eos>
 It s starting Gloria . This s how it begins . <eos>
 If you want company . <eos>
 Two kids could have gotten into a fight lost a couple of teeth . <eos>
 Those are Suzie Toller s teeth . <eos>
 Poor dumb Suzie she never had a chance . <eos>
 Will you do me one favor ? <eos>
 I am tired Ray . I am going home . <eos>

 He s leaving the country . And I do not give a shit . <eos>
 That bothers you ? <eos>
 Yeah maybe a little . <eos>
 About a year ago . <eos>
 He dropped Jimmy off first ? <eos>
 Yeah . <eos>
 And when he arrived at your house was anyone there ? <eos>
 No . <eos>
 So you were alone . <eos>
 Yes . <eos>
 Did he come in with you ? <eos>
 He did say something . <eos>
 What was that ? <eos>
 I want a full scale investigation . <eos>
 You guess ? Did he or did not he ? <eos>
 What did you do then ? <eos>
 Shit what difference does it make . Nobody s gonna believe me anyway . <eos>
 He pushed into me . I could not stop him . it hurt . <eos>
