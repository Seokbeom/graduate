size 14 gothic font
the subtitles are size 15 malgun gothic
let me know if you don ' t like it
i like it
he ' s useful
how about noodles for lunch ?

shouldn ' t you make reservations for eight ?
i made reservations for shinae and shiheim
which would you like ?
i overheard them talking and called them
i ' ll cancel one after you decide
baek ki you ' ll fit in great here
pass the intern presentation and come to our team
so that ' s him
mr oh ' s intern
i don ' t know who he is but he used connections
someone made it into an ivy league
school by writing to the president
the desperate reason why he had to get in moved him
you know what happened ?
he dropped out after a semester
why ?
because he couldn ' t keep up
he only has a ged and no experience
how do you know ?
hr
treat him well
he won ' t last long anyway
uh …
yes
uh …
i usually eat lunch alone
i see
and …
young yi
i heard you pulled it off
you ' re really racing ahead of us
i ' m jang baek ki
resource team intern
i ' m jang geu rae
please excuse me
uh …
you joined late we started 10 days ago
i see
it …
… just happened that way
ask me if you have any questions
like where the paper is …
the whereabouts …
you saw me
you see everything here
but they can ' t tend to it
everyone ' s so busy
yes i ' ve learned that
but …
… you must be nervous
you can take off your jacket
i forgot
yes
who is it for ma ' am ?
how much is this new one ?
$824 for the whole suit
is that made with gold thread ?
there ' s no difference from this
the brand doesn ' t matter
let ' s go for lunch
what shall we have ? what shall we have ?
pasta ?
no way bean paste stew
you always have that
yes
aren ' t you going for lunch ?
oh i ' m not very hungry
are you a mama ' s boy ?
you can ' t do anything by yourself ?
you can ' t eat alone or …
i ' m not that stupid
i ' m really not hungry
i guess i ' m nervous
come in
thanks
sorry no room
go ahead
it ' s him
he must have great connections to have become an intern without a test
he must have a great resume
maybe he went to an ivy league school
ivy league schools must be easy to get into
anyway this is unfair
it ' s not fair at all !
hopefully they won ' t give special treatment to full-time employees
young yi is already enough
speak of the devil
geu rae !
come on over
bon appetite thanks
i ' m kim seok ho in the team next to yours
i ' m jang geu rae
hi
geu rae
come to our intern study group
oh sure
why would he join us ?
huh ?
yes young yi doesn ' t come either
no 1 ' s don ' t need study groups
where did you go for college ?
harvard ? stanford ?
or maybe your family is rich ?
i ' m a curious person you know
i only have a ged
that ' s shocking
our company doesn ' t care about educational backgrounds ?
you ' re late young yi
hey hi
today ' s kimchi stew is really good
i ' ll have pollack stew
so that ' s why he kept following her
can i have a seat ?
you eat well alone
sorry about before
sure
huh ?
people usually say  " it ' s ok "
you say  " sure "  when no wrong was done
i ' m so mad
we studied so hard to make it in as interns
we busted our behinds
no baek ki ?
huh ?
you ' re right
to improve our resume
you said so too
you were a senior when we were freshmen right ?
yeah
a lot of us are from the same schools
mr lee in it is from mine
i wonder what his family is like
he doesn ' t look all that rich
anyway you can tell his face value
do companies still have preferential hirings for the poor ?
this may sound arrogant
but i feel cheated
why did i join a company that would hire someone like him ?
maybe our school is a bit tough to get into but isn ' t this too much ?
hey
you are being arrogant alright
just treat him well
he can ' t stay here much longer
there ' s no position for him
but i feel so cheated
we really busted our behinds
cheers !
there ' s no position for him
a road opens as you travel along
a road that doesn ' t open isn ' t a road
roads are open to everyone
but not everyone can have the roads
you didn ' t think it ' s because of this ?
i mean the reason you keep failing the contest with your great skill
master
quit your part-time job
i know you ' re poor and your dad is sick
but you can ' t make it like this
this is your last year as a korea go club student
it ' ll be harder for you if you don ' t make it this year either
so quit your job geu rae
my road ended there
it ' s not because i lacked skills or luck
or because i had a part-time job on the side
or because my parents couldn ' t support me
or because my mom became bedridden
after my dad passed away
that would be too painful
so i want to think i didn ' t work hard enough
i want to think that way even if it isn ' t true
i ended up here because i didn ' t work hard
i was abandoned because i didn ' t work hard
you ' ll have to wear that one more day
i was too busy to buy one
take your time
why are your eyes red ?
i couldn ' t sleep because of you
you were tossing and turning all night
i couldn ' t sleep because of your snoring
bye
i ' m used to the lobby already

it ' s a new product right ?
yes it is
you can pay in 6 months ' installments
i don ' t have a credit card
you ' re sure it ' s new ?
it ' s all mixed up
but …
… even that could come in handy
decide on a topic first
and add the content as you go
there are some iffy files
which don ' t belong to anywhere
mom !

i ' m busy now
change into this
mom
you ' ll see when you become a dad

oh they hired someone right ?
yes
send me someone good
we ' re going to send fermented seafood to the us
if frozen octopus is mixed in is it fermented squid or octopus ?
it doesn ' t matter which is more expensive
the purity of the product is key
if octopus is mixed in octopus would embarrass one international
find all the octopus

i ' m sorry !
geez !
mr hwang teach him well !
gosh !
i ' m sorry
breathe !
why are you so worked up ?
every intern gets to you huh ?
calm down
you shouldn ' t have given him that duty
he ' s been sitting around when i told
him to set the meeting ages ago !
he ' s thorough
i guess i can ' t be as miserable as you
thanks for understanding
so you heard ?
you knew it all along ?
i heard this morning
what ?
you know who his connection is ?
what ?
geez
who is it ? who got him in ?
who ?
the executive director
why didn ' t you tell him what the problem was ?
what for ?
he won ' t be here long
that was too much yesterday
something stinks
it ' s octopus
you didn ' t go home yesterday ?
no
did you finish your work ?
no
you should ' ve just gone home
i have to decide on my presentation partner
it ' s by tomorrow right ?
you ' ll find a partner for the interview
or maybe not
the individual presentations are a bigger issue
so much work
i ' ll get going
see you later geu rae
i ' ll get going too
that makes me feel weird
i feel i shouldn ' t let that happen to me
that ' ll happen if we don ' t pass the final presentation interview
then what should i do ?
what do we have to do to avoid that ?
i was just kidding
being an intern at one international isn ' t everything
there are tons of jobs out there
anyway you ' ll have to find a partner
you can ' t do it by yourself
everyone ' s talking about ' working alone '  today
huh ?
here ok
categorize it by the alphabet and nations
double-check the costs too
look geu rae
the executive director got him in
he should have gotten someone smarter
i don’t think he put him on your team with ulterior motives
he wouldn ' t have done it to keep an eye on you
what are you to him ?
he could ' ve done it to give you trouble
but he ' s not that childish
even if he hates you
ok
i think he dumped him on your team since he was in a pickle
dong sik yes
is the report ready for the department manager ?
yes
geu rae yes
is it ready ? yes it is
he knows how to work with excel
i asked him to try checking by cost and nation
what are you doing man ?
huh ?
why ' d you ask him ?
get your act together
you asked him to try ?
you think this is practice ?
i ' m sorry
finish it by 2pm
yes sir
go for lunch
mr oh
is everything ok ?
you have no friends huh ?
it looks like a diary for yourself
they said we don’t work alone
why ' d you ask him ?
get your act together
but they ' re forcing me to be alone
you asked him to try ?
you think this is practice ?
he didn ' t want to teach me anyway
what do you mean " you don ' t work alone "  ?
huh ?
huh ?
what was that ?
there were only 3 types for summer
yes i didn ' t know what you wanted
so i ' m bringing all of them
i ' m on my way up
bye
thank you
here
it ' s ok i ' ll carry it
why ?
huh ?
1 because it ' s heavy 2 because it ' s heavy
3 because it ' s heavy
did you decide on your partner ?
oh right when is that due ?
come on it ' s by tomorrow
i haven ' t decided yet either
what about the others ?
they ' ll probably struggle not to be the odd one out
i ' m here now
yes
to mr oh ?
ok
dong sik yes
let ' s start with the cambodia case
ok
sorry but can you bring this to mr mun ?
sure
yes
mr oh
i brought the samples
thank you
did you decide on your partner ?
not yet
i was rejected by baek ki just now
i didn’t even ask but he won ' t be my partner
he ' s smart huh ?
anyway find a good partner or you ' ll be ruined
i don ' t care who my partner is
you ' re that confident ?
it ' s not that
prepare well and pass
thank you
they ' re pathetic huh ?
not you the people who left this here
oh okay
i don ' t care who my partner is
young yi
huh ?
be my partner
huh ?
you said you don ' t care who it was
i ' ll do my best for both of us
geu rae ?
is there something on my face ?
huh ?
sorry
i was thinking about something
you were totally staring at me
here
i forgot to give it to you
maybe i should ' ve just asked
anyway you ' ll have to find a partner
you can ' t do it by yourself
geu rae
i looked everywhere for you
it had totally slipped my mind …
have you decided on your partner yet ?
be my partner
why ?
let ' s be a good team
what ' s this ?
geu rae yes
hello
here
i see you skipped lunch
uh …
have you decided on your partner yet ?
no
ok
what the ?
give it to me
it ' s ok …
partner
what ' s all this ?
you ' re popular
hold on please
yes by the 18th
ok
18th …
how come no one ' s asking ?
young yi
you don ' t have your partner yet right ?
be my partner
i ' m saving you
no one wants to be your partner
huh ?
why not ?
it ' s obvious
you ' re so good
teamwork is key and you ' ll totally stand out alone
i haven ' t decided yet either
let ' s do it
geu rae
young yi
let ' s have a cup of coffee
partner ?
yes i was too busy so i couldn ' t decide yet
but i ' m … i have a lot to learn too
let ' s work hard together
to gether …
i have a lot to learn too
let ' s work hard together
team ?
we ' re a team ?
let ' s do it
let ' s work hard together
geu rae yes
are you done proofreading ?
yes i ' m almost done
geu rae
let ' s have a talk
sit down
did you decide on your partner ? huh ?
why are you blushing like that ?
nothing
gee
everyone wants you don ' t they ?
i don ' t know why but …
you have everything the other interns want in a partner
huh ?
no confidence no comprehension skills or talent
but why do they all want me ?
it ' d be great if both members of a team got good results
but if it ' s impossible
it ' d be smart to choose a loser
did you say  " loser "  ?
yes
he would make the other person look good
they ' ll stand out to the judges
that ' s why they want you
be careful of who approaches you
so that was it
familiar places i ' d visit
after my overnight part-time job
their faces clothing and directions
were all the opposite of mine
i ' d never mixed with students
or company employees
i wanted to be one of them so desperately
that i couldn ' t see the ugly truth
i was still going the different direction
i ' m alone here too
only
i didn ' t know that truth
when everyone else did
all this chaos in order …
i wonder …
… would it ever be possible to have an agreement ?
i have a lot to learn too
let ' s work hard together
where are you going during work ?
didn ' t you hear me ?
i ' m alone
what ?
so there ' s nothing i can do
what did you say ?
you said i can ' t work alone
i mean the company work
you asked me if i had friends
that it looked like a personal diary
you were right
yes
i had to do it alone
i had to be fine alone
and take responsibility alone
what … so i don ' t know anything but alone
so …
… would you teach me
give me a chance
you need skills for that
what do you mean ?
you know
no i don ' t
if it ' s because of my educa …
do you know how hard these people worked
just to get into the lobby ?
all their sweat and tears just to stay here ?
we ' re in a corrupted world where those
who lack the basics get on the escalator with lines
i guess it can ' t be helped
but …
… i don ' t support that world yet
sweat tears and frustration
how much more should i shed ?
crazy
crazy
crazy
what have i done ?
mr kim ! huh ?
you should ' ve told me about the cable !
i was about to
how come you doze off all the time ?
mr kim ! yes
come here yes sir
why haven ' t you given me the file i asked for ?
i ' ll be done soon
why are you so slow ? yes
everyone ' s ahead of you !
you started late shouldn ' t you catch up ?

you know not all interns will make it
yes sir i ' ll fix it
don ' t say that !
this isn ' t the army or school !
let ' s go for a smoke

i know you don ' t look for shortcuts
but you need to be quick
yes
you know i support you right ? yes

yes
don ' t overreact
i ' m sorry

yes hurry up
sorry i ' ll send it soon
yes thank you bye
hello
hi
geu rae huh ?

security is an issue these days
there was a big mistake recently yes
the executive director yelled at the whole team

geu rae

yes let ' s do that !
seok ho should treat us
i ' ll treat you to coffee
mr oh
how about a smoke ?
seok ho is a bit slowpoke
but he ' s meticulous
he wrote such a good draft the executive director complimented him
he totally saved us
with his translation and interpretation skills
but you know …
what ?
he came to borrow supplies
he did ?
he keeps forgetting the supply key
he works so hard he won ' t go home
when he ' s a newlywed
newlywed ?
he got married early
he ' s the head of a family
anyway …
keep an eye out for him
so that he won ' t make any mistakes he ' s being evaluated
what mistakes ?
he ' s just slow he doesn’t make mistakes
bye young yi
see you tomorrow
geu rae ?
yes ?
have you decided on your partner ?
huh ?
i ' m intern han suk yool in fabric team 2
i was working somewhere else
i hurried over after i heard about the presentation
this is so refreshing
i love factories and harbors
alright
let me hear your reason
huh ?
why do you want me as your partner ?
i started a week earlier than the other interns
i majored in mechanical engineering
and won numerous contest awards
but i ' m not interested in machines
i actually like understanding the principles and conveying it to others
i mean sales
you know what i ' m saying ?
so …
… i wanted to work for this company
and they sent me to the ulsan factory
why ?
because i had already passed
yes you ' re amazing
i ' ve seen complicated manufacturing processses
i ' ve been to interviews and met foreign buyers …
i ' m not done talking
geu rae
geu rae !
he got married early
he ' s the head of a family
he lef …  left ?
how could he just go ?

are you upset because the director visited ?
no man yeah
actually right
i ' m upset
right geu rae ?
so funny
laugh
dong sik
yes ?
you know what ?
the folder he organized was really practical
huh ?
you can see the other
teams '  work with his system
you can see the whole
process up to approval
so it ' s efficient
but !
one thing !
you can ' t write the balance
but !
it ' s good for the planning stage
you ' re soooooooooooo much better than the others
hey
that glue incident …
why bring that up again ?
he didn ' t make the mistake
huh ?
he didn ' t do it man
there was a misunderstanding man !
then who did it ?
he touched those documents
that ' s …
… a secret
gosh
oh man
i ' m sorry
are you ok ?

mr oh !
you must ' ve had a drink today

these five minutes on the rooftop will change your life
i sent it since the system was revised
i had that dish for the first time thanks to you …
don’t you remember ?
i remember the restaurant

huh ?
the site you ' re talking about …
you ' re a pervert there ?
new education committee ?
must you do that to him ?
why are you asking me to do it ?
sir !
is it what the executive director wants ?
it was always like that
even on the way to the go-academy in the crack of dawn
even when i came home after my late night part-time job
there were people outside no matter what time i start my day
i thought people would still be sleeping
but as always …
… the world is faster than me
the documents are ready sir
see you later sir
hi geu rae
i ' m going back to the site
-geu rae … -let ' s do it
let ' s do it
be partners
why did you change your mind ?
no i haven ' t
i just delayed my decision
i ' ll ask you this time
why me ?
i think your experience on the field will help our presentation
geu rae
what do you think the life is ?
you think it ' s a big question ? it ' s simple
a collection of your choices is your life
the choices you make in each moment …
… makes up the quality of your life
five minutes have passed since we came up this rooftop
don ' t forget
these five minutes …
… here on the rooftop …
… were the …
… best life-changing five minutes for you
that dog ?
that obnoxious dog ?
that arrogant dog ?
the dog with the bob ?
yeah
i understand that ' s his nickname
but why is suk yool called that ?
yeah
because he is a dog
he comes an hour earlier to work to look at girls
the two of bomb will make nuclear bomb
let ' s see who explodes first
i can ' t wait
we ' ll have to choose an item first
i ' ll leave it all to you
just share the progress through email
you want me to decide on the item by myself ?
of course we ' ll need democratic consultation
i ' ll do my share too
geu rae
i could tell right away
you have discernment
you can do whatever you want with the presentation
so can you stand out
let ' s do it
i trust your discernment
did you decide on your partner ? it ' s due today
not yet
not yet ?
there won ' t be many people left
i heard geu rae will be partners with suk yool
huh ?
young yi !
hi !
let ' s submit it
-but … -whatever we ' re the only ones left
sang hyun …
what did i say ? no one will do it with you
only i could handle you
submit it ok ?

hello
i ' m geu rae
i had the intestine for the first time thanks to you mr oh
i never eat mutton since i don ' t like meat
but as i ate mutton intestines for the first time yesterday …
… i felt the beginning of camaraderie
our kid got in trouble …
i was also able to learn mr oh ' s true feelings
what ' s he saying ?
mutton intestines ?
i ' ll do you proud as a team …
what a crazy start of the day
but he came too ?
you don ' t remember ?
i remember eating it for the second round
why ' d he go ?
well then
do you remember meeting mr ko ?
what ? i met mr ko ?
you don ' t remember fighting about glue ?
i ' m no kid to be playing with glue
geez you were sulky like a child
because he had great results
hey cut the nonsense
follow me let ' s go for a smoke
it ' s a good morning
good morning
didn ' t the executive director reject this ?
i ' ll change the conditions
but he told you not to do it last time
so i ' ll do it again changing the conditions
mr oh …
he rejected it once
also it costs a lot
that ' s why i want to do it
would i do it if it didn ' t ?
yes
you ' re sharp
at the start of the day
why does he mess up my hair ?
you could teach me
give me a chance
you need to be qualified for chances
what do you mean ?
-geu rae -yes
-if you ' re done call a dispatch rider -sure
get out punk !
you get it now ?
why you don ' t get a chance ?
why you ' re not qualified ?
-geu rae -yes
there are documents in the cabinet from 3 years ago
find the complaints regarding the osung ' s fertilizer case
also find that year ' s
mou and contracts too
osung …
contract …
what are you doing ?
what else ?
trying to interpret that
trade dictionary ?
even if i ' m fast you should catch it
i don ' t have high hopes
so at least act like you ' re trying
to understand me while you ' re here
you ' re driving me nuts
don ' t ask me again
call the guy now
osung …
again i ' ll leave it all to you
you can do whatever you want
why ?
i told you i already got in haha
hello
hello
i heard you ' re partners with suk yool
yes
then i guess i was rejected
young yi !
let ' s not worry too much about the item
and just receive something from my club seniors
-club seniors ? -mm-hmm
let ' s go to the lounge
mr lee
sorry sorry
i ' m just so close with my female juniors
aren ' t you overreacting ?
as if i sexually assaulted you or something
mr lee
i was told to be careful of women when working
you can become so scary
come to the lounge
how to choose the resources ?
mm-hmm
my senior works in ulsan
he got hired with this item
they won ' t know it
-we can tweak it a bit … -mr lee
i have other seniors too
so there are lots of material
you don ' t have much to do at all
no
i like not having much to do
but not old stuff it ' s no good
geez
why go through all the trouble ?
you ' re so uptight
geez
what ' s wrong ?
not feeling well ?
no
sit down and relax
you were busy running about today
i ' m good
come on
it ' s your boss ' s order not mine
i met him at the 1st floor café
he wants to make up for working you like a dog with a $4 coffee
they ' ll tell us the 2nd presentation assignment the day before
it ' ll be tough if we have lots of work
i wonder how geu rae ' s doing
i get suk yool
i don ' t understand why geu rae chose him
when he had so many choices
so many choices ?
didn ' t you know ?
they must ' ve thought he ' d help them stand out
they wanted to use geu rae
i must ' ve thought that too
76%
-the copies -hand them out
-sure -the overseas market is 29%
geu rae
work harder
let ' s do it
young yi
see you tomorrow
what ' s a container crane ?
container handling gantry crane or ship-to-shore …
telegraphic transfer ?
exchange rate when electronic means of transferring funds overseas
we just need to make the orders to ulsan
i ' m surprised the manager approved it
i wonder if the executive director said anything
make sure not to make any mistakes so they can ' t pick on you
there won ' t any problems since we ' ve been on this
we ' re just tight on time
-geu rae -yes
check the vietnamese case info
the loading discharging rates and df …
that won ' t be in the dictionary
-we use that term here -i know
aren ' t you talking about dispatch fees ?
the fee that ships pay for putting it there when they can ' t load and unload
can i check after i make these copies ?
huh ? go ahead
thank you
did you tell him ?
no
maybe he ' s a genius
he memorized the dictionary in 3 days
look at him prepare the presentation item too
oh my gosh
although he might not know what he ' s doing
yeah that ' s important
i wonder if he knows what he ' s doing
mr oh
do you honestly want him to make it or not ?
want my honest opinion ?
why get so serious ?
i honestly want him to fail
huh ?
again …
what is it this time ?
it ' s not sexy
do it again with something else that ' s sexy
geez
hi geu rae
why this time ?
didn ' t you get my text ?
are you kidding me ?
you don’t get me
things have changed
" sexy "  doesn ' t only refer to sexual appeal
something …
… with an edge
you probably don’t get that either
good partners would get each other right away
you ' re inflexible and conservative aren ' t you ?
you must not be able to adjust to fast changing trend quickly
that ' s not the issue
it ' s not ?
then what ' s the problem ?
that ?
geu rae
that ' s no good for the item
i ' ve won many awards …
didn ' t you say i could do whatever i want ?
i asked you to share it
i said i ' d do my share
so i have to do whatever you ask me ?
geu rae i know what i ' m doing
also i ' m what the company needs
who do you think should listen to who ?
i ' m not saying i ' m better than you
i ' m giving you good advice
then …
… what kind of item should it be ?
you find it something you ' re good at
and something sexy
i ' m in seoul for work shall i go in ?
no it ' s ok
ok call me when you ' re ready
unsexy = tooooo plain
why that …
that bomb exploded first
hello
hi
how are things going ?
not so smooth
yes right
sorry i ' m late
hi our material overlaps
let ' s talk outside come on
hello
you ' re really quitting ?
you ' ve worked so hard
try one more time
you always make it happen
yeah man
even we made it too
you were better than us
you sure you won ' t regret it ?
what ' s all that mess for ?
he didn ' t even sleep over the weekend
that ' s the only place for veggie wraps
it ' s gross
they ' re good for you though
he ' s sleeping
-should i wake him up ? -nope
he has tons of presentation items on his desk
he ' s preparing alone ? who ' s his partner ?
the guy in ulsan suk yool
the slacker ?
you know how he is
looks like geu rae is doing all of the work
so the slacker and clueless guy met
true

nagging me nonstop …

hi sang hyun
young yi

let ' s postpone our evening meeting to tomorrow
-uh … -i ' ll bring a lot of materials
uh … sang hyun
do whatever you want
geu rae
they ' re not cutting us any slack for the presentation
they want us to pull it all off
same with your team ?
yes
my partner is giving me trouble too
huh ?
you saw how stubborn he was last time
i thought i ' d just have to do my part …
… whoever became my partner
i preferred someone i could communicate with
i just wanted to let you know
i didn ' t have ulterior motives in mind that you think
-i ' m sorry -no
no need to apologize
you can do that after you pass
anything fun to share ?
-yes -yes ?
you shouldn ' t be sitting here now
your team seems to have an issue
huh ?
yes
i ' m sorry
that was just a verbal contract …
but …
yes
yes sir
i ' ll try to find a solution
yes bye
-mr oh -what ' s wrong with you ?
-i ' m sorry -i told you to check it a million times !
i ' m sorry
never mind
i approved it so it ' s my responsibility
no i …
follow me
you never make mistakes
i know you had a lot on your plate but
… i told you many times
you and i are on this project so we need to do well
actually i should ' ve checked the fta conditions
-seok ho -yes
do you know what ' s going on in my team ?
it is a big mess
mr kim ' s fine fiber duster export case
the buyer asked them to meet the fta conditions now
they just mentioned it during the
verbal contract and mr kim missed it
he didn ' t think too much about it as it was before fta took effect
as far as i know the ship leaves tomorrow
exactly but they won ' t budge
they ' ll annul the contract if it ' s not
fulfilled within the appointed date
if we make cancellations and rebook can we make the contract date ?
rebook ?
then the ship …
we have ships with quick arrival times
after all procedures and if we ' re lucky to get a quick ship …
get a ship first
or even air transport
then the cost will …
hey !
that ' s not the issue here
yes
come in
i ' ll get it fixed within 3 days
with the air fee storage and booking cancellation charge …
what will you do about the cost ?
preventing the contract annulment is the priority here
for trust in the future
you ' re aware of that and you created this mess ?
thank you
get your stuff
-let ' s go down right away -ok
get the documents on the way
i got the containers put in storage
if we go now which one can we catch ? -that …
i made reservations since the earliest is an hour later
let ' s go
ok
mr oh i ' ll …
just do whatever you were doing
-let ' s go -yes sir
i wish i can do whatever i was doing
thanks to this jerk
to our youth !
with all our energy !
geez
there ' s not enough material
some are from china indonesia and taiwan
we need to make all the documents
it ' ll be more complicated than we think
are the chinese documents ready ?
they must be there somewhere
we ' ll have to search
i think i ' ll have to check the storage and look at the documents myself
-i ' ll send a fax -ok
-what about the rest ? -mr hwang will call me
leave the importer request
i left it on your desk
dang
i ' ll ask geu rae to …
no we have tons to do here so tell him to bring it down
yes sir

-go to the storage and find some data -ok

this way
what ' s he doing ?
-uh … -huh ?
oh my !
you pervert
wait
i touched it already so i ' ll touch it once more
is he psycho ?
geu rae !
the site you were talking about …
is where you act like a pervert ?
my skin is tender like a baby
why won ' t you check the item ?
i was on my way to check it
what brings you here ?
i sent three
hurry up and check them
three ?
look geu rae
i wrote 20 pages for a single item at the company i interned at
yet you found three in a week ?
it ' s not that easy
just check it
come on
look geu rae
i ' ll do it again if i have to
if you ' re dumb you have to put in more legwork
succeed with quantity ?
no way
forty pages ?
forty-two pages ?
unbelievable
he thinks this is a love letter ?
fifty-three pages ?
gosh
you should be on your toes
you ought to concentrate
-geez -huh ?
want a massage ?
stop it !
you ' re so weird
how ' s the presentation coming along ?
huh ?
why ?
you never asked me before
-our presentation preparations … -alright
fax
yeah
it came
we just need to send it to the company with the number now
then i ' ll go to seoul and prepare the rest
see you in seoul
did it go well ?
-geu rae -yes ?
what ' s wrong with you ?
let ' s talk
i have a question
have you been conned before ?
what ?
they ' re not helpful at all
saps morale …
are you talking about yourself ?
about suk yool …
his motives are strong
if you ' re incompetent he ' ll look good
even if you ' re competent he ' ll use that …
… to look good
i see
his motives are like a tornado
he gives others damage or trouble
the center is calm though
aim for the center
did you see them ?
i heard you ' re here with mr oh because of a team mistake
how are the items ?
this is all i did there ' s so much to do
what did you think ?
well …
again ?
let ' s go with the second item
are you sure ?
yes but …
then that ' s it
huh ?
we decided on the item together
you ' re experienced and you shouldn ' t
suffer any loses because of me
you agreed on the item so we ' re set
huh ?
i ' ll create the presentation details
so it ' s beneficial for me
i ' ll share the data but i won ' t accept support
as promised
huh ?
the world of go is always a war
and …
… sometimes you retreat when approached …
… or try to survive together
but the winner and loser are clear
how old are you ?
huh ?
i lived in that world for over a decade
over the years …
… my focus on winning has grown even i ' m a loser now
i ' m a pro at it
we took care of the team ' s mistake
the certificate of origin was sent in time and the forwarding agent …
a forwarding agent is a company that organizes shipments for others
according to the trade term dictionary
it was sent to the forwarding agent
and a ship was successfully sent off in ulsan
and a few days later …
… he came
disciplinary committee ?
i know
just because there were some extra fees ?
what ' s going on ?
i know
it doesn ' t usually happen
if it happens he ' ll probably get demoted
must you do this to the young kid ?
so why redo the item the executive director rejected ?
so it was the executive director ' s idea ?
he had his reasons for rejecting it
you were playing smart about it
when you redid it you were telling him you were risking your everything
-sir ! -you should ' ve done well in the first place !
why screw up ?
the committee is reviewing it so just wait
mr oh …
-i ' ll look into it too -do your work
-geu rae -yes
if you learned about trading contracts work on that
yes
mr oh …
do your work
i ' ll take the discipline
what else can you do ?
please leave a message after …
i heard the disciplinary committee is on mr kim …
he knows everything
i know everything huh ?
you need to be quick with acquiring info
he ' s great at guessing too
i didn ' t guess
i ' m good at reading minds
i ' m an expert …
… especially with girls '  minds
he ' s crazy
culture and trade nice
change the title
people need different things depending on the culture
-culture … -wait
what does  " mentality trapped in culture "  mean ?
i just happened to write that …
geu rae
you don ' t think of our presentation as a primary school essay do you ?
these incomprehensible sentences will just do us harm
if you had to interpret it …
for example …
" would chicks in hot countries like cosmetics ?  "
" of course not and they don’t sell well "
that ' s what you meant by " mentality trapped in culture "  ?
then think about this
there ' s bp fiber
it has low durability and thermal resistance
so it ' s bad for regular clothing
so should we throw it out ?
think !
have you done some thinking ?
yes
this fiber has low thermal conductivity
-what ' s that ? -it ' s …
that ' s it ! it doesn’t absorb moisture
what ' s that ?
fast dry !  will you concentrate ?
we can sell it in cold countries but what about other issues …
this is why you need me
the power of experience
i ' d sell long johns in cold countries
to people trapped in the culture of the cold climate
i caught that but you wrote it without any thought
that ' s being  " trapped in culture "
what do you think ?
you can just trust me ok ?
i ' d sell long johns in cold countries
to people trapped in the culture of the cold climate
i didn ' t think that far
this is why you need me
the power of experience
is there no other way ?
mr kim is competent
you know that sir
i ' m responsible for what happened
it was just a mistake …
yes sir yes
please do what you can sir
thank you
bye
what happened ?
mr kwon is eloquent but he ' s in russia
mr oh
just go talk …
… to the executive director
what ?
what ?
what do you mean what ?
why don ' t you take the shortcut ?
you know all he has to do
is put in a word
-mr ko ! -the executive director …
yeah i know things aren ' t cool between you two
you need to swallow your pride this time
the executive director ?
ok forget it don ' t go
dong sik will just get a pay cut …
… and sent to the factory
he ' ll just have to sacrifice a promotion
yeah your pride is more important than your subordinate
i ' ll be the only one who knows you didn ' t do your best
why should i care about your team ?
what a pain in the neck
you know all he has to do is put in a word
yeah i know things aren ' t cool between you two
you need to swallow your pride this time
geu rae
did mr oh come back ?
he said he ' d return soon
yeah ?
then i ' ll go to kotra
ok
see you
-bye -bye
geu rae
let ' s go submit the presentation files we can go now
hello
jang geu rae and han suk yool
it ' s tomorrow finally
thank you
i thought about it
let ' s wrap it up in a sexier way
let ' s end it with a question
huh ?
what ?
you don ' t understand ?
i said  " sexy "  means  " uncommon "
not something everyone else does
we should end it with a meaningful question
an interview should convey …
that ' s what i ' m saying
you can infer his opinion through the question
so frustrating
let ' s think about the question
refer to some books
sure
ask me questions if any
sure
if you still need …
geu rae
mr oh
hello
i didn ' t get the meeting briefing
huh ?
i ' ll submit it soon
soon ?
how many times did i tell you not to
let the presentation disturb your work ?
i ' m sorry
you getting disregarded looks natural
why just say  " sure sure "  like that ?
are you dumb or do you lack will power ?
you told me to get into the center of the tornado
because the center is calm
i could suffer damage next to him
didn ' t you mean i should get inside if i can ' t move far away ?
although he makes me mad
i realized i need him
i have to acknowledge him
it ' s something i can ' t overlook with pride
i ' m sure of that
i ' m ashamed
but i have to survive for now
mr oh
he ' s not here
he went to the headquarters just now
-hello sir -hi
see you sir
oh are you ok ?
you should watch where you ' re going
your lower body is weak huh ?
lower body …
that ' s important for men
work out your lower body
run on the stairs from now on !
geu rae
yes ?
you dropped one
i ' m sorry
did you practice reading it ?
huh ?
practice it like you ' re making an announcement
it ' s different from just reading it to yourself
when you ' re nervous your breathing shakes
if you speak louder for others …
… you ' ll be out of breath
don ' t just rely on the mic
that ' s tougher
listen to your tense breath on the speakers
that ' ll make you even more nervous
if you time yourself it would be good too
listen to your tense breath on the speakers
that ' ll make you even more nervous
if you time yourself it would be good too
it will be nice and comfortable
see you on the rooftop
what ' s with him ?
mr choi ' s office
this is mr oh
is he in now ?
yes but he just left for the day
did you tell him i wanted to see him ?
yes i did
did he say anything ?
no he didn ' t
geu rae
what is it ?
how about practicing it out loud ?
we can record it and time ourselves
huh ?
why ?
it ' s mr oh ' s advice
it ' ll be helpful
it ' s ok
geez
i ' m in charge of the details
this is one of the details
did you forget i ' ll do the talking ?
let ' s do it
let ' s check the length since it ' ll be strict
so ?
will you shorten it if it ' s too long ?
we can ' t do that
i already memorized it
we can ' t change …
that will mess everything up
-we already submitted the slides -hey !
don ' t say whatever you want !
watch what you say
isn ' t it good to find issues beforehand ?
-mr oh … -mr oh …
the guy who ' s putting his responsibility on subordinates ?
what ?
why should he get in trouble for that ?
what happened to your team …
… is all mr oh ' s fault
we all know that
are you done ?
he comes and messes up all the files at our factory
how could a pro do that ?
i can ' t treat him like a boss
blood …
i told you to watch what you say
what do you know about my boss ?
we ' re both interns man !
what do you mean boss ?
you work here jerk ?
don’t talk to me like that idiot !
you don’t talk to me like that !
come here
it didn ' t hurt at all

i heard you were looking for me
you have something to say ?
i have a favor to ask you about my team
favor ?
what is it ?
regarding kim dong sik and the disciplinary committee
please reconsider it
please
let ' s go
unbelievable
the individual presentation is about revealing yourself
through your partner whether in a good way or bad way
if i accept my partner ' s suggestion it ' ll only make him good
if i refuse it ' ll make me look like so petty
but ?
geu rae you know me
i won ' t buy anything you sell me
i won ' t no matter what
i won ' t buy anything
this jerk doesn ' t care about his pettiness at all
what should i do ?
after the presentation topic was announced
we haven ' t been able to leave work
all the data is at work
and we can also see our other ' s process
some are already reading catalogues on items that ' d motivate your imagination
please let me think like an elementary school student
some surf the net to see if anything had anything similar
hi
you know someone who was in the same club as my partner right ?
some people use their connections
i can ' t treat him like a boss
does he value site experience ?
or does he hate office work ?
doesn ' t site work start from the office ?
young yi !
tell me your taste talent anything
-young yi ! -sang hyun
that ' s enough
i need this for my presentation
young yi !
say something ! young yi !
why didn ' t you just leave it alone ?
just a few months '  paycut doesn ' t ?
? mean i ' d be fired
who care if i ' m promoted a bit later ?
geez
just say  " sorry thank you "
i know how much you hate to ask him for favors
i don ' t know why i didn ' t check the verbal contract one more time
i ' m going nuts because i was aware of it
that ' s why it ' s a mistake
if you make the same mistake again that ' s the limit of yourself
i know
mr oh
thank you
also i ' m sorry
hi
hr called
i heard it ' ll be ok
yeah
-let ' s sit down -sure

i need your signature here
it also requires the signatures of upper management
so
i ' ll sell this pen which you can sign off the paper with
it ' s lacking
yeah
it ' s lacking
mr oh
you sound too desperate
it ' s not persuasive
i thought you left for the day
mr oh
isn ' t the office as important as the site ?
of course it is
right ?
i can ' t find a line to respond to site-oriented work
why would this big building be necessary ?
site work is completed in the office
i agree
there ' s no clear line between site and office for us
that ' s how it ' s like for trade you need both
you run around like crazy at the site
then you work like mad in the office
what ?
nothing
-see you tomorrow -bye
i found it
what time will it end ?
huh ?
how long is the test ?
i think past the afternoon
oh ?
why ' d you get so many ?
you said your back hurts
i think i ' m doing it ? you ' ll be doing it
you ' ll be jobless starting tomorrow
you want me to pass or not ?
it ' s ok either way
it ' s ok if i fail ?
if you pass i can ' t do public work
i won ' t be qualified
i ' m in an awkward position
i don ' t know whether to wish you ' d pass or fail

please be punctual
what ' s wrong ?
i didn ' t bring it

or this might be your final day
we need progressive people
with positive mindsets
anyways please do your best
for our company ' s future
first team jang gi suk and gu hyun wu please come out
hello
we ' re ready to leave a duck ' s footprint
on the international stage
so we applied for one international and ?
? we ' re jang gi suk ?
? and gu hyun wu
nice to meet you
we should ' ve used ideas like that
next
you think this is a play ?
get your clothes on and try again
oh mr kim how are things ?
well life isn ' t easy
we were team 1
thank you
where ' d you get the logo ?
uh ?
? it was captured
it was the only one available so gi suk did it
-but hyun wu ? -i ' m sorry about that
next
-but he ? -next
myanmar is in a location connecting china and india
ever since 2011 they ' ve been developing gradually
but crises can be categorized into risks ?
do you even know you ' re mixing risk and crisis ?
risk is the danger of loss
crisis is ?
team 3 ' s strategy is to secure the value chain through feed grains business for resources
we participate productions and secure procurement channels
our goal is to become a lead trader in food resources
it ' s nice
but you ' ll be more suited for an ad company ?
yes i too think ?
this center is expected to lead the steel industry
and the center of ukraine ' s strategic business and eastern europe
ok
how did you end up applying for our company ?
i was interested in trade
you worked for a trading company before
uh ?
? i went to community college
so i thought it wouldn ' t be competitive
so you thought you could make it here with your background
you went to community college but your gpa is good and you have talent
how can you be so unconfident ?
you want us to accept you or not ?
i ' m sorry
sorry about what ?
gosh
let me correct it
i never disregarded this company
that doesn ' t work
thinking that being honest will show the sincerity
people can become honest to give some excuses
regardless of the truth
next
regarding the development of solar energy
the costs haven ' t decreased
according to simulation results when we build 50k watt
-are you sick ? -don ' t talk to me
what ' s wrong ? will you be able to speak ?
-then we need to ? -i didn ' t say i couldn ' t
next ahn young yi and lee sang hyun
come on out
hello
i ' ll be giving a presentation on india ' s solar energy ipp business plan
i think we should expand value chains through networks and investments
and present plans to develop independent power producers
so i ' d like to present ways to enhance and specialize ipp
there are 3 ways to enhance ipp
if we acquire solar energy providing networks
it will naturally bring higher value
it will lead to better trading values
we can reinforce the epc and smart
manufacturing development and create synergy
you must be wondering why solar energy
this graph will explain that
she ' s really good
the solar energy ?
how can you secure materials in india ?
through materials such as ingot and wafer
a value chain will be secured
what about developing countries ?
polysilicone manufacturers ?
everything is going smooth for her
she ' s so solid about her opinion
she has guts
seok ho was good too
what about module manufacturers '  m&a ?
she ' s shady
huh ?
she ' s very shady
so module manufacturers '  m&a ?
? through previous referrals ?
? references to ?
? developed countries ?
what are previous references ?
belgium or japan ?
yes i ' ll tell you
so module manufacturers '  m&a ?
and previous references to work with developed countries
i ' ll explain briefly
he ' s making her look good now
solar energy attracts many attentions in the country
and the company infinity also has hundreds of plants in the philippines
he looks comfortable since he gave up
we analyzed the ranking index based on one international ' s values
and we found out we need to ?
? develop businesses and
? be flexible to changes and be creative
so we need to look at ibm ' s flexible new business strategy
they have a radical system crossnext for direct management and affiliates
this innovative idea ' s focus is on the process not the actual profits
he shows presentations textbook
his words are so clear
very logical
he ' s good
but he ' s only moving his brains
he needs to move people ' s hearts to sell
that ' s my presentation regarding
one international ' s future
thank you
i wonder how the test is going
gosh
he won ' t be shaking
he ' s used to it
it ' s nothing for him
next jang geu rae and han suk yool
jang geu rae ' s in your team ?
yes
don ? t touch me
suk yool
our presentation will be about
" trade trapped in culture "
it ' s about profit-generating strategies through countermining that
geu rae
what ' s with him ?
he must be very nervous
so our start is ?
hello ?
suk yool ?
he ' s not here now
he ' s taking his intern test
he ' s not here now
why ' s everyone looking for him ?
did you take your medication ?
what are you doing ?
breathe
you look sick
look up
don ' t sound like you ' re reading it
that ' s how we decided on our topic
-hey -huh ?
breathe
where ' s the fire ?
uh ?
i ' m sorry
i need more time
i ' ll go take my medication to calm myself
please
go take it
but i can ' t give you more time
the others won ' t want that
you have 7 more minutes left
i ' ll just ?
i ' ll do it
i ' ll do it
why that ?
explain it
why did you put that there ?
just because ?
there ' s no such thing as  " just because "
you need a plan for every move
that ' s called an intention
your top-right is blocked
what will you do about the crisis ?
get rid of unnecessary ones
get rid of what ?
eloquence
i ' ll get rid of the reason why i chose suk yool
being trapped in culture ?
? means you ' re trapped on ?
? in the customs locations
that ' s the limitation
why ' s he stammering ?
limitations of environment ?
come on
he won ' t make it
limitational ?
? limitations ?
this isn ' t working
i need more than ambition
geez
dad !
suk yool !
are you going to the factory ?
yeah i ' m starting the night shift
your hands are black
it ' s heavy grease
why ? are you embarrassed ?
no i ' m not embarrassed of you
my boy !
bye
you didn ' t hear the condition ?
the whole labor union will be laid off
suk yool !
my dad went to his office
your dad is home huh ?
you must be embarrassed
no i ' m not embarrassed
you must be embarrassed
geez
not making them want it is ?
? but making need it is our goal
so that is limitation so environment limits
he ' s probably taking his intern test
he won ' t pick up
yeah he ' s taking his intern test
i called too
he won ' t pick up
when does his test end ?
-he ' ll get an office job finally -he ' ll do good
we should help him leave the site
he has stage fright
he took his medication ?
there are no ?
? not many people ?
? in that region ?
? so containers aren ' t filled ?
- ? full ? -wait
it ' s all good but hard to listen to
you need to use more formal terms
not personal ones
don ' t you think it ' s no good ?
yeah ? i ' m sorry
have you been to the site ?
you need some creative input about the products
you haven ' t gone to the site did you ?
no
interns these days know nothing
you won ' t ask for a tour
you won ' t go if your boss doesn ' t
indeed ?
? the site is important
thanks
sorry for the trouble
i ' ll continue
dad i ' m not ashamed of you ?
? or the site
you need to check cases where fcl doesn ' t work
fulfilling conditions with forwarding agents are key
lcl or air transport is possible
you can send a small quantity to the consumer directly that way
when people die in northern russian
it was suk yool ' s time
his presentation was smooth and flawless with terms used on sites
the executives from the site looked impressed
will ancients be able to come ?
he was making up for the time he lost with his eloquence
he took control
he knew what he was doing
he took full control that ' s it
let me conclude
now he had become a male young yi
he changed into a pro from a conman in 3 minutes
good job
gosh
it was so tough
the executive director was so intimidating
wasn ' t young yi amazing ?
gosh
young yi !
don ' t you want coffee ? young yi !
he needs to sell
baek ki was great
i think young yi was best after seok ho
wasn ' t young yi amazing ?
don ' t let them hear you
anyway she ' s a girl
suk yool was good
young yi was like a pro
i liked geu rae ' s paper and presentation
too bad
it was a good chance
that ' s his limit
it ' s a miracle he came here
i liked how he didn ' t go on
you ' re saying that on purpose
don ' t do that
ultimately ?
? it ' ll harm you
what are you saying ?
we think our past is holding onto us
but it ' s the other way around
that ' s how you look now
why you ?
why should a married woman look at a married man ?
don ' t look down on me just because you got promoted earlier
you still think you ' re a hottie
yeah
how was geu rae ?
no way
he was a moron
huh ?
i knew young yi was a pro
mr oh come on
i ' ll go to ijin chemicals
ok !
trip him if you can ' t make it
huh ?
you ' ll at least get the pleasure of seeing him trip
huh ?
the second presentation interview will start
as we ' ve told you
you ' ll have to sell to your partner and why ?
that will be fun won ' t it ?
if you reject without a good reason your score will be deducted
i bought this for $600 in hong kong
i ' ll sell it to you for $350
i won ' t buy it
that ' s no good reason
this belt is korean but a great imitation ?
you love name brands
you need a wallet ?
i think korean product quality is better
you like foreign name brands
you bragged about buying nice used items
what ' s with him ?
used items is discovering resources too
you ' re talented jong min
you ' re also diligent
but you lack confidence
that ' s because you don ' t have anything original
you ' re the brand jong min
don ' t imitate others
buy this mirror to build ?
? you own originality
i don ' t imitate others
what ' s that ?
the item i ' ll try to sell you is invaluable
you can give me however much you want
i ' ll sell an exclusive
memory for young yi
this is a day in one international
intern ahn young yi ' s life
gosh
jang geu rae and han suk yool please prepare
go ahead
han suk yool will start
this is what i ' ll sell to jang geu rae
here
these are the fabrics we ' re making in ulsan
these are various synthetic fibers in
including nylon and polypropylene
they are creating high value
in the 21st century
one more thing
this is a book of work environments ?
losses due to mistakes in orders ?
? and analysis of miscommunication
i ' ll sell this site info to you
make up your mind geu rae
i hope there are no issues
of course not
then ?
? i will just buy the book
the fabric ?
? i won ' t take
why not ?
the book has your analysis
so it will save my time
the fabric can be acquired anytime
i don ' t need to buy yours
he ' s good
you don ' t know what you ' re talking about
all of this fabric was made
through my sweat and tears
they ' re made through a pro ' s expertise
i had to put up with being called a  " dog "  and  " pervert "
dog ?
he knew that ?
oh my !
still it ' s a crime to touch a woman ' s butt without permission
i didn ' t touch her butt
i was touching the fabric
-i ? -you might ' ve been touching the fabric
at the same time you ' re admitting you did touch her
he ' s funny
the fabric i wanted to touch ?
? happened to be on her butt
you saw it
i did
you touched her butt
ok
calm down
what will you do geu rae ?
will you buy it or not ?
if i had to study
and build expertise like him to sell fabric ?
? then ?
? i ' d sell it with him
if we both make it and come here
will you sell it with me ?
what will you do suk yool ?
will you sell it with him ?
that ?
? depends on his item
cunning fellow
interesting
go ahead
yes sir
yeah show it to me
whatever you sell
what is he holding ?
i ' ll sell this work slipper to him
where is my slipper ?
where is my slipper ?
-you don ' t have one either ? -no
what ' s that ?
this is mr oh ' s slipper
that ' s mine
maybe not
look at his shoes
that crazy ?
they ' re clean
office workers need to be
neat since we meet clients
most of the work is done in the office
look at his slipper again
what ' s he doing ?
it ' s worn out
you can see for yourself
that dirty ?
you can smell the sweat too
the smell of sweat
it means the office is part of the site
i ' ll sell the
combat boot of the office
again wow
awesome
i won ' t buy it
the office is not part of the site
do you even know what the site is ?
the site employees get laid off so easily ?
by office workers who just sign a document !
you want to see their combat boot ?
they wear construction boots
to protect their feet in case heavy tools fall
that ' s what you call combat boots
i won ' t buy yours
you ' ve always emphasized the site
you ' ve only emphasized the site
you must be all about how the
machines work to make products
you must be thinking about your
expertise and experience in contests in the field
what contest ?
you won a contest ?
i won contests ?
but ?
? we take the crowded subway every day for work
we check the foreign currency rate every day
we try to prevent mistakes made by a single digit
we check legal documents for a single sentence
will you take responsibility ?
we don ' t just sign a document
you can ' t do this now
there are tons of dialogue
you also feel small in the process
sometimes we stay up all night for foreign countries to get a single okay
the items made at the site start to exist ?
? after the process of validating why they should be made
they can ' t exist without going through the office
there ' s no meaningless move
there ' s no meaningless product made by the company
the reason a stone gets in trouble is
because you ' ve failed to see intentions
the reason a product fails is because
you ' ve failed to see ahead and plan
when it ' s in trouble just let it die
but you should use them to your benefit
when a product is a failure just let it fail
but you should use it to make a better product
the office and site are mutually connected
there may be mistakes between them
but if you look at the big picture ?
? we ' re all aiming for the same goal of benefits
the site in my mind is not
different from the one you do
applause
geu rae
who is it ?

here you go
here
thank you
wait
yes

mom

hello sir
young yi !
i feel like i ' ll have a great day thanks to you
good morning
hi
good morning
you ' re running late today
am i ?
no you ' re usually 30 minutes earlier than us
i had to take my kid to daycare
my husband is working now
-hello geu rae and young yi -hello
you know ms sun from sales team 1 ?
she ' s a true pro
until young yi came
she ' s the most popular employee whom guys want to drink with
by the way i ' m the least popular
you ' re the #1 employee they want to work with
by the way i ' m the least popular again
we entered the company together
but she ' s climbing the ladder faster than me
you ' re doing job training today ?
yes
she ' s the toughest working
woman here and she ' s respected
teach them a good lesson
when ' s loading ?
next month around the 15th
what ' s the penalty fee if that ' s changed ?
penalty …
taking memos is good
but you should thoroughly understand current contracts
i ' m sorry
are you gonna check your note in front the buyer too ?
no sir
from now on …
… for each contract you give to dong sik and me …
… give me a summary of where you ' re sending what and when
yes sir
oh yeah
did you finish the resources transfer ?
i sent it yesterday
i get more suspicious when he ' s so chirpy
where are the approval conditions ?
da 91 sir
what about joshua ' s mistake ?
myanmar case ?
ok
the last one is turkmenistan ?
yes
let ' s see
how come there ' s only a b/l draft ?
the bill is issued to the shipper …
huh ?
you didn ' t get the official b/l from sales team 3 ?
well
i knew it
oh sang sik
-you ' re in trouble -huh ?
where ' s the original b/l ?
well …
he didn ' t write the company name seller and buyer info …
and got profits in his pocket without the original
call him now
huh ?
now !
yes
uh mr oh
about the one on turkmenistan
how come there ' s only a b/l draft ?
what ?
where ' s the original b/l ?
huh ?
sorry won ' t cut it
mr jung
what ?
a newbie did it ?
hey !
train them well
don’t let it happen again
what did he say ?
he said he ' s sorry
hello ?
shall i go there or you want to come here ?
shall i go ?
you ' re with mr ma aren ' t you ?
hello
hi
hey
what ' s wrong with you ?
why ' d you put in the b/l draft ?
i gave you the b/l two months ago !
no you didn ' t
we never got it
i know you and mr ma
aren ' t you even embarrassed ?
what ?
even if you ' re scared of mr ma you should take responsibility !
how ' d you get to that position ?
what ' s wrong with you ?
you ' re the one who didn ' t take responsibility !
what ?
it just ends with my being embarrassed
there was no death like someone
mr jung
oh …
what did you just say ?
let him go
what ?
let go
let him go
what you want to hit me ?
go ahead
-come on -here
oh gosh
come on let ' s have another funeral
mr jung !
mr oh !
what are you doing ?
why ' d you hit him ?
if they said the b/l is missing you should check and solve the issue !
are you a kid ?
how can you hit him first
sang sik
hey !
i ' m sorry
it ' s ok
nothing for you to apologize about
the turkmenistan one is from two months ago
i ' m sure i gave mr oh the bill before i went on my business trip
the meticulous man couldn ' t have forgotten to give it over
why did mr jung have to bring up the past ?
who died ?
yun jae he died
what happened ?
was it a suicide ?
any will ?
were there any rumors that could give us trouble ?
was there anything about me ?
that jerk
he acts all noble and hides when he ' s cornered ?
he ' s not in the place to hit people
he only put in the b/l draft
where ' s the original b/l ?
he said he gave it to us
that jerk needs to be embarrassed to wake up
what ' s going on with the b/l ?
i don ' t know
i don ' t care anymore now
hey !
what ' s wrong with you ?
so mr oh really could ' ve given it over
why ' d you have to bring all this chaos when you ' re not sure ?
that ' s not the issue here
we weren ' t going to make the b/l a big issue
he just went to ask and he hit him
he threw him in front of everyone
that shows how mr oh disregards our team
that ' s why i ' m saying sorry
why should you be sorry ?
the guy who hit him should be
he should give an official apology to the one he hit
ok
alright
and …
… tell him to upload an apology on the company intranet
no way mr ma !
are you trying to embarrass mr oh ?
he needs to be embarrassed
last year because of him i …
anyway if he doesn ' t do it i ' ll make this a bigger issue
what will you do ?
what will you do ?
tell them it ' s bullshit
mr oh !
hey !
is mr jung ok ?
yes
he ' s not hurt
mr oh said he ' s sure he sent it
i can ' t look for it
i know
what are you two so serious about ?
you don’t want the training ?
geu rae i heard there was some fun on your floor
oh i heard news about mr oh just the other day
i ' m sorry about what i said about him on the rooftop
by the way my friend
i could see why he got upset
he has a story
i was told that in the past mr oh …
nice to meet you
sit down
i ' m sun ji young from sales team 1
and i ' ll be in charge of training
nice to meet you
i ' m sure you ' ve seen the emails i sent out
what i sent …
what i sent is feedback
from our business partners …
i have a funeral to attend
pick up so mi from the daycare honey
it shows how sales team 1 and one international work hard …
… on client care and contract management
let ' s see how important document
communication is through your emails
-it ' s all a strategy you know -huh ?
they don’t give you work right ?
they want to show who ' s boss in the beginning
that ' s what mr song said
it ' s all because you ' re talented
so keep your chin up
young yi ' s luckier since you have work at least
it ' s tough to get adjusted to resources
they don ' t know how to become friends with women
but i ' m loved by bosses
hello sir
is training over young yi ? run here now
i ' ll be right over
i ' ll get going
my boss always needs me
oh dear
hello sir
sir
you think you ' re above meetings ?
gosh the meeting with me was nothing to you ?
you didn ' t say it was urgent
so i was going to go after finishing the proposal
accounting said they need it by today for setting budgets
then you should ' ve pulled an all-nighter
what will you do about the meeting on company selection ?
this is why i can ' t work with women
no sense of sacrifice
what can i expect ?
why are you so stiff ?
aren ' t you going to say you ' re sorry ?
i ' m sorry
go get out of my face
you can take her there before you leave
leave it to your mother or whatever
it ' s what we promised
are you the only one who works ?
it ' s the meeting i postponed a week because of you
i can ' t postpone it again
never mind i have to go out for work now
i ' m sorry about that
it ' s ok
is something wrong ?
your eyes are red
it ' s ok
oh my
thanks
so mi ' s mother
so mi forgot to take this yesterday
yes thanks
see you …
your child must have drawn it
but there ' s no face
she didn ' t finish it i guess
why do you keep looking at me ?
huh ?
i asked why do you keep looking at me ?
sorry
are you at your seat ?
can i go see you now ?
you know …
… i didn ' t finish what i was saying
actually you won ' t feel good about this
sit down
someone died because of mr oh
stop looking over
-take care of this -sure
that ' s nonsense !
sit sit
it was when he was an assistant manager
something his subordinate did went wrong
mr oh must ' ve been at fault too
mr oh ignored him
when he resigned
the subordinate opened a small shop with his mother
but …
… he died in an accident making a delivery
so they ' re saying it wouldn ' t have happened
if mr oh had taken responsibility
go
i ' m going
-ok -go
mr oh is something else
this is so wrong of him
mr oh wouldn ' t avoid responsibility
you never know about people
who wants to get fired ?
sir
chemicals is really being stubborn
you asked for mr oh ' s help before
now you want us out ?
so don ' t you know what we went through
for the japan and china cases and meet with them ?
hey ! give it !
-give it over ! -no that won ' t solve it
this is too much …
hey take it !
how can you just give it over ?
this has to do with our performance
we did all the work and you want to give them the benefits ?
how could you let that happen ?
mr oh ! please !
uh …
they ' re thinking whatever they want
why won ' t you say something ?
what are they thinking wrong ?
the executive director signed a contract with a bad company
you know it was an absurd contract
you know everyone knew it was a bad company
i heard he even got a commission
while eun jae took all the blame !
his death has nothing to do with you so just tell them the truth !
nothing will change whether it was my fault or his
that time …
… i didn ' t take the responsibility
how i didn ' t say i would take responsibility …
… won ' t change
mr oh
mr oh
how many people could take responsibility in that situation ?
everyone would ' ve done the same
let ' s go
we need to prepare for the training meeting
why eun jae ?
if not him will you take responsibility ?
will you do that ?
daycare centers only open until 6 pm
we can ' t ask them to understand again
soo jin
oh my !
are you ok ?
soo jin
get up soo jin
come on let ' s move her to the nursing room
hey help her
-are you ok ? -soo jin
she ' s pregnant and she must have overworked herself
what ?
pregnant ?
yes she needs rest
hey did you know that ?
no
geez how many kids is she having ?
didn ' t you say she has two kids ?
yes
why ' d she get pregnant again ?
she ' s so selfish
move !
she got pregnant again ?
another leave ?
we covered so much for her after the first and second kids
when will we train the employees and all ?
i busted my behind after she had her second kid
gosh we ' ll have to borrow other team members
geez
women are always the problem
after all that studying they get married have pregnant a husband …
they have so many excuses
or they try to get a quick fix by crying
that ' s because they ' re unloyal
do your work
ms sun
thank you
soo jin ' s been working overtime for the whole week
i wonder why she didn’t tell us
she couldn ' t have
third kid is tough
times have changed but working
and taking care of kids is hard
working moms are always at fault
to the company to in-laws …
… and of course the kid
it ' s impossible without the husband ' s help
if you want to continue working don’t get married
it will save you trouble
-mr kim -yeah
time for the meeting
ok
-i wish he wouldn ' t come -huh ?
oh nothing
mr oh
regarding the resources takeover case …
how about not joining that one ?
why not ?
i ' m aware of everything so i won ' t make any mistakes
each team will hand in the reports
our team will give you a report
regarding the indonesia case when we ' re ready
you ' re aware it will take 2-3 days to receive a reply right ?
i hope resources can give us some more time
we ' ll take it you ' ll give us 2-3 days and wrap it up
fine
the other teams can just do your data organization
sometimes they keep calling us
take care of that mr ha
sure
sir
i think we can wrap it up
how can we wrap it up ?
there ' s no b/l
sir you can talk about that later …
you really won ' t give it over ?
i told you it ' s been given over
what company is in on this too ?
how much did you pocket ?
sir
you know mr oh wouldn ' t do that
you be quiet
women should know their place
sir
then you should ' ve talked to me in private
what ?
why aren ' t you apologizing ?
why won ' t you upload it ?
since there ' s nothing to apologize about
why not ?
after hitting a man ?
gosh
you ' ve aged but you ' re still irresponsible
still
excuse me ?
irresponsible …
what do kids say this days ?
ir …
-irresman -yeah
the irresman is evolving by the day
this isn ' t about what happened last year is it ?
what ?
what are you talking about ?
the complaint regarding your sexual harassment issue
what ?
when i stood witness
hey oh sang sik !
why bring that up here ?
and sexual harassment ?
why ' s that sexual harassment ?
she shouldn ' t have worn that low-cut shirt
did i touch or look inside ?
" if you ' re going to hide yourself each time you bend over why ' d you wear that ?
just let it all hang out "
is that sexual harassment ? that ' s sexual harassment ?
that was sarcasm
i meant don ' t wear such stuff
" there ' s nothing worth seeing "
you added that
so …
… is that sexual harassment ?
asking them for a cup of coffee is too
worrying they can ' t get married is too
i hate all these tough women !
young yi
you tell me
is that sexual harassment ?
is it ?
why can ' t you answer me ?
i think it is …
… if the person who heard it …
… was sexually offended
what ?
hey !
what did you just say ?
where are you going ?
you told me to write an apology !
i ' m going to do that !
you should wrap things up in there
yes
i ' m going nuts
an apology ?
you read each word carefully
i ' m sure he ' ll say something wrong
yes
let ' s go there ' s a meeting with a client
gosh
that jerk
geez
mr ma got in trouble for sexual harassment ?
he got a pay cut for 3 months for it
mr oh stood witness for it ?
mr oh is hard to understand too
he stands for justice in times like that
he ' s so different in his situations it ' s hard to understand
geez
he ' s good at work though
wrap it up
mr kang
wait up
i wonder where the b/l went
mr oh is amazing
he ' s just insisting he gave it when they say they didn’t receive it
he ' s saying he gave it since he did
so where is it ?
you mean resources is lying ?
we were interns two months ago
baek ki
you were an intern there right ?
yes
you didn ' t see it ?
no
baek ki
what is it ?
the b/l
you really didn ' t see it then ?
i said i never saw it why ?
you were working there so i was wondering if you did
what are you trying to say ?
i worked there so i should know ?
do you know all about your team ?
why don ' t you go dig through the files ?
no need to drag me into this
baek ki
there ' s a b/l from the sales team 3 on the desk
bring that over
you really never saw it ?
why do you keep asking ?
you never saw it ?
it ' ll be better if you didn ' t know if i did or not
what are you saying ?
if i say i did will you tell sales team 3 ?
think about your position
if that ' s revealed how do you think resources will treat you ?
it ' s like pouring gas over fire
why do that ?
mr oh won ' t take your side just because you help sale team 3
-baek ki -this isn ' t your business
you ' re in resources
that ' s reality
mr oh is a true man
oh my !
geu rae
read it

sorry
all of it
sorry

it ' s ok
mr kim !
sit down
i ' ll go to accounting
ok
geu rae
get me some water
ok
oh those jerks …
sir sir ?
those jerks
they ' re trying to threaten us by hurting themselves now ?
they ' re like gangsters
don’t ever work with sales team 3 again
sir let ' s wrap it up
mr oh must ' ve learned his lesson
give me my glasses
uh …
geez
young yi bring me some coffee
sure
what will we do ?
the issue is getting bigger
why didn ' t you just say it when he signed it ?
you should have honestly said it was left out
hey our boss wasn ' t being told off for once and i couldn ' t say that
also mr oh is all worked up
i couldn ' t do that
what will we do ?
shall we shred it ?
if dong sik asks for me tell him i went for a smoke
sure
mr oh wouldn ' t miss a b/l
who cares if he ' s good ?
you can ' t do anything about newbies
you ' re right
he won ' t know what b/ls and drafts are
sales team 3 is in the mr choi ' s
bad book and they ' re treated poorly
they have the worst seats and few employees
that ' s why they have such a newbie
mr oh
why aren ' t you working ?
i have a question
you have a light ?
no sir
men should know how to smoke
i used to smoke 3 packs a day when i was your age
and you don ' t know the basic
you should have a lighter to serve others
i ' m sorry
what ' s your question ?
uh …
the b/l
is there any possibility you gave it and i missed it ?
huh ?
so …
… are you covering for me …
no right
go do your work !
geu rae
hi
-make two copies and file them -yes
mr kim
what ?
how long do you keep received b/ls ?
why ? you want to look for it ?
shall i ?
no way
you want to go search another team ' s stuff ?
that ' s nonsense
if it was possible i would ' ve done it already
-hurry up with that -yes
what was he talking about ?
about b/l …
i hope he doesn ' t search resources
he can ' t be that stupid
look
yes
bring this for the buyer meeting
yes
again ?
we postponed it last week
i know
delay it for just 3 hours
i ' m sorry
ok
sign this
sure
you ' re picking up your kid ?
your parents can ' t ?
right
i have to leave her with my in-laws
i ' m a guy too but guys think
girls should give in all the time
they don ' t know how hard girls
have to work to climb up the ladder
that too
i know
that ' s why my wife stopped working too
you have three kids
if not i would ' ve quit
what ' s he doing ?
good job
about keeping silent
geu rae
why are you lurking around resources ?
were you looking for the b/l ?
no sir
then why ' d you go there ?
did you go to see young yi ?
come here
did you ask young yi ?
no i …
why didn ' t you ask her ?
should i ask her ?
no way !
who told you to lurk around there ?
don ' t you have work to do ?
i ' m sorry
-geu rae -huh ?
not you
go on a business trip if you ' re so idle
huh ?
ms sun
this isn ' t right
it ' s ok
no
it could become a problem if a subordinate gets involved in personal issues
hold on
mr oh geu rae …
it ' s ok
i don ' t want him to cause accidents here
i can ' t be any more embarrassed
mr oh is really doing things his way today
thanks
no problem
meeting a client ?
yes
i ' m going for ms sun ' s child
huh ?
that ' s good
i ' ll see you tomorrow
geu rae
is mr oh ok ?
huh ?
mr oh shouldn ' t have brought
up what happened before
he should respect people have
things they don’t want brought up again
i understand why mr oh got that mad
he ' s not mad now
he ' s blaming himself
most bad choices become regrets and get forgotten
but not always
some things haunt you forever
they don’t get forgotten
and you can ' t take them back
he ' s blaming himself
he looks lonely to me
i came to get so mi
yes
i got a call from so mi ' s mother
let ' s go home so mi
ok
alright
they ' re in the all-day class
their mothers will come soon
where ' s my mom ?
she ' ll come soon
let ' s go wait inside
let ' s go
can they play with me in the playground ?
we have to be with them as guardians
the teacher will go home soon and i have to work
i ' ll stay with them
i ' ll just go home late
the flower has bloomed
the flower has bloomed
the flower has bloomed
the flower has bloomed
come on
1 2 3
nice you ' re fast
nice
hello
let ' s go home
let ' s go home
bye
bye
bye
up you go
some things haunt you forever
they don’t get forgotten
and you can ' t take them back
we ' ll take care of that oh !
i ' ll call you back
thanks
is everyone gone ?
they went to the buyers '  meeting
i ' ll carry some
thanks
resources is tough isn ' t it ?
it ' s always been tough for women
they always discriminate between the genders
but only elites go there
you ' re hanging in there very well
it ' s not that easy
right ?
uh ms sun …
i have a question
sure
there ' s something i should do and i know it ' s right
i ' m hesitant about it though
why ?
it might complicate things
does it have to do with resources ?
does ignoring something that ' s right
make things more simple ?
at least you can avoid criticism
it ' s because i ' m a girl …
i don ' t know what it is
what does gender have to do with what ' s right ?
it has to do with …
… your conscience
regarding conscience …
everyone knows
there are people who don ' t do it when they know …
… those who do because they know
geu rae
sorry
for telling you now
it would ' ve been better if i ' d brought the b/l
but i couldn ' t possibly do that
anyway i ' m in resources
yes
it ' s in the bottom file box
this is the cabinet number
i ' ll take care of so mi
thank you
who are you ?
i ' m so mi ' s teacher

i know the b/l is here
what are you saying ?
where is sang sik ?
he went home after asking his subordinate to steal ?
i ' ll make sure he can ' t work here again
where is he ? tell him to come now
tell him to come now jerk !
ha !
the guy with no connection brings in this guy
through nepotism and makes him steal ?
hey
the guy with no connections is here
what are you doing ?
i ' ve been respecting you
you want to be embarrassed in front of a newbie ?
or you want to go to the rooftop ?
how do we know if it ' s from you or us ?
we don ' t
but you and i know

someone knows it ' s from resources

oh it ' s nice
what will happen to dong sik ?
-he has a ged -i heard there ' s a lot to learn from you
i said one thing do it the right way
-i ' m stupid -fool
gather all the teams now
i ' ll be waiting …
i was the first person to arrive at work
it felt great to be the only one there
it was because it felt like i opened the door
a stationery shop owner from when i was a kid always …
opened the place and cleaned the front
hello
hi going to school ? i loved how the clean alley felt
i started the day going past it
it felt great opening the door and start the day like him
i checked various notice boards
i read news articles of various themes through the intranet
there was an appropriate amount of tension and ease of mind
it was just like a stylish drama scene
oh it ' s not that data ?
oh we sent the wrong one
until my immediate boss came to work
i have a file in excel so i ' ll send it right away
bye
mr song
i ' m working on the report now
i ' ll call you back

this is totally worth it !
congratulations !
you said that tie was from your kids and it ' s really amazing
you owe it to that
hey
i ' ll treat you to a cup of coffee
let ' s go geu rae
gosh
hey hello
i knew he was referring to this as a  " treat "
that ' s why i ' m making it myself
this is a golden ratio you know
thank you
we just have to take care of wilmart now
yes
here it ' s hot
be careful
drink up
why can ' t you come when you passed the cycle test ?
the data isn ' t that hard to receive !
i think
the cost is a bigger issue
did you show them the appropriate price ?
if you consider the production cost and general expenses that ' s reasonable !
yes but they think it ' s unreasonable
hey !
i told you to fix your attitude
we can ' t sell anything like that
what can we live on if we satisfy all their needs ?
you have a problem
will you be on our side ?
why always work on theirs ?
i ' ll keep an eye on the guam one
geez
why ' d you have to ruin the mood here ?
that ' s mr park in it who ' s a nice guy
of course
he ' s a great employee who cooperates well with the client
you two go for job training to that team don ' t you ?
yes oh yes
mr lee who just left will lead us
what ?
rubber trees ?
this is about siberia ' s forests !
dang

you copy/pasted the indonesian document right ?
i used mr ha ' s document for an mou
i got it mixed up with the indonesian one
i ' m sorry i ' ll redo it how ?
how will you redo it ?
the legal team is done reviewing it
how will you redo it ?
why ?
will you go to sales team 3 to ask for the legal team to review it ?
tell me
aren ' t you going to respond ?
i heard you told them about the b/l
if you did you ought to have been quiet as an apology
what ?
" i told them "  ?
are you kidding me ?
you think that ' ll change anything ?
do you any good ?
that ' s why i don ' t trust women
hey
you don ' t even need to be here
go back to your seat
now !
hey !
take this
you should revise your mistakes !
hello mr oh
gosh young yi is in deep trouble because of the b/l
she ' s a cool woman
i don’t know if she ' s loyal or not
anyway …
… she ' s like me something else
right now …
man i can ' t believe this …
hello my senior
what ' s with you ?
you learned at ulsan and i learned at jeonju
we have nothing to do with each other
we have different academy owners
do we really have to do this ?
why do we always have to suffer ?
are you talking about the wilmart ramen case ?
they said if sales team 3 solves that
sales teams 1 2 ' s work will go smoothly
that ramen case doesn ' t really help sales team 3 ' s performance
sales team 3 suffers and sales teams 1 2 gets the credit
yet you have to pull it off
it ' s discouraging isn ' t it ?
-yeah -there ' s no word from wilmart
is there anything you don ' t know ?
no there isn ' t suk yool
get going
ok
alright see you later
geu rae

i ' ll try contacting the pipe exporting companies
i told you there ' s nothing you can do
i ' ll try it first how ?
i ' ll search … i don ' t need your help
mr kang
mr park
the electric wheelchair one …
why ' d you discontinue it ?
i said i ' d review it if you could get accurate profits calculated
not this company
it ' s a small company
but r&d is under way so if you work …
we can ' t connect clients not knowing
the profit-to-investment ratio
i told you many times
still you know …
i ' ll call the company again
ok
i ' ll return some books
return mine too
mr park
yes how ' s that case going ?
what did they say ?
don ' t you know the buyer is bugging me ?
yes i ' ll call them again
you keep calling with no results !
i ' m sorry
don ' t be on the phone all day run over there !
resolve the issue
yes sir
oh sorry mr park !
i was about to call you
you didn ' t have to come here
sun young coffee
i ' m sorry
when will the delayed item issue be resolved ?
we ' re securing goods in stock so wait 2-3 days
you said that last time
if you say that again i ' ll get in trouble
i ' m sure you have your reasons but … sorry
actually my daughter got into a car accident
huh ?
was she hurt badly ?
no
she was but she ' ll be ok
anyway i ' ll do my best to resolve your issue
sorry well
i ' m sure the shipping issue will be resolved
you didn ' t do it on purpose
anyway i ' m worried about your daughter
you must be concerned
yeah …
yes sir
i just met with him
he hadn ' t checked the items for guangzhou
they ' re securing goods in stock
so ?
i asked them to hurry up with it and …
what ' s wrong with you ?
if you went all the way there you should have brought up freight compensation …
so they can understand this issue
don’t come back until you resolve it !
yes
how did it go ? i heard it went smoothly
then why is there no call ?
don ' t worry he ' s his friend
he said to trust him
don ' t you think this is too much ?
you made us become scapegoats
stop bugging us
one international jang geu rae speaking
wilmart purchasing team ?
hold on i ' ll put mr oh on
oh sang sik speaking
yes
yes
ok
dude …
friend ?
i thought he was your friend !
you shouldn ' t have said it then
we would ' ve made a different strategy if you hadn ' t
you totally ruined it all !
what are you going to do now ?
you said we can trust you !
what are you going to do now ?
you said we could have trust
you said he ' s your friend and we could have trust no ?
what ' s this now ?
mr oh say something
what ' s the reason ?
you don’t like the delivery conditions ?
no those are great
our company never had intentions to begin with
we thought it lacked marketability
then why ' d you waste time if that ' s the case ?
you used to take my side dishes before
what ?
i ' m just kidding
you have something against me ?
no we ' re not kids
i used to a long ago
so …
… what about the past ?
we ' re not kids
i ' m not going into that
i ' ll say it so you understand
you might not know but i used to kiss up to you
what ?
so i just wanted you to kiss up for once
what ?
see you at the class reunion
bye buddy !
dang !
he must be so disappointed
you know when it ' s toughest when doing sales ?
when ?
having to entertain someone you know personally
what ' s tougher is …
… having to entertain a friend
entertaining
someone inevitably happens in a vertical dynamic
it ' s more embarrassing since it ' s your friend
then you wonder if it ' s all worth it
honey
you know right ?
my college friend sung sik
he quit
went to graduate school and now works for a good company
maybe i should …
what ?
huh ?
you already registered ?
geez
i wanted to talk with you about it first
me ?
oh …
i ' ll have a shot with sung sik before i go
yeah
ok
sung sik
do you like working there ?
but
what did you do
about your place when you were preparing for grad school ?
living expenses must have been tough
if you want to do something just think of yourself<u></u>
there ' s no choice that will satisfy everyone
take responsibility for your choice
i ' m happy …
i ' m happy but …
i don ' t want to go home
it ' s stressful …
… at home
ok
call me when you resolve it
mr park
yes sir
we ' re in charge of newbie training
there ' s a subcontractor trip set up so you take charge
huh me ?
it ' s mr park now ?
ok
yes sir
hey !
we can ' t sell anything like that
geu rae
go clear away the paper on the rooftop
if you want to do something just think of yourself
oh
hello
hi
you ' re mr park in it sales right ?
yes
i ' m newbie jang geu rae in sales team 3
i ' ll be going to the subcontractor trip with you
i see
gosh
unlike other bosses
i won ' t be of much help
mr oh said i can learn a lot from you
he said you set a great example with the clients
me ?
what else …
… did he say ?
huh ?
you ' re considerate of the interests among companies
he said …
an iron hand in a velvet glove
that ' s essential for sales
yeah ?
then shall i tell you about sales on the way ?
huh ?
there are many funny stories
i said i ' d drive
it ' s ok
it ' s best that i do it i know the way
where was i ?
sales are like a war
you need guts
you should think you ' d lose if you get behind
there are tons of painful and
victorious experiences
once the client couldn ' t meet the delivery deadline
all the upper management came and pleaded
" if you overlook it it will be fine so please "
and ?
i said firmly
" let ' s do it by the book "
you ' re a true business man
yeah
maybe that was too big of a lie
but i feel great
it ' s our client and they ' re working with a chinese semiconductor firm
but some problems have occurred recently
what ' s that ?
delivery keeps being delayed
they said they don ' t have goods in stock
maybe they have another client
usually the existing client thinks they ' re safe
no not this firm
they ' ve built trust with me
we need to visit once in a while
for good tension
we ' re busy now so leave one international for now
they ' re new so manage them well
try to hold out
with one international on the phone as long as possible
mr park ?
he ' s soft so he ' s not much of a problem
geez
so i ' ll carry on with that
it ' ll be awesome
mr park
so they think of us as a pushover
mr park we ' ll go back to the office
oh ok
sorry
geu rae
i ' m sorry
go back
i ' ll stay a bit longer
geu rae let ' s talk
what ?
geu rae i think we should go now
mr park was so perplexed
and the training isn ' t over
there ' s nothing we can do for him here
the site trip is meaningless too now
do whatever you want i ' ll get going
i ' ll get going mr park
sure
yeah
they think of us as a pushover
me and …
… the company
i wasn ' t cut out for this work to begin with
mr park
are you done talking ?
i better resign
why didn ' t you call me in advance ?
where did the other man go ? he had to go back to the office
yeah ?
let ' s go in uh …
when will you resolve our issue ?
right away !
of course !
i talked with you on the phone !
i ' m a fool
yes you ' re right we talked on the phone
sorry
i was going to resolve it first
but choices increased because of new businesses
let ' s leave
you ' re considerate of the interests among companies
i said firmly
" let ' s do it by the book "
show him what you got
show him
show him what you got
it was all lie though
there ' s no choice that will satisfy everyone
take responsibility for your choice
did i want to become a nice guy who never complains ?
did i ever take responsibility at the workplace ?
sir mr park
we made a mistake
we ' ll take care of it now
ok ? will it be ok …
… to do it by the book ?
if i don ' t do it now …
… it ' ll be the same wherever i go
i have nothing to say mr park
i ' m really sorry
i ' ll fix it today …
… and make sure it leaves incheon tomorrow
i told you we ' ll do it by the book
mr park
it ' s my fault
it ' s all my fault
we ' ve worked with one international for years
mr park we go way back with your boss
we have a long history
wouldn ' t it be a waste for that trust to be broken ?
let ' s keep things positive
let ' s make things smooth
this is how they treat me
i was such a pushover to them
you ' ve already embarrassed me enough
how low will you drag me ?
mr park
i ' m sorry
despite our long history we made a mistake
you wanted to do it by the book
what do you mean by that ?
contract termination or compensation ?
i ' ll …
… discuss that with the headquarters and let you know
why are you so foolish ?
you wanted to make a few bucks
so you become enemies with our old partner ?
what will you do ?
because of me …
… a partner relationship of 10 years is going to break
i should have just overlooked it
we ' re about to lose a precious client because of you !
uh …
today sir …
i ' ve never been this embarrassed in my life !
a move you make when things don ' t look good
are you crazy about money ?
the move you make to turn the tables …
you love money ? … is called a clever move …
… in the game of go
geez if the clever move was brilliant …
i ' m sorry … it proves they had the upper hand
calm down
mr park didn ' t think it would come to this
the reason they were shocked and continued to persuade him …
… is because mr park wasn ' t like this before
it ' s like they ' re looking one way or another
he ' s looking at them but he ' s criticizing mr park
i have no choice please sir
i should go beg myself
mr kim please call me
please calm down let go !
we ' ll take care of it now
let go !
sorry the company is calling me
ok let go
it ' s so late now
oh dear
what if you get in trouble ?
no i came for work
also i ' m with you
yes mr kim we ' re here
yes
hello ?
you can ' t hear me ?
when are we coming ?
i think it ' ll take a while
there ' s a problem here
the president will visit us and explain himself
clever moves are …
he said so himself
… dealt with by proper moves
i ' ll report to you when we ' re done
yes
there ' s an issue with yeong seong ? yes
i got a call from mr park
and the president and employees are coming
i checked and there were delivery problems
what ' s this ?
there are so many
call the risk management inspection and business teams
i ' ll report this to the executive director
hey yes
come over here
organize these
did you call the forwarding agency ?
this is the it sales team
our guangzhou case …
please get the contract ready for us
don ' t forget the data on shipment dates and schedule
there was a problem with yeong seong
check the accurate limits now
isn ' t it a reliable company with a good history ?
can you prepare a file on what happened ?
oh my
coming …
hello geu rae
what ' s going on ?
which floor ?
hello sir
oh mr kim
i ' m so sorry
please wait in the guest room
take him there
you go with me
who are you ?
jang geu rae in sales team 3
sir
can he go with me ?
how could i …
it ' ll be a good learning experience
and he played a big part at the site
so i ' ll need him
baek ki
yeong seong or whatever is here now
our risk management and legal teams are all there
i ' m surprised
he didn ' t seem that brave
it ' s a big issue
geu rae went into that big meeting
what ?
young yi
gosh
there was a big issue today
geu rae is going into one international ' s big meeting
how could a newbie go in there ?
he might get promoted before us all
what is it ?
ged legend
i don’t know how he ' s going to be any help
they must ' ve taken him in since he ' s some help
baek ki is being patient too
experiences of such meetings are very helpful for newbies like us
baek ki …
… why ' d you come back ?
i didn ' t think i should be there
honestly …
… he ' s not like you right ?
right you know …
yeah he is indecisive
he ' s not strong-willed
clients don ' t prioritize him either
geu rae stayed there until the end
maybe it ' s being nosy
anyway yeong seong is in big trouble
it ' s over for them
well …
… it depends on mr park ' s testimony
i think they ' ll probably just let it go
people like him just avoid problems
he doesn’t have
what it takes to solve them
were there similar cases ?
yes there was
they weren ' t situations to secure products from other locations
there no were penalties so the loss wasn ' t huge
the items didn ' t require prompt treatment so the risks weren ' t big either
regardless of compensation contract review is inevitable
it ' s been seven times
it ' s not worth a case
why did this happen ?
mr park will explain since he ' s in charge
i ' ll …
… explain
mr park was overwhelmed by the gravity of the case
he ' s concerned about the other company ' s crisis
that ' s foolish
mr park
for your reference
thanks
i ' ll tell you what hap …
the secret is to …
… scrap unnecessary things when in a crisis
become irresponsible !
scrap it
you can ' t take care of everyone
you need to survive here
i ' ll report …
… what happened
i ' m sorry sir
we were wrong
no it ' s my fault
there were seven freight delays
i found out the cause today
yeong seong was focusing on other transactions
while increasing clients
our shipments were delayed in the process
i found out about it today
and asked about the responsibility
you found out because you went to the site
yes you should always check with them
but …
… there are some problems regarding this
while those issues occurred
i didn ' t do anything about it as the one in charge
the fact is we didn ' t realize how serious this was in the beginning
also i wasn ' t
confident about my work
i ' m the one to blame here
i ' m the one
that made them think it was ok
i didn ' t take responsibility
i ' m the one …
… who ' s responsible
when the industry increased shipment costs with oil cost increases …
… our company decreased them
i couldn ' t pursuade them as a company representative
that ' s why they looked for other profits
i just thought about leaving
with frustration about work
i think i ' m at fault for this
i ' ll take responsibility
save …
… them
keep the contract
don ' t …
… penalize them
when did you start working here ?
huh ?
he ' s been here for four years
you ' re a romantic guy
would we abandon a 10-year partner because of this ?
who are you ?
why should you take responsibility ?
how will you ?
you should think about now though
it ' ll be bad for you your family and the company later
it ' s a good thing so keep thinking
wrap it up well
it was more miserable than any go game
everyone has their own game
how could i …
… dare to …
… teach him anything ?
baek ki
yes
it worked out
what ?
it sales mr park
yeong seong was saved and he didn ' t get in trouble either
the meeting went really smoothly
i heard mr park was great
oh …
… why are you telling me ?
you ' re curious no ?
i thought you were super curious
suk yool yes sir
that ?
i have to go
suk …
why are you so down when mr park ' s case went well ?
i heard you went in too
something wrong ?
i couldn ' t be of any help
what ' s with you ?
now you realize that ?
we can ' t do anything yet
geu rae
thanks geu rae
you helped remove my unnecessary traits
i ' m sorry
thank you
thank you yeong seong will
sign a new contract that works to one international ' s benefit
mr park will find the issue and
write a report on how to prevent it
i thought mr park would get in trouble
that ' s how it ' s like here
we can ' t help from having various risks
no matter how you prepare accidents happen
you can ' t ask employees to take responsibility each time
so the company focuses on
finding solutions for these issues
when you were punished last time …
that ' s why it ' s nonsense
even if the firm protects you you suffer
if you don ' t write a thorough report …
… they could ask you to take responsibility if something similar happens
mr oh shall i write the wilmart process report ?
it ' s ok i ' ll do it
ok
i sent you an email so read it
geez
thank you
next
what ' s a tradingman ?
tradingman is the ultrabest hero
in the world
he buys products for
everyone on earth
they make poor countries rich
while supplying water to those without
he beats
spiderman batman and ironman
don ' t lie !
i ' m not !
liar !
i ' ll tell my dad and scold you !
hey
stop it !
he ' s a tough one
have him work as one too yeah
do it !
now ! you !
totally like you !
yeah this is why i work here
totally like you ! right
everyone has their own game of go
hey are you crazy ?
what ' s with you today ?
i said let ' s revive a project which was on hold
not evaluate my report
that ' s not what happened i analyzed as you ?
right you  " analyzed "  it found it didn ' t suit the market trends
and the research is off !
that opinion just came out during the review
revisions are necessary since the report was made long ago
and more data is needed ?
you ' re basically saying
the report is good for nothing !
-that ' s not what i ' m saying ? -shut up !
mr kang
mr jung is looking for you
this is no dumpster
one guy throws them away another picks them up
i picked them up first
they ' re mine
a meeting to decide on sales team 3 ' s new business item
the finance team is for china
i can see that
clearly
the best plan a as well as
plans b and c are reviewed
i wonder if crude oil import won ' t work
it keeps lingering in my head
mr oh
i think you should go with something reliable this time
it ' d be preferable if we went with plan a
but it seemed mr oh preferred an item on plan b
things aren ' t looking good in iran
the us enforced an embargo on iran ' s crude oil
and the reason isn ' t clear either
nor do we know when the embargo will be lifted
i know
it ' s tough
but i still want to go with it
i have a good feeling about it
go stones hidden in the palms on one ' s hand
you get a feeling after a while
just like hood winkers hide a single card in their hand
some go players hide their opponent ' s stones in theirs
then let ' s report it to the risk management team
they can do the final check
ok
get the materials ready
i ' ll pursuade the dept manager
sure
mr oh won ' t be trying to deceive the company
but he ' s trying to be cunning with all number of cases
under consideration
the reason a newbie like myself can see that
is because that prudent man wasn ' t able to read
mr kim ' s unsatisfied face from ignoring the data
isn ' t the china case safer ?
yes but the iran case ' s profits are higher
you know crude oil can help chemicals too
can you get the approval of finances or risk management ?
it ' s too risky in this day and age
too risky
i ' ll do whatever it takes to get approval
mr oh shouldn ? t be doing that
aside from iran ' s state of affairs
the dept manager suggested the china rare earth resources proposal
he goes against it
is mr oh aware of that ?
of course
then why ?
he thinks easy ones can be done by anyone else
so he keeps obsessing over hard risky items
it boils his blood i guess
he ' s very competitive huh ?
though he can relax a bit now
honestly everyone ' s climbing up the social ladder
he doesn ' t care about his performance ratings at all
what we really need to see the results at this point
i mean mr oh needs to be promoted
what can we do ?
-let ' s do it well -huh ?
he wants to do it what can we say ?
if he can ' t he ' ll get drunk and wreak havoc with us
it ' s on hold
on hold ?
our team passed it but finance rejected it
rejected
rejected
also rejected
go get their approval
huh ?
who knows ?
it could get into the next quarter ' s sales proposal
she ' ll be wasting her time
finance will never approve
we kept submitting revised versions every quarter and nothing happened
how can she pursuade them now ?
if she pulls it off whose business will it be ?
hey
if that happens we have to go jump off a bridge
why didn ' t you give her the opinion from finance ?
come on she should find out for herself
if she can ' t figure it out she ' ll run over to mr oh again
you frozen or something ?
mr oh ?
don ' t think of reporting anything
you need to be competent for that
an incompetent guy trying to help is the worst
submit the steel data soon
yes
mr oh
so business proposals can ' t go through unless finance approves ?
no
they ' re not easy to pass
even if the other team members approve
half of them are rejected by the manager
she ' s extremely meticulous
even if your daily performance is good she won ' t go easy on you
unless you ' re 100% prepared you ' ll be in trouble
excuse me
but i think her way of working
is extremely sexy
who are you ?
never mind
there was an old smiling mask
i was shocked the moment she turned around
it felt like lightning cracked my head open
you saw the manager of finance
manager of finance ?
-yeah you said smiling mask -yes
she ' s not bad she ' s quite practical
she listens to the newbies '  opinions
in a nutshell she ' s open-minded
open-minded ? just like ?
? you
oh it ' s falling
take care of that
ok
did you check the data thoroughly ?
yes i did
where ' s the b/l draft ?
hello sir
yes negotiations are under way but revisions are being made to the documents
yes sir
bye
mr kang
the documents you requested
thanks
also mr kim wanted to ask if negotiations have started
that ' ll be ready tomorrow
when the invoice packing is ready ask mr kim to call me
or you call me
yes sir
sir is our team not going to prepare a sales proposal ?
it ' s under way
don ' t you worry about it
why shouldn ' t i worry when i ' m in the steel team too ?
why ?
why are you doing this to me ?
you like to make things bigger than it has to be ?
or get attention ?
-sir ? -what ' s with me ?
i hope this answers you
i don ' t think you ' re fully trained yet
huh ?
since you still want to do it ?
? do this
i just gave you work
make an excel chart
what ' s with your face ?
have you seen this when you were working in resources ?
it ' s about carbon emission rights
this was on hold
yes i was told to work on it for the next sales proposal
i don ' t know why it ' s on hold
so ?
you said you ' d do it ? that you ' d get approval ?
i don ' t think that ' s what resources wanted to hear from you
just let them win
just say  " sorry i can ' t do it i need help "
as far as i know the business team approved it
but the manager of finance didn ' t
manager of finance ?
the fastest way to get a reply is to go to her
but it won ' t be easy to meet with her
just lose for them
it looks like it ' s going to rain
yeah
i think it ' ll be a quick shower
you want to have a drink later ?
huh ?
boss badmouthing time
dong sik did you look into the iran item ?
they said they ' d review the documents i sent
sales team 3 is this the risk team ?
did you check the documents ?
yes the iran case ?
give me the documents geu rae
yes there won ' t be any problems later as long as we have cooperation
meeting at 3pm ?
please hurry and check your email
thanks
-dong sik ! -yes
one international jang geu rae speaking
the documents are ready
i ' ll have them approved after mr oh reviews them
bye
-one international jang geu rae ? -it ' s raining
shall about a drink after work ?
i ' m busy
hello sir
victory !
the email we requested ?
you should drink and release stress from bosses on days like this
look at our circumstances
what do you think ?
please leave
mr oh
true tradingmen would go for drinks ?
-dong sik the iran data -yes
don ' t you agree ?
-please leave -what is it you want to say ?
geu rae wrap up and go drink with him he ' s right
no sir
baek ki let ' s have a drink together
all the newbies
thank you mr oh
thank you mr kim
hello
come on
the two alcohol lovers won ' t come i guess they ' re fine
let ' s get out
why ?
this place is for having dates it ' s not a man ' s place
suk yool
what ?
what ?
you said you didn ' t want to drink
you should ' ve consulted me with your concerns young yi
baek ki has his own worries
how can he be counselling you ?
look at his face
he looks so perplexed
he couldn ' t refuse
yet has nothing to say to you
you shouldn ' t give people trouble like that
here nice
if i were you ?
? i ' d go see the finance manager
that ' s not easy
there are procedures to follow
she ' s a difficult person to deal with
her face is different from what you ' d imagine from back
the question and answer is totally different
it was just so shocking
i ' m told she ' s a great person though
she ' s practical and open-minded
she listens to the newbies too
mr oh also said she ' s quite flexible
don ? t be so careless about others '  business
i understand
it could be something that can ' t be shared with you geu rae
procedures could be much more important than you think
since they ' re a type of promise
most people trust in prepare for plan and execute that promise
i hope people who rely on those promises aren ' t fooled
let ' s do it
young yi
i ' ll just do it
they might like the newbie ' s vigor
ok
i agree with that
here
get out
huh ?
can ' t you see i ' m working ?
i ' m sorry
you ' re newbie ahn young yi in resources dev team 1 ?
yes
i don ' t know what you want to ask me directly
skipping your direct bosses but that ' s not right
your bosses will get in trouble right ?
i ' m sorry
get out
i told you not to go
who do you think you are ?
you went there looking all proud
you ' re not crying are you ?
hey
what ' s she doing ?
if you ' re late you ' re late
why the excuses ?
just forget it
come to my office
don ' t say sorry just don ' t make mistakes
i ' m going see the finance manager
what ?
come in
thanks for the apology email that was wonderful
i like people who acknowledge their mistakes
i ' m sorry
you ' re working on the carbon emission item ?
-yes -why ?
you know finance has put it on hold for 15 years right ?
yes i do
did your team ask the newbie to revive it ?
why ?
this is our review data regarding the item
submit a report on why you think
we turned it down by tomorrow
why ?
i think it ' s a fair offer for a newbie who ignored procedures
yes ma ' am
make sure i can see it first thing tomorrow morning
yes
from our point of view
i ' ll submit a report from finance ' s viewpoint
as well as another report on the issue
dang finance manager ?
she must ' ve heard of young yi ' s rumors
you know what she ' s like
i ' m sure she ' s delighted looking back on her newbie days
i ' ll see you tomorrow
bye
i ' ll take the year ' s difference into consideration
i ' ll review edit and resubmit it
yes i ' ve rechecked it it ' ll be fine
you ' re working late and drinking coffee ?
you should have dinner
you ' re leaving for the day ?
yes though it ' s embarrassing
it can ' t be as bad as what happened to me and the finance manager
wow so you ' re doing it
we don ? t know yet
i can revise it only when i know why it was rejected
i still don ' t know yet
i bought this when i was buying hangover tonic
since a scar won ' t matter much
you ' ll just scratch the scab off
thanks
hang in there
you want to take a break ?
sorry for egging you on
i think baek ki is right
i think it worked out for the best
you need to kick the ball to make a goal
that ' s true
we ' re both suffering because of items on hold
actually mr kim dissuaded mr oh
since it was decided on by upper management already
i wonder how mr oh is planning on pulling it off
he wants to visit all the executives and pursuade them
rethink it from the other ' s point of view and make it happen
i think that ' s his unique strategy
what ?
your team ?
? seems tight
rethink it from the other ' s point of view and make it happen ?
make it happen ?
i was imprudent
it ' s not going well ?
i have no clue
i could ' ve written something fancy but i didn ' t want to be deceptive
i ' m sorry
i apologize again
i ' m disappointed
i thought since you spent that much time you ' d come to a fruitful conclusion
regardless of not being able to write it i thought about something
yeah ?
i think from each dept ' s point of view
the interpretation of the proposal could be different
when sales says there ' s potential
finance could interpret it as needing further review
similarly  " positive response "
could be interpreted as  " nothing has been decided yet "
and ?
learning about finance ' s mechanism regarding business budget administration
was the biggest benefit for me
the abstract estimated profits in my head
are reevaluated with solid grounds by finance
there are businesses you can still pursue and others you can ' t
also the fact that the judgment is classified
if my proposals go on hold or get rejected
i won ' t think about what went wrong
but what i didn ' t satisfy
that ' s better than the report
you can return
i ' ll think about the penalty
yes
what was your major ?
political science ma ' am
it suits you
-did you study accounting on your own ? -i ' m studying now
ok hurry up and learn it
accounting is a language of management
thank you
i ' m impressed
baek ki is the excel file ready ?
here you go
come here
is there a problem ?
i did it as you told me with the data ?
what ' s with this new format ?
haven ' t you been trained about our format ?
if you can check the data i ' ll revise it later ?
you know i ' m really busy
who told you to do as you please ?
baek ki
don ' t you know the order ?
confirming data ?
that ' s basic and you want me to waste my time here ?
you input data and then revise the format
what company uses that process ?
you can leave now if you want to work for another company
a client meeting regarding the iran item
it started late because of their team ' s morning meeting
and there are differences in opinions
let ' s try to make things work out
i have to make a report to mr oh by noon
and mr kim has to meet a buyer at noon
so we ' re in a hurry
we just scanned through the points to check and left the client ' s office
iran ' s situation is challenging but i hope they improve
we need to review the documents if circumstances change right ?
why you think they will ?
i don ' t know
it is a dilemma
we ' re not sure if it ' s a positive or negative situation
but mr oh thinks it ' s positive
i hope he has a solution
i ' ll get going
bye
i don ' t have time to check this again
i ' m sure it ' s fine since conditions haven ' t changed much
you should recheck it if you feel uneasy
you felt uneasy during the meeting ?
i think you should check if you feel uneasy
just like you had a good feeling
you should check if you don ' t
sorry sir
there ' s something further to check so i ' ll make a report later
yes sorry
nothing ' s changed right ?
yes it ' s identical
necessary changes have been made
i ' m sorry
i just wasted your time
it ' s ok
you know what ' s risky when doing business ?
letting it become a race
you just keep looking forward
then you ' ll crash into something
glad you mentioned that
-you ' re still here -hi mr kim
great timing
let ' s go when things are looking good
sir
we ' ll go make the report
bye
one international ?
huh ?
yes sir
it ' s the iran employee
the eu placed an embargo
mr oh
you did think the embargo could be placed right ?
-yes -what about the long-term duration ?
yes
then end of discussion forget it
we can do it
how ?
the risks due to the long-term embargo are so obvious
you know there will be bigger risks and you can do it ?
mr oh
it ' s not that simple here
there ' s no way to bring the oil in
we can get it in through turkey
where ?
it ' s bordering iran they ' re on good terms with iran and not an eu nation
iran is importing a considerable amount of energy
so it won ' t be easy to go with the embargo
we can buy it through a turkish company
there is a company we ' ve worked with for a long time
they ' re in the country
there are different businesses with iran too
there are circumstances but we can make a request to iran
turkey ?
what do you think risk team ?
i like it
i agree sir
we have a solid infra with turkey
cheers !
we just need the executive director ' s approval
-ok -just the procedures are left
good job guys
what ' s wrong ?
i ?  what ?
oh you don ' t look too happy
no i am
what is it ? tell me
will the manager be ok ?
he focused on the china item
we didn ' t order that
i ordered it
the results will soon show
if it ' s good data
or not
hello ?
go with the china item
keep this
they ' re our team ' s assets
yes
let ' s go
where are you going ?
let ' s eat meat
we ' ll have a burner please
this is the norm so it ' s just the beginning
up until now it was a warm up
will you leave the theater
only after the trailer ?
mr oh
the burner is hot now
we should put meat on it
just the part of the meat has changed
sir forget about head meat
please give us premium beef here !
don ' t drink it from the bottle
what was your excuse for drinking today ?
nice !
you ' re always happy alone !
geez
yeah
i was so happy i drank
can ' t i drink ?
i ' m going to roast grade a premium beef from now on
drink up
with this ?
geez you must be crazy
oh my !
hey ! come here !
what ' s with you ?
i wonder how mr oh felt
the news articles he had collected himself
numerous memos
cutting out the changing news of the times ?
? did he think the same thing as me ?
i told them to do it last july
mr oh started on a new item the very next day as if nothing ever happened
did you check the circumstances with china ?
yes
i ' ll check and let you know
yes
i think around august
i have a small box now
geu rae
did you collect the reports from the economics research center too ?
yes
the more my box fills up the more i will have learned
ok let ' s gather up
this spells trouble
china ' s situation is so different from when we started
china increased their importing product line
they ' re in charge of 90% of the world ' s market with rare earth resources
so this will make importing hard
how come other countries don ' t go into development ?
it can really ruin the environment
that ' s why china has a quota system
if you look at today ' s research center report
it means we should stay low for now
i think that would be smart
mr oh
do whatever it takes
i ' ll back you up
the situation doesn ' t look like that will cover it
business isn ' t easy
everything has variables
with the iran item you ignored the international circumstances
why are you hesitating now ?
you know it was reported in my name
don ' t whine ok ?
don ' t pull pranks because yours was rejected !
going forward
not yet ?
let ' s go forward
mr kim the report ?
look at this
they ' re all saying it ' s a super-cycle trend
things aren ' t looking good
we ' ll have to see
set a meeting with china tomorrow
they can come or we go
we should recheck it
reports keep coming in
the dept manager used to work on this item
we need to do it and he wants it
i know but the circumstances have changed
yes
a long time has passed
since i brought up the item on hold again
whether if it ' s the dept manager ' s performance results or not
i ' m the one responsible for delaying the stable item
also worsened situations due to an aggravated environment
it ' s our team ' s responsibility
if you can ' t resolve this he ' ll have a hard time
we have to do it
honestly everyone ' s climbing up the social ladder
he doesn ' t care about his performance ratings at all
what we really need to see the results at this point
i mean mr oh needs to be promoted
let ' s do it well
of course
now i should be able to fulfill one man ' s workload
you ' re alone ?
sir
they ' re all out ?
yes they all just left
tell mr oh i want to see him
sure
hey
it ' s much riskier than you said
don ? t you know china has increased their business and shifts are being made ?
yes we ' re going to supplement that
i ' m sure i told you the warnings when the first proposal was made
among the three items the one you ?
that ' s not it
among the items you brought i said
" let ' s try that "  about the safest choice
oh but the china item now was your idea ?
it was just an idea
an idea isn ' t a proposal
is it ?
i ' ll do well so it doesn ' t have a negative effect on you
hey
who do you think you are ?
i ' m sorry
anyway go ahead with your item mr oh
make reports right away
delete the part where it says it ' s my idea
that ' s such a minor detail
then what about backup for the china item ?
don ' t you have hands to work with ?
what backup ?
the company is backing you up !
yes sir
come see me
where are you going ?
the dept manager wants to see me
he wants to see the business data out of the blue
-why ? -it ' s obvious
he wants to take credit
you know with our business from the briefing last time
he was blatantly claiming your proposal was bad
do a better job
what ?
he said you go a different direction from what he wants
do a better job for him
you should change things for improvement
kiss up to the bosses too
i ' m too sorry to get promoted
yes !
mr oh i heard ?
get out
it better work
don ? t think of the price and look
into all the companies with quota systems
yes sir
geu rae
go with him
yes sir
we could force it
but all the companies with quota systems have different prices
you could get blamed for everything
we ' re going to change our item too
non-quota ?
no way it ' s smuggling
people with those baits wouldn ' t be at big companies
i ' m surprised there ' s 60% more smuggling
it ' s hard to get a big quantity without smuggling
patience is a virtue but our team can ' t afford that
-what ' s mr kim like ? -who ?
the dept manager
a typical man earning a salary
that ' s what i ' d call him
he ' s perfect for the times
he ' s quick and eloquent
very sharp
what can a company employee look forward to besides promotions ?
do you think that ' s all there is to it too ?
so far ?
since i haven ' t found anything else
let ' s save mr oh ? i mean our team first
so obnoxious
hello
you should watch where you ' re going
your lower body is weak huh ?
a man ' s lower body is key huh ?
use the stairs from now on not this
aren ' t you going ?
huh ?
thanks
is your foot ok ?
what about my foot ?
i told you to come to my team
you ' re suffering because you didn ' t
the carbon emission item ?
i like it
you can ' t make it a national business right ?
right
i can ' t make a profit structure that finance will pass
when did you learn russian ?
you seemed good
in college
i was an exchange student for an year
what about you ?
i lived there for 2 years for work
i learned a lot then because i always loved russian
there ' s a word for  " white night "  in russian you know ?
you know the ballet dancer mikhail baryshnikov ?
i was moved by that movie as a kid and vowed to go to russia someday
you know their famous theater ?
mikhail baryshnikov is dancing there
vladimir vysotsky sings
you don ' t know right ?
he ' s a famous revolutionary singer
like a wild horse
the russian culture has tragic beauty
it ' s a us film
-the us ? -yes
not russian ?
i got carried away
i heard you left the rare earth resource case with the quota system
mm-hmm
dang
i didn ' t know china would be so fickle
i go there like i drink water
i never had a hunch
we overlook what we think is obvious
tell me about it
we overlook what we think is obvious ?
i better go
thanks
use that item ?
thanks mr oh
we overlook what we think is obvious ?
yes sir
something new ?
yes there ' s news
what is it ?
i found a solution for the rare earth resources
what ?
the korean resource corporation is developing them with north korea
huh ?
estimated at 20000000 tons
it will become twentyfold once it ' s official
set a meeting with the planning dept your employees should come
it ' ll be in an hour
yes
sir this ?
work on it and i ' ll see to it after i ' m done with sales team 3
weren ' t you going to report with our item ?
when did i say i ' d do that ?
it started out with my item from sales team 3 !
but ?
sir our manager changed his mind
what ' s wrong with him ?
i ' m going crazy
it ' s just procedures
sales team 2 ' s item will be reported too
that ' s not the issue
it has to be an item backed by him
please pursuade him
i ' ve never had such a big meeting before
they ' re just saying it was for a meeting
but not acknowledging it officially
connect hotlines to the research centers government depts
and the public corporation
check and review the content
the planning team uses connections to secure the latest info
yes
this isn ' t the time for management
yes we ' re looking for the right timing politically
the collected info is made
orderly by mr oh and mr kim
rare earth resource stocks are shaky
of course all the meeting content is recorded
that ' s my job
your team should submit a progress report twice a day
-yes -that ' s all for today
thank you
thanks
sir
hello
hello
hello
what is it ?
do you have time this evening ?
you have something to say ?
let ' s eat together

mr kim was set on our item
he wants to change his mind
i mean regarding promotion and all it ' s totally your timing
this is too much
-mr lee -organize this
don ' t worry about that
geu rae get the minutes ready and send it
yes
how long does it take ?
i said use simple keywords !
sales team 2 ' s screams were desperate
what can a company employee look forward to besides promotions ?
delete this make it work !
you think this will ?
nothing is simple
will you think ?
mr kang is good
the finance team can ' t complain
he ' s perfect
of course he ' s great in other aspects
what ?
you want to have a drink ?
aren ' t you going to leave ?
wrap up now
yes
check if it ' s accurate
yes sir
i can ' t believe this
what ' s with your expression ?
another mistake ?
we ' ll have to add to the next sales proposal
so annoying
what is it ?
what is this ?
the korean carbon emission item with the russian forest ?
is this possible ?
it seems so
this ?  sounds ok
finance will pass it
i know
now i get it
you said mr cho in fabric is the scariest
i ' m scared too
i hate it !
right ?
i don ' t care !
let ' s go before we ' re late
yes
you know where to come to eat right ?
did it go well ?
i think it went well

mr oh is creating a business
let ' s cheer him on
sir

resource businesses should be huge
yes sir

yes
yes !
ok let ' s drink
cheers
cheers !
hurray mr kim !
great choice
sir !

our resource development team is here
yes
i heard a familiar voice
so i peeked in
we were having dinner too
what a loud dinner
looking good
yes
wait
can i see that ?
yes
rare earth resource ?
yes
why is sales team 3 dealing with the resource team ' s item ?
it ' s the resource team ' s item
-look -yes
you mentioned rare earth resources last time
oh yes
i was going to submit a proper report
the resource team should do it
mr kim
it overlaps so why not combine them ?
yes
why suffer when there are pros ?

it ' s on me so enjoy your time
find something that suits you
let ' s go
mr kim
sit over here
take your time
let ' s go mr ko
yes
yes
sir
sir
let ' s eat
i ' m hungry
we started eating without a word
we were suddenly starving
we had to eat something
i learned why we had to get drunk
and ?
? i can ' t comfort anyone as a newbie ?
? i ' m sorry
she ' ll kill me
she must ' ve changed the number
what time is it now ?
geez
gosh
honey lights light !
it ' s on
is it bright now ?
why do you drink every day ?
every single day !
can ' t you stop drinking ?
no
why not ?
because it ' s tasty
what ?
do you know that taste ?
dang
do you guys know that taste ?
do you ?
if you want to accomplish something health should be your priority
the reason you lag towards the end
the reason you recover slowly from damage
and the reason a mistake affects you for so long
are all because you ' re health is not at the best
when you ' re unfit you want to be comfortable and you lose patience
then you become so tired
you don ' t care about victories
if you want to win your body
should be able to withstand your challenges
will power is nothing without your body health
what do you do on the weekends ?
i watch movies
read books
and sometimes exercise
i like exercising too i do yoga
i heard you moved out of home
yes
i agree parents have done their deed by raising their kids up to age 20
right
we can ' t rely on our dads anymore
we need an oppa by that age
how ' s working for a big company ?
you must have enough money for a house
even large ones
an na wants to get married soon
an na hates working
it cramps your style and makes you look poor
healing
healing is necessary
welcome
i ' ll have the earliest show of my way
what brings you here ?
i live nearby
you too ?
no
i was in the area
that ' s a blind date outfit right there
huh ? no
friend ' s wedding
you must not have enjoyed it
right
the bride wasn ' t nice
she was interested in the groom ' s company ' s loan system
-the wedding was a horror movie -horror ?
are you here alone ?
yes
thank you
one two
give it to me
why didn ' t you tell me you didn ' t like horror ?
you saw two in a row today
there ' s a nice blood stew place nearby shall we go ?
see you tomorrow
baek ki
shall i tell you another scary story ?
huh ?
tomorrow ' s monday
look i made dad ' s company
hey dad !
get up !
get up !
stop !
get up !
you should play with them on sundays !
let me get some rest on sundays
i want to rest too !
honey
i feel so weird today
under the weather
you ' re still drunk !

i don ' t need that
hello
hi -da in
you look tired
-you too -no way
-i ' m just busy -ask for more people
-don ' t say that if you won ' t come -invite me
congratulations
hello
i ' m sorry about the rare earth resource item
there ' s nothing for you to be sorry about
mr oh is disappointed isn ' t he ?
yes
mr kim is going to support him this time
he ' ll give him a big one
the arab mecca phone item ?
it ' s worth $3 mil
the it sales team was on it so it ' s nearly prepared
will mr mun be on it again ?
then who else ?
i can ' t do it
what ?
you know what he ' s like
give me a job i can do
hey you earn a salary so how can you say that ?
you should be able to do anything you ' re told to do !
anyway i don ? t want to be embarrassed in front of my kids
you ' re ridiculous
you want to idle around at home ?
yes i ' ll do that
i ' ll submit my resignation
resignation ?
dong sik ' s issue affected our dept ' s performance
ok if you sign the deal i ' ll get you more people
really ?
so did you say you ' d do it ?
did you say you wouldn ' t do it ?
anyway he said we ' d get more people
can ' t you just do it ?
he has to do it
what is he worried about then ?
i can ' t commit a crime as a dad
this is just like embezzlement
i think it ' s different
it ' s worse man !
ok if you say so but my question is
did you say you ' d do it or not ?
you want to be stubborn with that absurd reason ?
alright
from now on i ' ll give your team all the sales headquarters '  work
-repair those damages from now on ! -huh ?
that ' s just absurd !
it ' s the mecca phone data from it sales
but ?
the agency list is here too
so we have to do it
call them to check the progress
-models and make applications -yes
we could be doomed
huh ?
what will you do ?
we have to do it
we need to find a solution
a way to make him give up
dong sik
project budget
we don ' t have much left do we ?
what ?
you ' re short on the project budget ?
yes
i really want to do it but i can ' t
yeah ?
use mine
if that ' s not enough get a receipt
i ' ll take care of it all here
it was weird
mr oh took on any job
i wonder why not this one
he has a unique character
character
huh ?
mr mun ?
he has a big distribution company in the middle east
it ' s a big client
they ' re a key partner
then why is mr oh ?
mr mun is quirky
so everyone avoids him
so it ' s of little interest from our point of view
look
why do you think it sales told us to
have it forsaking their performance ?
is he fussy ?
you just ?  have to
make things happen you know
mr oh ' s character ?
this goes against his principles
principles ? what principles ?
oh !
ok
let ' s get sick
i bought expired milk as you asked me to
good
i also put it under the sun for
three hours as you asked me to
good
what will you do with this ?
drink it
huh ?
if we get food poisoning he can ' t make us do it
mr oh !
drink it
how can we drink this ?
drink it
you have to
ok
you still have some
man
is it coming out ?
no it was dirty
i ' m not getting any signals
me neither
are you sure it was expired ?
yes i ' m sure sir
is your stomach fine too mr oh ?
dang lactic acid bacteria !
he said  " principle "
principle
work is everything for us
so i wonder what principle could possibly go against it
is there such a thing ?
yes sales team 3 oh sang sik
hello
this is madam cha at jangwon
we had our grand opening in shinsa-dong
i called to say hi
why are you calling this office ?
jangwon ?
oh sang sik speaking
hello mr oh sang sik kim dong sik speaking
we ' ve renovated our place in bangbae-dong
not interested
i ' ll tell him
-geez -i ' ll call you back
yes sir
it ' s mr lee from a luxury lounge in seocho-dong
-he said he ' d give you a 20% discount -hey !
rumors must ' ve spread last time with the it sales team
excuse me
are you mr oh sang sik ?
yes i am
i ' m michelle jang of partners cooperation
i want to be your business partner
but what is ?
ms bae
you ' ll be doing business with ceo
mr mun in the arab correct ?
we sealed the contract last year
entertaining him with sales team 1
you can ignore all the calls you ' ve received
partners cooperation will be your best partner
from limousine pickup service
to any service the vip wants
we ' ll satisfy all your needs
of course
round 2 also satisfaction guaranteed
just overlook it this time buddy ok ?
don ' t you feel sorry for dong sik ?
his face looks like a sick chicken now
what ?
mr kim promised to get you more people right ?
geez
mun chung gi making a dirty mess at the bar is one thing
there ' s a reason mr oh hates entertaining him
he ' s always wants round 2
round 2 ?
it ' s illegal of course
some buyers want that even these days
mr oh won ' t do it because of his principles not just the laws
principles
so what do you mean ?
well he told me a few times
so it has to do with human rights
human dignity something ?
so i can ' t explain it
mr oh ' s principle is he won ' t
ever entertain them with round 2
so he puts people above work ?
right
it ' s so frustrating
honestly this is a team effort and there ' s no such thing as principles
you do what you have to
if we just pull this off
this quarter ' s performance will be good
eat it
i ' m good
hello mr oh
hey
what are you worried about ?
-just finish with round 1 -what ?
get him drunk and sign the deal it ' s simple
he ' ll be down with round 1
the mecca phone item is a headache right ?
i know everything
i want to help you since i ' m smart regarding that area
unfortunately i ' m so busy myself
baek ki !
hey !
i want to help him too
there ' s no solution
i hope he doesn ' t get different ideas
you can leave now if you want
to work at a different company
i ' m lee ji hyun at headhunting firm search & brains
i ' d like to recommend good companies
if you ' re thinking of changing jobs
great timing
hey about the carbon emission item
finance gave approval
the day has finally come
whose business shall we make it ?
let ' s make it yours
it was originally your plan
young yi just added russian photos
she made the crucial hit
so do it together
huh ?
-no she can do it herself -why you !
that ' s absurd
she ' s smart but still a newbie
she can ' t do it alone
i can ' t work with her !
hey !
you think i want to give her work ?
this could be a big success
think of the team !
finance gave approval ?
yeah
good job
thanks
mr ha ' s in charge so support him well
ok i ' ll do my best
-sir -let ' s talk
tell him you can ' t do it
huh ?
don ' t feign ignorance
you thought i ' d want to work with you ?
i ' ll support you well
hey don ' t you get it ?
" i ' ll support you well "  ?
you want to act cool to the end ?
-sir ? -tell him you can ' t do it
if you ' re a part of our team
don ' t cause any more trouble !
don ' t you feel sorry for dong sik ?
his face looks like a sick chicken now
one international kim dong sik speaking
yes hello
yes
i ' m not sure about that matter
i ' ll check and call you back
yes bye
mr kim
yes
mr kim promised to get you more people right ?
dong sik !
yes ?
let ' s do it !
yes
huh ?
let ' s do it
do it !
let ' s do it !
i ' ll seal the deal by round 1
geu rae
tell suk yool to come
i ' ll start now
this is the entertainment strategy for mecca phone ceo mun chung gi
his trade insurance corporation grade is a
-his occupation ? -i know
that ' s not important
this is the list of people who failed to sign the contract with him
they have one thing in common
they all couldn ' t or wouldn ' t entertain him with round 2
when they did have round 2
they all signed the deal
or had a positive response
-none of them signed after round 1 ? -no
ok what ' s the possibility he ' ll
sign it when he ' s drunk after round 1 ?
the answer is we don ' t know
he ' s never been dead drunk
let ' s say he happened to get hammered
he ' s laid-back
liberal and a big bluff
he might feel good
so it could be possible
-that ' s the alternative we have for now -ok
like i said before the problem is
he ' s never been hammered
how ' s his tolerance ?
for a 40% degrees whiskey ?
he has to have three bottles of 40% degrees
whiskeys within 15 hours to get drunk
so it ' s a bottle per hour just make it simple
i ' m sorry
we must get him to sign by round 1
we can ' t get drunk first
sorry i ' m late
things ran late
the seating is key
mr oh will sit here and mr kim on the opposite side
geu rae will sit next to mr kim
mr mun will sit in the seat of honor ?
young yi
sorry
glad you ' re here young yi
later mr oh
mr oh
sit down
this is mr mun
she can ' t be him
aren ' t you busy ?
i am excuse me
sit down
mr oh will pour mr mun a drink
next you will mr kim
while he ' s drinking mr oh ?  excuse me
you ' ll act like you ' re taking a phone call and leave
-in this chaotic moment ?  geu rae -huh ?
then you go
so he ' s drinking three shots while we drink one ?
-yes -good idea
but
this can ' t last forever
prepare two bottles of whiskey from the get-go
one is real and one is black tea
after mr mun pours all of you a drink
geu rae pours him one
mr kim will then change it with a shot of black tea
wet towels and trashcans to throw out the alcohol are essential here
you act like you ' re drinking it then you spit it out
the wet towel can ' t absorb too much
so if you spit it out before absorption it will get messy
the key to the trick is the absorption
so keep many dry towels similar to the wet one
you need to put empty glasses in your pocket
to change them with full shots
you need to act drunk
and remember to call each other every 30 minutes to rotate seats
boilermakers are seven times as strong as normal alcohol
learn how to make them it ' ll make things exciting
see now you get it ?
why i kept saying we needed her ?
i ' ve tasted 40 types of alcohol including loyal alchohol
rainbow alcohol gold liquor and cappuccino liquor
ok geu rae
learn how to make boilermakers from him
thanks
let ' s go
learn it
who are you young yi ?
principle ?
why are you laughing ?
i feel like looking at an old
watch in an antique store
huh ?
the word  " principle "
nowadays college professors who mention
" social justice "  get the same response
mr oh still has it
or he ' s struggling to keep his soul alive
mr oh ?
you really won ' t prepare round 2 ?
-mr oh what if ? -no !
get all the info you can about mun including receipts
why you i ' ll do whatever it takes
to make you sign it by round 1
give me the revised agency list
stand there and i ' ll tell you what to fix
good job it looks fine
do this too
they ' re contract documents
check for typos any mistakes
and make sure i can mail it by noon tomorrow
you heard it
please do it by tomorrow noon
huh ?
baek ki
what are you doing ?
i came to create business
i didn ' t come here to make charts
check typos and balance accounts
i ' ve done enough of those tedious tasks as an intern
i don ' t think they ' re for me to do anymore
can ' t you see how other team newbies are working ?
their names are already on the next sales proposal even geu ?
sir
how come you don ' t like me ?
haven ' t you learned anything so far ?
all i ' ve learned is patience
i think it ' s time to apply what i ' ve learned
put that back on his desk
baek ki
don ' t need to console me
why ' s he so angry ?
mr oh
-are you off for the day ? -yes
we ' ll have grade a premium beef join us

please that ' s enough dad
sorry when did you get off ?
i didn ' t even say bye
bye see you tomorrow
their names are already on the next sales proposal even geu ?
haven ' t you learned anything so far ?
firm search & brains

we panicked even before we could load our guns
oh excuse me
hello ?
hold on hello ?
hold on ? hello ?
mr oh
the most meticulous plan in the history
of alcohol entertainment with clients
was ruined before it even started
in front of the heaviest drinker on earth
here
ok
the boilermaker recipe i learned
-at the last minute was useless -this is a water fountain
wow
round 2 !
round 2 !
we will party till the break of dawn here you go
ok
mr kim couldn ' t tell which was
whiskey and which was black tea
mr oh was still struggling to get
the contract signed by round 1
here ' s me
we realized when the clock hit 4:00 in the morning
we had totally failed
mr oh ' s heart will
cry a river of tears all night
hey

geu rae

how ?  did you ?
i sent her there
mr oh
that quenches my thirst so well
mr oh
man
you thought i ' d do whatever he wants ?
you sent his wife ?
it ' s all in the data
data research is always crucial
the key is in the data
in some of the economy news on mun chung gi
they said he ' d be arriving with his wife
i happened to see his anniversary
it happened to be the same day we were entertaining him
that made my blood boil for a minute
huh ?
he was going to screw around on his anniversary
ideas boiled in my head at the same time
regarding the round 2 readiness you mentioned
i ' m sure i said preparations not readiness
i wanted to give his poor wife
an unforgettable anniversary gift
i met her on the morning of that day
and told her about our gift for her
you mean  " your "  gift
then everything happened perfectly after that
we failed perfectly you mean
how could this happen ?
gosh !
what guy would want to be entertained by his wife ?
so you chose your principle
instead of the contract
what will you tell mr kim ?
dang you ' re crazy !
are you insane ?
sang sik you might as well jump off a bridge !
as long as i ' m in headquarters
you will never get more people !
i told you before
repair the damages made by all the sales headquarters !
all of it !
everything !
gosh
hello ?
dad !
my baby future tradingman !
dad are you coming home early tonight ?
yeah
then buy some spicy chicken on the way
just spicy chicken ?
what about fried chicken ?
then make it fried
only fried chicken ?
what about spicy ?
then buy half and half
then shall i buy two half-half chickens ?
then you can just buy one spicy and one fried
right
you ' re dumb dad !
hey don ' t call your dad dumb
i love you dad bye !
i love you
oh gosh
i feel so down
blood dang ?
dad
buy one half-half and one spicy
from your no 1 son
you were here ? you weren ' t picking up your phone
you had a nosebleed ?
yeah
are you ok ?
i dozed off for a few minutes
now i ' m bleeding
you dozed off ?
i don ? t know if i dozed off or fainted
maybe my blood pressure rose because of fatigue
i ' m ok
don ' t tell dong sik anything
i don ' t want to hear him nag
young yi
yes
why are you looking at the eu-ets data ?
what are you trying to do ?
what do you take me for ?
i told you to butt out
you ' re trying to get on my nerves ?
you ' re saying it ' s yours and you have the right ?
that ' s not it sir
if you can ' t drop it ?
fine take it
i don ' t have to do it
put your frigging name in the center and succeed !
young yi
suk yool
keep your chin up
everyone knows losers act like that
guys can be the biggest losers
more so around talented women
be strong since you ' re not at fault
when you pulled off the 2-year-old item as an intern
rumors of your legendary talent spread everywhere
go back to that young yi
keep your chin up and be proud
be strong
that ' s more like you
what ?
i ' ll do as you said
as you said i ' ll keep out of it
i ' ll run your errands
while you ' re on that item
what ?
send us your resume by midnight
baek ki
is the document i asked for ready ?
i ' ll wrap it up so you can have it by tomorrow
baek ki
i won ' t stop you if you want to quit
steel is a conservative business
a single item changes gradually adjusting to the business market
over a long term
so for our team members
rather than someone who is eloquent and focused on instant results
we need someone with basic skills
who can look far into the horizon
so
are you telling me you ' ve taught me basic skills so far ?
then i ' ve certainly been mistreated
i ' ve learned the basics in school as an intern and work training
teaching me the basics
is just an excuse
i think you just don ? t like me
see you tomorrow
i want to hear it this time
how come you don ' t like me ?
baek ki
it ' s not a matter of liking someone or not
i don ' t even know you that well
then what is it ?
don ' t you remember the first thing you did
after you were assigned to the team ?
sir
i developed a profitable idea for the steel team
are you talking about the business item report ?
i think training includes the time to check what one has learned
there ' s a big pile of files for a newbie to learn but you
gave me a business report as soon as you came
before you even read the steel item files
if you try to stand out from the crowd
you become hasty
if the basic skills are so important
why didn ' t you tell me from the start ?
i gave you many chances to see your own
mistakes i don ' t know about others
but that ' s my style
chances ?
you call making graphs and
checking typos  " chances ?  "
can ' t i learn more by working
together with the team ?
you have a long way to go
you ' re off for the day ?
yes
bye
i decided to take your advice
huh ?
i decided to give in as you said
i realized what beats a strong spear
is not a stronger spear or a shield
you found your solution
and i found mine
shouldn ' t you drink ginseng instead of onion juice ?
she ' ll buy it for me next month after kids
give it to me
why are you sweating so much ?
it ' s weird
shouldn ' t you go see a doctor ?
i ' m just hot
i ' ll get some rest
sure
this won ' t do
i ' ll go get some air dong sik
-yes -answer any calls for me
yes sir
what ' s wrong with me ?
where on earth is mr oh ?
he went out for some air because he was dizzy
he ' s not picking up his phone
dizzy ?
he must ' ve overworked himself
any other symptoms besides dizziness ?
other symptoms ?
like what ?
your forties are risky
one of my friends worked like a dog
similar to him and had a stroke
come on a stroke in your forties ?
one actually collapsed due to high blood pressure
and died
come on
he fainted yesterday he had a nosebleed too
what ?
why are you saying that now ?
he still won ' t pick up ?
no although it ' s ringing
i hope he didn ' t collapse somewhere
i ' m sorry
call him !
keep calling him !
i ' m ok hurry up !
please leave a message ?
where on earth are you mr oh ?
where is everyone ?
looking for mr oh
he went for a break and hasn ? t returned
he should ' ve told us where he went
he must be feeling under the weather and stressed out
under the weather ?
is it serious ?
i heard he fainted and had a nosebleed yesterday
i hope he didn ' t collapse somewhere
then why are you standing here ?
-get your team to look for him too ! -yes
mr hwang mr jang ?
what time is it ?
missed some calls ?
oh mr kim too
hi
mr oh !
mr kim
what ' s with you ?
why won ' t you get another health checkup ?
uh ?
you know it ' s reflected in the performance
don ' t you know i have no choice if your form isn ' t filled in ?
i ' m sorry
how old is your eldest ?
he ' s in 6th grade now
i ' ve been to your kids '  first birthdays
with work here i can ' t tell you to spend time with your family
but a dad should take care of his health !
you need to include yourself in that you know !
get another checkup and find a big middle east item next
i ' ll support you this time
thank you sir
wait
take this
i bought dried eels for buyers
take it
it ' s ok
come on
take it
take it !
it ' s heavy
thank you sir
hello
yes
huh ?
mr oh !
it ' s ok i ' m sorry
you were so dark
did mr kim give you that ?
it ' s dried eel
you want some ?
it ? s ok you have all of it
eat it for your health
don ' t let the stamina give you another kid
hey mr oh !
what on earth did you do ?
yes mr oh !
you said you didn ' t want to do it
you sold your soul didn ' t you ?
how come he wants a double contract ?
card ?
-card ? -you haven ' t returned it right ?
go treat yourselves with beef
ok ?
wow
-yes mr oh ! -what ' s going on ?
so the wife entertainment worked ?
mr mun is that romantic ?
i guess he is
let ' s call it a day
what about beef ?
no i need to eat eel
geu rae
clear the documents about mr mun on my desk
what about beef ?
no
give us the card at least !
come on
so mun ' s wife is the person
in charge of the company
so you chose your principle instead of the contract
so you actually ?
hit two birds with one stone
it ' s a liberal foreign company
there ' s not a lot of overtime work
you can control the amount of your work
they like your various experiences
so just tell them
can i choose the dept i want ?
probably
oh he ' s too hasty
when will we get more people ?
i heard mr kim would get us a pro on the middle east
he will soon
who ' s coming ?
i don ' t know
who ' s coming ?
i don ' t know
you need experience to be quick
-who do you wish would come ? -young yi
she should ' ve come to begin with
-i ' ll ? -go !
go !
mr oh
hello
we ' re on the same team
target the crises in front of you
yes !
-what ? -is the interview date set ?
he ' s the legend of the jordan export contract
shouldn ' t be so arrogant ?
he ' s a part of sales team 3 now
we didn ' t learn how to express our feelings in school
they ' re not dating are they ? what do you think ?
-i don ' t know -oh !
you ' re the pretty face of our place
what did you do to spread those dirty rumors ?
i ' m going to quit
mr oh
hello
we ' re on the same team
mr kim
you always seem like the perfect worker
i ' m jang geu rae
oh the contract worker with connections ?
i heard you only have a ged
you ' re lucky
how did he make it ?
i heard he ' s not even competent
my seat ?
where is it ?
it ' s here right ?
whose is this ?
let ' s make a good team
what are you saying ?
send another man please
if you can ' t you don ' t need to send anyone over
hey
why are you acting like a kid ?
i ' m saying i need someone to help the team
that ' s mr park
you can ' t find anyone better nowadays
even when i was with resource
he brought in all the profits
no one is a perfect fit
you need to get used to each other
work is the priority
hey
i heard you recommended mr park
yes isn ' t he talented ?
what ' s with you ?
you want me to clean up a mess ?
-mess ? -i have ears too
i hear the rumors also
do you think i don ' t know you suffered when you worked with him ?
i just thought he was good
but he didn ' t suit our team
i think he was like that due
to my lack of leadership
sounds like you would even sacrifice
yourself to send him away
ged
yes
come here
i heard you never went to college
a rags-to-riches story isn ' t it ?
interesting
how did you pull off the entrance presentation ?
mr kim did you give out
the tasks in advance ?
you won ' t know how to do anything
you ' re pretty so you can be the face of our place
looks are key to sales positions
so keep your chin up
you have a girlfriend don ' t you ? show me her picture
come on
you can get familiar later get organized first
mr oh
pay me some respect in
front of the subordinates
save me some face here
what did they call you before ?
of course ?
how did you address mr park when he was in your team ?
ok
i don ? t think i was out of line
sure sure
you didn ' t have to check that
why are you standing there ?
i ' m sorry
why were you just standing there ?
huh ?
yeah how could you possibly put up with him ?
why did they send mr park of all people ?
we ' re in big trouble
geu rae
get the meeting files ready
these are the meeting files
those are the middle east items
see if there ' s anything good
what ' s the rush ?
i ' ve only been here for three days
i haven ' t gotten myself oriented yet
when will i read all these papers ?
this will just be super tight
this one won ' t be worth the effort
ged
you did this ?
mr oh
this is no good
you need more than ambition for the middle east
then think of some plausible items
you didn ' t hear me did you ?
i haven ' t gotten myself oriented yet
even with poker when you join mid-game
you take your time for that
gosh
you ' re talented
i ' ll come tomorrow
call me if anything comes up
yes sir
hello this is jang baek ki
has the interview date been set ?
yes
it ' s a weekday
no
i can take a day off

don ' t do what i didn ' t even ask you to
dang

dang
young yi

didn ' t you allow this ?
as you said i ' ll keep out of it
i ' ll run your errands
while you ' re on that item
yeah ?
fine go ahead
empty all the trash cans
also wash the bins
what you can ' t do it ?
no i ' ll do it
wash everyone else ' s too while you ' re at it
yes sir
hey
what ' s with her ?
i gave her work since she was dying for some
what ' s with you man ?
you shouldn ' t have made her do that
i know
baek ki
is this how you can be a team member ?
why throw that out there ?
baek ki
dang
i mean ?  dang !
let ' s talk
what ' s going on ?
they ?  seem ?  weird
they ' re not dating are they ?
answer me geu rae
i don ' t know
ok
you and i don ' t deserve this treatment here
i don ' t think you need to stay
if the company doesn ' t want you
-i think you should just leave too -baek ki
don ? t ever butt in my business like this again
i didn ' t mean  " give in "  like this
letting them have their way is your solution ?
yes
i chose to do that
that ' s not right
then what can i do ?
what ?
tell me if you know
working hard doesn ' t work
and i can ' t just do nothing
what else can i do ?
we didn ' t learn in school how to approach to those
who shut you out
not in math or english class
that ' s why
that ' s why i ' m just doing what i can
i mean whatever i can
this is my solution
you said you found your solution
so let ' s just
do our own thing on our own
i ' m going to quit
oh !
suk yool !
i sent the files to tae jin

nothing
where ' s mr park ?
he ' s meeting a client
he just came to our team which client ?
he said it ' s a client from resource
call him geu rae
yes
what did they call you before ?
how did you address mr park when he was in your team ?
i don ? t think i was out of line

see if there ' s anything good
we ' re all working for a salary
why act like a hot shot ?

he went to pohang for business
yes one international steel

who is this ?
yes
yes i ' ll leave a memo
bye
give this to him
the epc tf item
mr kang ' s report has been reviewed
so steel can approve it first
it ' s urgent requiring resource and
our approval too so it ' s top priority
yes
i ' ll tell him
where ' s mr cha ?
he ' s in myanmar on business
your team needs more people too
i hope you don ' t have
your mind on other things
pardon ?
see you later
time flies by
time to take off already
where were you mr park ?
huh ?
geez ged !
you didn ? t tell him ?
i told you i ' d see a client
-i ? -you meet clients at a sauna ?
i can smell the mugwort
your sense of smell is as
keen as ever sang sik
mr park
yes
call me mr oh at work
ok
you ' ve become authoritative over time
you weren ' t like this before
don ' t go to saunas during work
you ' re neglecting your work
yes
i ' m sorry
we should work
halal ?
shall i work on this ?
as prescribed by muslim law
you think it ' s good ?
arabic term meaning " lawful or permissible " ]
well it ' s not a big item
it ' s perfect for learning about the middle east
i think it ' s ok for sales team 3 ?
ok then
i can ' t do it alone
-mr kim -yes
give me geu rae he ' ll do
he ' s still ?
no ?
why not ?
you can ' t do it ?
i don ' t need great support
i ' ll give him something that only requires a ged
you have a ged
aren ' t i right ?
mr park
mr oh
if you allow it i ' ll support mr park
geu rae
what are you saying ?
who ' s higher here mr oh or mr park ?
listen to yourself talking
dong sik
come on don ' t make this an issue dude
" dude ?  "
don ' t call me  " dude "  sir
-what ? -stop
this team is all messed up
subordinates talking back to those who are higher
wow
things are looking good
you ' re close already ?
hello mr kim
hi how do you like your team ?
i look forward to fantastic teamwork
this team is important
work hard
i did my best to send you here
yes i ' ll keep that in mind
-ok -sir
where do you go to shoot pool nowadays ?
-i sprained my wrist last time -oh
so i ' m taking a break now
are you ok ?
i ' m ok
anyway i have high hopes
see you later
see you sir
you shouldn ' t screw me over like this
he used to be a good worker
he ' ll help our team as a middle eastern expert
i know
he was the legend in the steel team
with $120000 jordan export contract
that was steel ' s best achievement
mr park was amazing then
yeah ?
he was an assistant manager
and in charge of communication with the site workers
he was hands down the contract pro
that ' s when things started to get risky
let ' s take him
he ' s a part of sales team 3 now
we should accept our members no matter what
it ' s your frigging luck
come on
support him well with the halal item starting tomorrow
be patient
you ' re good at that
being patient
huh ?
mr oh i don ' t like that either
geu rae what ' s with you ?
of course you can be told off for lacking skills at work
but personal insults are a different issue
you should say no if you don ' t like it
people would think you have no pride
support him well with the halal item starting tomorrow
be patient
you ' re good at that
being patient
i don ' t like that either
geu rae what ' s with you ?
of course you can be told off for lacking skills at work
but personal insults are a different issue
you should say no if you don ' t like it
people would think you have no pride
jumping down a bridge doesn ' t mean you ' re courageous
i heard you only have a ged
ignoring a path which makes you want to jump down a bridge
and going your own path requires courage too
it ' s not smart to respond immediately when there ' s trouble
when you keep your cool while your opponent doesn ? t
ultimately gives them trouble
if you allow it i ' ll support mr park
so keeping my cool is the best way
to defend myself and attack others
hold on !
i ' m sorry
-hello -hello
oh it ' s baek ki
uh ?
baek ki
huh ?
what ?
uh ?
you were an intern with resource right ?
yes
what was mr park like ?
you must know since he was in resource ?
you want me to badmouth my boss ?
no
i ' m sorry if that ' s how you took it
he ' ll be a bit
hard for you to handle
i can imagine how he treats you
but don ' t take it personally
that will make it easier for you
just ignore him
it ' s the halal meat distribution list
already ?
wow
you ' re really unqualified but a competent newbie
how did you find it ?
i got the contacts from another team who did a halal item
i called the arab-related companies and asked if they could do it
i ' m impressed
i ' ll be asking for easy support
but you should know the basics
basics i mean the basics
you should know the trade terms for example
you know what as is ?
we ' re not talking about after-sales service
they ' re conditions to provide when a promissory note is presented
i ' m impressed
volume rate ?
a discount on large freight
it ' s a cheap rate you apply on the transport charges
as the number of containers increase
knockdown
a method of assembling and selling a machine in parts
the custom rate is higher than the parts and it ' s economical
for nations with low labor costs so it ' s profitable for the importer
w/m
a standard for transport charge calculation
whether to use weight or volume is the ship company ' s choice
hello mr jang
we consider halal food to be contaminated when they come into contact
with any non-halal food
i understand the packaging process
but not the storage procedures
please provide us with the specifics
for the storage procedure for your suggestion
how will you reply to that buyer ' s request ?
you don ' t understand ?
english is a basic skill for a trading company
what should we do about him ?
there ' s no solution
good job
so childish
arrogant jerk
yes mr kang
bye
baek ki
mr kang said he can ' t come today
ok
-hello -hi
mr kang is coming right ? when ' s he coming in ?
he can ' t come in today
he can ' t ?
what should i do ?
what ' s going on ?
the epc tf budget changed
finance needs approval from each team today
steel will need to submit it too
can you do it ? it ' s not hard
what ?
the whole report is complete
so just summarize that into 5 pages
just prepare the revised budget and timetable
mr kang won ' t like it
i ' ll call him now
would you like some coffee ?
i ' m fine
i ' ll answer it
one international jang baek ki speaking
it ' s me
i heard from mr yu in resource
can you take care of it ?
yes sir
ok
i hope you don ' t do a bad job just because you ' re quitting
thanks
mr park
i ' ve completed the butchery and certification research
according to type and nation
leave it there
hey
could you massage my shoulders ?
it hurts so much so massage them will you ?
i wonder why they ache so much

it ' s fine
it ' s so soothing
hey

why are you so good ?
wow you can make a living after you quit
mr oh
he ' s so good
that ' s enough
geu rae has a lot of work to do
it won ' t take long
that ' s enough
that ' s enough
i feel good now
geu rae

geu rae

yes
i changed my team
geu rae
let ' s talk
is it because of your name ?
huh ?
you just keep saying  " yes "  to
everything because that ' s what  " geu rae "  means ?
if you can ' t do it say " no "  since it ' s ok
i ' m not just talking about mr park
once you start working your true colors are bound to show
when you face frustrations
but not in your case
you always obey without a single complaint
it seems like you ' re ready to accept anything
like a long-term prisoner who was released
like you ' re struggling to adjust to society ?
that was too much
i ' m sorry
but you ' re really like that
i don ' t know your past
i just know you have a ged and haven ' t done anything so far
what kind of past can make you this
cooperative and self-sacrificing ?
you know ?
i want to get to know you
better in the near future
see you soon
get some sleep
you worked all night and coordinated the breakfast
did you get any sleep ?
i ' m ok sir
assistant managers usually take care of the breakfast
good job
mr sung must have it hard too
working all night and the business trip too
working all night ?
why did he volunteer to go on the unnecessary business trip ?
unnecessary business trip ?
i wonder how far the canada polyester items are coming along
you don ' t know about his item right ?
oh i know ?
hello sir
i ' m back

you ' re saying i gave my work to you ?
-in some ways ? -hey !
new generation newbies are no good
can ' t you help your senior ?
also i ' m training you i didn ' t give you my work
watch what you say !
baek ki
we got a reply for the report to finance
alright
what ?
no reason for finance to hold off on it ?
kim sun joo ?
" no reason for finance to hold off
on it "  is the way she words it
it means you should find the reason yourself
it means the basics are missing or it ' s good
but something key is missing
that ' s the usual case
i see
i ' m sure you have the basics
double-check what ' s missing
yes sir
thank you
it means the basics are missing or it ' s good
but something key is missing
dang basics

a tormented maid
a stressed out guy
as well as me
gosh
dang young yi
attack them
what did i say ?
you have to be strong
you know what they say ?
it ' s not smart to respond immediately when there ' s trou ?
when you keep your cool while your opponent doesn ? t
ultimately gives them trouble
what ' s he saying ?
hello ?
i ' m lee ji hyun at headhunting firm search & brains
i called to confirm your interview for tomorrow
it was tomorrow wasn ' t it ?
i can make it
no i ' ll take a day off
bye
sit down
i heard you got rejected by finance
yes
also you don ' t know why
right
i just went there
is this it ?
yes
you shouldn ' t write out the schedule like this
make a chart for the approval format
you should have calculated the man month
you only have the cost and you don ' t know how many people
you need to calculate it
this new format is mighty refreshing
what ' s this new format ?
didn ' t you learn our format during training ?
submit a revised version
finance keeps mentioning it
i guess the smiling masked witch is nagging them
-keep it up -thank you
-refreshing -thank you
even geu rae doesn ' t do that
mr oh
i ' ll see you tomorrow
-see you -bye
geu rae
you should go home too
ok mr oh
geu rae
-young yi -getting off work ?
yes
what a long day
yes
i ' ll see you tomorrow
sure
ged !
getting off work ?
yes
times have changed
you ' re leaving at 6 sharp
mr park see you tomorrow
look at you
hey
if she gets married she ' ll be like ms sun
if she doesn ' t she ' ll be like ms kim sun joo right ?
see you tomorrow
i ' ll see you tomorrow
it seems like you ' re
ready to accept anything
like a long-term prisoner who was released
like you ' re struggling to adjust to society ?
a long-term prisoner who was released
what ' s wrong with that ?
i ' m showing everything now
why is the past necessary ?
what ?
where are you mr kim ?
the subway station
could you wait for me ?
why ?
i have something to show you
oh
this way
great view
tiring isn ' t it ?
it ' s ok
my house
-here ? -yes
hi mom
you ' re early
have dinner
i cooked mackerel
i made a mistake and the tail smells fishy
it ' s always smelly
so let ' s decide who will eat the tail now
don ' t think the mom should always eat it
let ' s do rock paper scissors
this is my team ' s mr kim
hello ma ' am
oh
your boss is here
did you have dinner ?
i ' m fine i ' ll leave soon
he wanted to show me something
show him what ?
maybe a hidden bride or something ?
maybe not
why you !
what are you up to ?
what are you up to to have
such dirty rumors spreading ?
ma ' am !
that was a joke !
-joke ? -yes
that was a joke
-i know -yes
-huh ? -i was joking too
this is what i call a real joke
you should work on your jokes
it ' s neither funny or touching
let ' s go in mr kim
let ' s eat mom
i ' m sorry ?
excuse me
i ' m so full
i hope you liked it
oh it was so good !
i ' m glad to hear that
yes
oh ?
it smells too fishy
yeah ?
then i ' ll just eat it
i ' ll ?
i thought your taste could be different
but why ?
-then enjoy your time -bye
the tail i should ' ve eaten that
that ' s her type of joke
she thinks it ' s funny but it ' s not at all
joke ?
yes don ' t worry about it
joke
right
-i have a question -yes
why is your place so vacant ?
i threw everything out
a released long-term prisoner doesn ' t need a lot
i was out of line
i ' m sorry
remember i said sorry
i threw out a lot but there ' s still a lot left
what ' s with this go board ?
i used to play go
go ?
yes
my uncle taught me as a kid for fun
i must have seemed to have talent
i entered the real world
the real world means a world just for go
i only had friends in the go contest world
i played go for over 10 hours a day
that was my teenage life
i wanted to be a professional player
of course i failed and met you
i threw out almost all
i had except one thing
these are the basics of all the games i played
can i see ?
yes
i wrote down reasons for each success or failure
then my master would write this
i started this since i was 11
it reminds me of everything at that time
you ' re amazing
amazing
what ' s this ?
the circumstances of the company
-circumstances ? -yes
it ' s like a diary and
each day is a game of go
why are there so many pages for this day ?
it ' s like a one-to-multiple-players game
usually you play against one player
sometimes a pro will play
against a bunch of amateurs
the pro usually wins them all
i learned one-to-multiple-player games exist in society
the difference is
the amateurs have to play against many too
i play with you
i play with mr oh
i play with other depts
i also play with competitors
one day
i ' ll have to play against the company
i ' ll show you a trick
when you play go
when amateurs play with pros
they start off with 4 or 8 extra points
in reality the pros start off with
extra points instead of the amateurs
the pros begin with 4 8 or
a countless number of points
what ' s scarier is that the
amateurs '  rules don ? t change
amateurs '  rules ?
you need to put in extra
in my case especially i can ' t beat ?
make it maintaining the status quo
new employees ?
they have to create results although
they don ' t have experience
how did you come to our company ?
i have a sponsor
it ' s a small firm called seong won
he ' s the president there
he ' s acquaintances with mr choi
so the executive director pulled some strings
that ' s why mr oh ?
get out
get out man !
you have great connections
he probably doesn ' t even remember
i never saw him personally after i came
why couldn ' t that sponsor
help you earlier ?
he did
i worked for him right after i got my ged
why did you quit ?
at that time ?
at that time i didn ' t hide my past as a go player
they were interested in it at first
then they became suspicious
it led to uncomfortable conviction
" he ' s inflexible because he played go "
" that go player always goes by the book "
i barely worked for a year and served in the army
that ' s why you hid your past ?
because you might seem like a failure ?
you ' re not a failure
as a community college graduate it was hard for me to get a job
after i passed and came to work
it felt like i had simply opened a door not a success
i think we keep opening doors our whole
lives instead of succeeding or failing
then what ' s success ?
wouldn ' t it depend on what
meaning you give to that moment ?
sometimes contracts you couldn ' t
seal make you feel fulfilled
would that mean a failure ?
sometimes you fail in go matches but you feel good
would it be something like that ?
i ' m not sure but
i guess so ?
let ' s start anew starting tomorrow
thank you
i actually have a twitter id
i was never really active
you want to join too ?
follow me
i read somewhere not to use sns with bosses
bye
face ?
never mind
good night
just go back home geu rae
see you tomorrow
haven ' t you learned anything in our team ?
i think it ' s time for me to apply what i ' ve learned
i ' ve learned the basics in school
as an intern and work training
if the basic skills are so important
why didn ' t you tell me from the start ?
i gave you many chances to see your own mistakes
teaching me the basics is just an excuse
i think you just don ? t like me
just attack them
regardless of hierarchy
hello ?
baek ki
didn ' t you call regarding the budget plan ?
yes
which part ?
it was rejected because i lacked the basics
you didn ' t add the man months did you ?
right
how do i add them ?
it ' s $8000 for the 4-month project
categorize it as four mid-level people
it ' s usually calculated as $4500 per person
calculate it as manpower
you forgot the piping map didn ' t you ?
piping map ?
we made one before but the agency sent a revision
we need to reflect that
there ' s an attachment which you can ask ms shin about
yes so that needs to be reflected in the timetable and budget too ?
right
use the company ' s format including
margins like i told you before
let them know the percentage difference from last time
baek ki
yes
see you tomorrow
yes
i don ' t know what is shown
but the world is full of those who want to be seen
i wonder why people confess about themselves
in the game of go the parts are determined by the whole
the rules in the world of go are already set
if the go board ' s possibilities are infinite
if the world ' s possibilities are infinite
is it possible to win or lose ?
really ?
i ' m determined by this whole land
people show themselves to be
comforted and understood
i have to put up with this ?
it ' s always crashing
dang
i can ' t ?  work with
you anymore like this
what ?
mr park is good
i can ' t believe this
-keep an eye on your subordinates -hey !
-doesn ' t he work there ? -i don ' t know ?
let ' s find out what ' s going on we ' ll find out
you don ' t know anything man
let ' s have a proper dinner
baek ki
please
-drop it -geu rae
you jerk ?
episode 10
-hello -oh
hi
gosh
you ' re enjoying coffee amongst yourselves ?
coffee served by women taste the best
right ?
come on in this time and age ?
i can ' t drink this
ms shin i ' d appreciate a cup from you
sure
thank you
great shape
what ?
i mean this car
nice shape
-right ? -yeah
useful
useful engine
come on give me some coffee
come on hurry up
when will i ride a useful car like this ?
i ' ll report him for sexual harassment
what ' s going on ?
ms sun
mr oh !
oh !
keep an eye on your subordinate
a team leader shouldn ' t let mr park act like that
what ' s going on ?
the stock market ' s always crashing
i can ' t work with you like this anymore
what ?
you ' ve become a part of the team and i
wanted us to work hard and be successful
but i was hoping for too much
what are you talking about ? i ' m not getting it
i ' m saying let ' s just work
but not as a team
suit yourself
i ' ll put up with negligence at work
verbal abuse to the weak
and sexual harassment of women
i won ' t let that happen
i won ' t let it go
sexual harassment ?
ms sun came and told you ?
the first draft was made for the halal item so geu rae will wrap it up
since you ' ve adjusted to the team do your thing now
decide on a good item
geez
gosh
then i ' ll continue with my jordan used car item
it brings in the profits
ok then expand it
what ?
you ' re only looking at used automobiles right ?
the future of jordan construction looks bright too
expand into heavy equipment
-expand it ? -yeah
first send the materials so we can share them
mr kim !
hi is that coffee ?
yes
why didn ' t you ask someone instead of coming yourself ?
your coffee used to be awesome
it was thick and sweet it was like my tonic for the day
i heard you ' re going to expand the jordan used car business
yes i ' m reviewing the documents
it ' s not a bad idea
you can bring in bigger profits through products including tires and batteries
yes a market is being formed as they sell them to surrounding countries
see ?
mr park is useful to the company
you can get credit thanks to him
young yi clean this
yes
-over there too -yes
also organize the supply box
it took a while to find a pen
yes
young yi coffee
yes
why do you keep giving me coffee mixes ? i want mine black
don ' t you know that by now ?
yes sir
is that the halal contract ?
oh yes
what ' s with your expression ?
nothing sir
it ' s strange isn ' t it ?
what ?
you want me to tell you what ' s strange ?
you can ' t see the selfishness of a big company
what ?
it ' s ?
like that ?  here
what are you doing ?
you were so deep in thought ?
i told you you should ' ve come to our team
you want me to trip mr ha again ?
no
what ' s your concern mr oh ?
you know thinking about the next item
i ' m thinking of expanding
mr park ' s jordan used car business
i saw the proposal once
yeah ?
yes
what did you think ?
what ?
you thought it was weird too
yes i knew you would ' ve noticed
mr oh excuse me
ok
that guy ?
isn ' t he mr shim at samjung ?
you froze when you saw him
in the lobby and ran away
no sir
i caught on
why this newbie was so talented
i don ' t know what ?
-please excuse me -go ahead
why ' d you want to come out so far ?
mr park ' s jordan used car business
have you seen it ?
no
i was going to
the documents won ' t have any issues
since legal and finance have reviewed it
if you read it carefully though
you ' ll see ?  something you can ' t understand
what ' s that ?
their company ' s profits are set so high
that ' s true
their size and performance suddenly excelled around the contract period
the special profit share among the net profit
on the financial statements are too high
mr park got that kind of company
and their profits are set too high
then ?
you get it don ? t you ?
he gets a back margin ?
mr park ?
who knows ?
so let ' s find out
whether our team member is a lazy pig
or a troublesome mad dog
i shouldn ' t have bought this one
i ' m glad i bought you at least
yeah
what ' s with the atmosphere ?
it ' s just so weird
excuse me
great acting
how dare he ?
twenty 1bs
give me a 3d pipe
here you go
what ' s with these storage samples ?
pipes of different sizes are mixed in
i ' ve told you many times
how can you find anything when you need something urgently ?
i ' ll organize them now
leave it i ' ll do it
you can go work on the contract ms shin
yes sir
i could hear you get told off from outside
it seems you ' re using my method
acting as a servant
did you give up on yours ?
hello ms lee
yes
i decided to stay at my company
will you have a sandwich for dinner again ?
what ?
let ' s have dinner
i ' ll treat you properly
since you ' ll be staying ?
why don ? t you treat all the newbies ?
no
i don ' t want to announce i wanted out
i ' m regretting telling you big time
come here suk yool
suk yool
i can put up with incompetence
but i can ' t put up with rude subordinates
you didn ' t greet me once today
suk yool
is something wrong ?
tell me if something ' s troubling you
sir
you really don ' t know why i ' m like this ?
how should i know your personal affairs ?
this isn ' t right you ' re at work now
you don ' t take work back home
you shouldn ' t bring personal stuff to work either !
i don ? t know what ' s going on
but get a grip
also organize the polyester item soon
mr sung
what ?
i ' ll take a half-day off today
i can ' t sit down because of my headache
hey did you have a meeting ?
you should clean up if you ' re done
where ' s young yi ?
young yi clean this
yes
oh right
young yi
go get my shoes from the repair center
also get me liquid digestive medication on the way back
-shoes and digestive medication -yeah
buy me a pack of cigarettes
you know what i smoke right ?
yes
-i ' ll be right back -ok
mr yoo what are you doing ?
she said she ' d run my errands not clean up after you
i just ?
don ' t you think it was too much ?
we just ? wanted to help you
dang
hey
i ' m suspicious of his intentions regarding young yi
what ?
intentions ?
he really ?
i think he thinks of her as a personal maid
we ' re trying to train her officially
he just slaves her around personally
that ' s not right
he shouldn ? t do that
sir
why that ?
young yi
go to pyeongtaek now
what ?
make sure the fertilizer in the seobu chemicals storage room is sent
to the container yard in incheon port by tomorrow morning
that is set to take off in five days
just do what i say
we should move them when there ' s time
it ' s the container yard free demurrage period so take care of it
shall i call seobu ?
i already told them we ' d go anytime this week
yes sir
you don ' t have to come back to the office after that ' s over
where are you going ?
oh
it ' s the completed report for the tf item
decided to stay ?
mr kang is a good guy
do a good job
yes sir
-i ' ll get going -sure
you told me to give you what i have
why is there no comment on that ?
do you want to do it or not ?
i ' m a meticulous guy
i created everything why read between the lines ?
you should make progress when you should
that ' s why your team only does little jobs
come out now
hey
what is it ?
what are you talking about ?
you guys are trying to ruin mine aren ' t you ?
what is it ?
tell me
you ' re just sang sik ' s boot licker
would you die if he asked you to ?
don ' t trust him too much
he ended up killing a female employee who liked him
he keeps hypnotizing himself that it wasn ' t his fault
when everyone knows about it
how could you say that ?
look at you talk
look at your real side
now you ' re taking his side ?
you want to use his connections ?
get on the side that will help you
you should get with either the president
or the executive director
that fool mr oh is nothing
he ' s just useless
you know what i ' m saying ?
you don ' t know anything dude
if you understood go tell him to hurry with it
i ' m on my way to pyeongtaek for work
let ' s have dinner next time
i feel like i can breathe now
why are you coming along ?
i like being at sites
close it or dust will come in
yes
strike ?
why didn ' t you call before coming ?
we called right ?
yes no one answered
there was no time so we just came
i ' m sorry the office must have been vacant
we ' re so busy too
what should we do ?
hold on please
please leave a message ?
resource team how may i help you ?
mr yoo this is young yi and i ' m here at seobu
i couldn ? t reach mr ha ?
mr ha ?
he ' s in a meeting he probably can ' t talk why ?
what ?
strike ?
yes apparently the freight strike started today
mr ha told me to get it done by tomorrow what should i do ?
what can you do ? it ' s a strike
just come back
if you were a guy we ' d ask you to rent a truck and bring it
-what ? -just come back
i ' ll tell mr ha
he said just come back ?
let ' s go we can eat on the way back
i know good restaurants in pyeongtaek
you have a small truck in the factory right ?
what ?
what are you going to do ?
you want us to move them ?
yes
us ?
400 bags of fertilizer on a 25-ton truck
we need to make 3-4 trips
3-4 trips
yes
i ' ll see it to the end
will it really be ok ?
it ' s ok
we ' ll return it tomorrow afternoon
ok
-thank you -sure
let ' s go
what ?
take it
i can ' t
what ?
i don ? t have a license
what ?
the exam period ?
i missed it as i was busy preparing for jobs
for that long ?
i thought i was fine
come on 40km ?
they ' re ditching because you ' re so slow
you said you have five days
that it ' s not urgent
i got the order from mr ha
he said to move them by tomorrow morning
you ' re so inflexibe i didn ' t think you were like this young yi
we don ? t know when the strike will end
we don ' t want problems with the shipment
will you move it ? everyone ' s going ahead
be quiet
geez
catch on ?
no he ' ll think he ' s just an outcast
you really think he doesn ' t know we ' re secretly on this ?
we can ' t do this for long
i think mr oh will make a decision soon
why ' d you review it for so long ?
how big should i expand it ?
make it as big as possible ?
isn ' t it weird ?
what ?
the subcontractor seems
to be taking so much
what are you on about when it ' s all over ?
you said you were going to expand it
they ' re not taking much
come on the data tells it all
it ' s not a lot considering this business
their performance isn ' t great
but they became independent from a big firm
the infrastructure is solid
that ' s the problem with big companies
they only look at the files
they think it ' s all good if it looks good on the outside
big companies miss the details and that ' s a problem
i feel uncomfortable about this
let ' s just forget it
you want to pry into others '  affairs ?
move
will it end like this ?
mr kim
yes
meet with that company
record what the person in charge says
it should be accurate since there will be an internal audit
internal audit ?
geu rae
go with him
yes
internal auditing will be involved too ?
it ' s a possibility you know
can we go to the company without calling ?
they could be contacted by mr park
this is tough what if the situation gets out of hand ?
-then mr park won ' t just ? -geu rae
listen to me carefully
we ' re trying to find out the facts now
whether it was done by the right procedures
even if the contract seems too much
it could be just for the people in charge
whether it was done by the right procedures is key
the procedures might be more important than you think
whether he gave damage to the company for his own performance
or for personal gain
whether the company selection was unfair those are the issues
the company will judge the results not us
we ' re not trying to ruin someone ' s life
all we can do is work on the process
the results aren ' t up to us
mr park overdid it to try
and control the results too
let ' s go
-hello -hi
how ' s it going ?
are you getting along with mr park ?
yes
treat him well
don ' t treat him poorly just because he was with us before
let ' s go
what ? strike ?
yes
it doesn ' t have to be done by tomorrow right ?
right
so i told her to come back
that ' s ok right ?
yeah
so why ' d you send her on an unplanned business trip ?
you clearly told her to come back ?
yes
i made it clear a female can ' t do anything there
oh gosh let ' s just go
oh man
let ' s just go ok ?
dong sik and geu rae are
checking with the company
mr oh
you know we ' re going through something that ' s been taken care of ?
yes
then it might not end with one person
things could get out of hand
it has to do with everyone who approved it
i know
nothing ' s for sure yet
i ' m just telling you the situation
if that ' s the situation it ' s usually right
individual reasons are just added
according to my experience rumors don ' t just end as rumors
be careful when you question others '  errors
don ' t hate the person or you won ' t be able to focus on the errors
disregard the person to look at the errors
that way you can question them and get honest answers
-ok ? -yes sir
let ' s go
excuse me we ' re from one international ?
what brings you here ?
don ' t hate the person or you won ' t be able to focus on the errors
one international must be very interested in this business
sit down
no
i ' ll go out
you shouldn ' t barge in like this
you should keep your manners around them
you must have many questions about the jordan item
let ' s go i ' ll explain everything so come
we came because we can ' t find out that way
hey
businesses are told through documents
i went through all the procedures
what more do you want to know ?
i need to know what the procedures were
are you on the audit team ? who do you think you are ?
just make it official
you ' ve never done it before
you don ' t know what ' s going on in the actual business
" procedures "  my foot
come out
what are you trying to do ?
hey mr oh
what did you talk with mr kim about in the meeting room ?
you guys have been tight and i ' m getting jealous
yeah right
now you get the importance of connections ?
good thinking
sir did you arrive ?
yesi ' ll be right down yes
hi mr oh
let ' s withdraw
mr oh
i think you should withdraw ?
i ' ll call you back
what ?
mr oh said something ?
he wants you to go back right ?
geez
gosh of course it ends up like this
mr oh isn ' t totally out of his mind
gosh
i ' ll drop it
i think that ' s the right thing to do
for you i mean the company
i ' ll take care of it within my team
regarding mr park ' s jordan used car item
i ' ll have him submit a proper proposal
with the correct profits
but please send mr park to
a different team for the proposal issue
just do it
go with the procedures
where shall we go for golf this week ?
where we went last time
hello ?
yes
yes sir
we ' ll go with the procedures
so the audit team will come soon
hey mr kim !
why make such a fuss ? i said i ' d explain it !

one international wants to send auditors suddenly
you ' ll have to come
yes
hurry up
also one international ?
i ' ll send a text
bye
what ?
what ?
what ' s the problem ?
there won ' t be any problems if we check and everything is fine
hey
no man is infallible
especially with big cases like the jordan one
what happened could be interpreted differently
you know ?
you said the audit team was coming
you were joking right ?
sorry i don ' t like playing games
i ' ll call just two people right now
the head of the dept and the general manager
dang
must i do this ?
i could kill all you guys by one phone call
mr oh and all his subs as well
you know ?
you ?
mr oh will be with mr choi right now
hey !
you ?
why are you doing this to me ?
why are you doing this ?
hello ?
yes sir
yes
yes
sorry i need to send an urgent fax
yes
yes
i sent you a fax
please send me a reply
yes
it ' s time to react to the trouble the opponent is giving
in such crucial times
we need to risk our lives too
the side who makes a mistake first loses
who are they ?
it ' s an important time
one must not be rash or hasty
if we ' re to proceed we must not make any mistakes
the results are clear
if the opponent doesn ' t die
we ' ll die
submit all the documents please
yes
here
each side ' s documents and account books were compared
don ' t you think this company ' s
profits are set too high ?
here
this is a fax that just came from jordan
as you can see
the jordan company chose ours
we can ask for a high profit right ?
that ' s true
from that perspective the judgment
can be up to the persons in charge
i understand for now
you shouldn ' t treat me like this mr oh
what is this ?
in front of a client ?
there must have been a misunderstanding ?
what ' s this move that i want to make though i don ' t have conviction ?
it ' s me
-is the general manager in ? -what is this ?
we ' ll take care of this soon
yes
excuse us
it ' s ok

what ' s your korean name ?
i ' m park sang joon
what ' s your position sir ?
i ' m the marketing director
the documents say you ' re the general manager
the documents are correct
i got promoted recently
please send us an executives ' list including the ceo
not the attachments to the documents
please don ? t hang up and just send us a fax
what ' s wrong ?
are we obligated to do that ?
i don ? t think we can ?
this is the confirmation process before legal procedures
according to our reviews
icv company consists of locals
according to the corporation register too
wait a minute please
we need to check the jordan company
who ' s in the amman office ?
call him and tell him to go to the address i sent now
ok bye
our dispatched worker will go there soon
please explain it to them
resource ?
hello this is sales team 3 ' s jang geu rae
-is young yi ? -she ' s not in
can you look into it ?
baek ki please
ok
i ' ll ask the audit team
thank you
are you a jordan citizen mr park ?
no i ' m not
then why do you use a local name
and you signed the contract too ?
can we consider this forgery ?
how could you all say this ?
how ?
yes i set their profits high
it ' s my responsibility and mistake
i ' ll take responsibility ok ?
i ' ll take responsibility by a pay cut or whatever
mr oh
will you leave them out ?
a move ?
this is so embarrassing !
? is decided by the previous move
businessmen have to save face !
it ' s all because i ' m lacking ! ok ?
in order to understand why this move was made
you must look at the previous move
this could happen during business ?
in order to understand why the opponent is resisting
you must review the previous moves
we always do business ?
what might have looked like a small
problem might not be at all
give-and-take we need to give first ?
that ' s what was going on
then they ' ll give to us too
i ' ll write a statement to explain this
then that will solve the problem
mr park was revealing it all
let ' s go to the company
james
the man named james at icv company ?
? is mr park
james park
mr park sang joon in jordan is your cousin ?
what ' s going on ?
what happened ?
it ' s his son
every crack is completed by the internal conditions
right ?
mr park
geu rae
you jerk
he would ' ve thought of it as compensation
park jong sik !
in 2008 a $012 mil export contract was sealed
steel accomplished the biggest deal by itself
mr park was in charge of communication with the locals
he solved every single problem and
helped the contract to be signed
ok ok what is this ?
it ' s the general manager ' s company card !
let ' s party tonight !
oh thank you
come on
you should be enjoying the night
what ' s with you ?
you should go to the end
right
go until i die
please sir
i ' ll treat you to a drink
this is no fun
they get all the money
i just get a salary ?
this won ' t work sir
excuse me ?
mr park
what are you doing ?
you can ' t do this
it must have started like that
he must have thought  " this is how you get compensated "
you can send 20% here
he would come to ask for returns
you should work on a big scale
just take over an old local company
get some reliable men in there
and you ' ll rake in money regularly
whatever sales profits come in are yours
you should get paid for your sweat
don ' t you think ?
he must have opened his eyes
and started to see the world
mr park
where ' s the boss ?
i don ' t know
why act busy like that ?
right ?
everything must have seemed silly to him
this apartment is much cheaper than the market price
nice location
he must have started to think
life was easy and natural
then everything became nothing
how will it turn out ?
i don ' t know
from an outsider ' s point of view the good triumphed over the evil
company rules work differently though
company rules ?
let ' s just be satisfied that we did what we could
how did you think of finding out mr park ' s english name ?
yeah
when i checked the fax there were
many parks among the executives '  list
when i asked what his business card said it was james park
auditing team ?
when baek ki asked the audit team about mr park
the names of mr park ' s father and this company ' s ceo were similar
how did you know he was park sang joon ' s cousin ?
mr park only has one older sister
his father has only one brother
so i assumed it must be his cousin
gosh i can ' t believe it
i think it ' s his cousin
wow
make sure no other companies suffer damages
yes sir
i ' m tired
you clearly told her to come back ?
yes
i made it clear a female
can ' t do anything there
yes
where are you ?
mr ha
are you home ?
no i ' m driving now
i heard it didn ' t work out
how could you just go home when things changed ?
i told you to go straight home as ?
what ?
what ?
what are you talking about ?
so don ' t worry
after i go to incheon port i just need to make two more trips
everything can be completed by tomorrow
you fool !
you idiot !
are you trying to screw me over ?
you crazy witch !
how could you do this to me ?
you moron
you don ' t have to do it by tomorrow so come back now
i ' ll get someone tomorrow so come back now !
mr ha is so mean ?
how could he curse at you like that ?
young yi
you still want to work here ?
why must we get treated like this after working so hard ?
where is the justice ?
we really worked hard
are you ok ?
you frigging witch do you want to die ?
what would you have done if you got into an accident ?
you know how bad an industrial accident is to the company ' s image ?
i ' m sorry
get out of my face !
i ' ll just park ?
beat it !
-hello -what ' s this ?
sorry
bye
the level of responsibility differs upon position
the head of the dept and general manager will have it tough
especially tougher if you ' re higher up
especially tougher ?
you ' ll be relegated to a petty position
if the police investigations prove the case to be bigger
you ' ll have to leave
people think we just wear neckties and work like a block in the wall
we think our actions won ' t affect society or the company
but work is our life
it ' s still a game of go
eventually
that ' s what cho chi kun said
succeeding at a game of go
doesn ' t affect the world
you ' re right
it ' s still a game of go
regardless of the world
it ' s still my whole life
what ' s wrong with you ?
so pathetic
why is sales team 3 involved with resource team ' s business ?
it ' s such a pathetic game of go
i found out the reason today
it ' s just a game of go after all
because it ' s still go
my game of go
because it ' s my work
because it ' s the world given to me
don ' t be suspicious just focus
you didn ' t come to our team for a different reason right ?
giving rewards and punishments is my job
mr choi will be in trouble
it will get uncomfortable
you could become a conman underneath the boss
if you play games at work
it won ' t be good
hello
hello
hello
hello
baek ki
have you seen geu rae ?
no
have you heard about mr park ?
i guess you haven ' t
geu rae …
geu rae what happened ?
thank you
i didn ' t do it for that
what what ?
what is it what is it ?
the audit team is here
mr oh we ' ll take mr park ' s belongings
yes
go ahead
what will happen to mr park ?
apparently it ' s the biggest scandal in the company ' s history
what will happen to mr kim ?
the concerns became reality
mr jung of resource 2 team was called as witness
mr park ' s bosses at the time
mr cho won jin and mr shin jae min were called as well
mr kim suk man was audited too
and …
… mr kim couldn ' t evade responsibility either
please forgive me this once sir
jong sik
yes sir
that was nothing right ?
a trading man could become a conman or gambler at times
yes because
you have to make things work
thanks for my daughter ' s wedding
excuse me ?
don ' t mention it
you came straight from the airport
i remember you out of breath
i hurried over from a business trip
yeah
you were that type of guy
a bit late but you always made it
but this time …  you ' re late
too late
i heard mr kim suk man already resigned
cho won jin => assigned to fabric chemicals
kim boo ryun => aluminum shin jae min => distribution center]
this is demotion
yeah ?
wow half of mr choi ' s men are sent away
sir
i ' ll contact you when things get settled you can treat me to soju
you …
you and jang mi
i heard you ' re getting married
yes
-ok see you at the wedding -thank you
you should get married soon too
thanks for everything
mr lee
geu rae
hello i ' m the new employee oh sang sik !
i ' m kim boo ryun
yes
thank you sir thank you
i ' ll ship the product right away
yes yes !
thank you thank you !
wow !
wow !
you ' re the best !
thank you ! thank you !
let ' s go hiking mr choi will come too
i forgot i have a get-together on the weekend
if you can ' t take what ' s given to you are you not willing to change ?
what are you doing here ?
why ' d you hit him ?
what will you do ?
what will you do ?
tell him i don ' t care
sang sik !
hey !
ok sure
go with the complete item
sang sik is creating a business now
let ' s encourage him
i ' ve been to your kids '  first birthdays
get funds and find a big item for the middle east
wait
take this
i bought dried eel for buyers
take it
it was so unfortunate
when you lose in go by a move to prevent a tie
you wonder what all the moves were for
even if you win in a small battle or war
if you end up losing
it was all seemed useless
if you win by a move to prevent a tie
you can see a different world
i was grateful to the stones in the war
enabling the victory of that move
every single move seems precious to me
doing your best in every moment makes
the victory of that move possible
missing a moment …
means losing the whole and eventually failure
when did you start losing the moment ?
mr choi
sales team 3 …
oh
hello
oh sir
sir
yes
i got the report
your team did a great job
thank you
here
it ' s a special incentive
he prepared it himself
thank you
thank you
how long have you been a manager ?
seven years sir
you better hurry
you ' re really late
-oh dong sik -yes
-good job -thank you
what a surprise sir
oh mr choi
they did a good job
i ' ll award those to deserve it and punish those who need it
that ' s my job
yes
geu rae
i heard you played a big role
no sir
instead of getting off work as soon as you can look around one last time
then you can minimize your mistakes
that ' s been my habit since i was new here
thank you
mr oh
yes ?
you ' ll be promoted next year
that ' s nonsense
promote mr oh to deputy head of 2 years
yes sir
i ' ll do that right away in the first half of next year
when ' s the personnel appointment of the latter half of this year ?
a week later sir
let ' s do it then
employees can only be compensated by
their salary and timely promotions
oh sir
hi
you ' re in charge of sales until mr kim ' s successor comes ?
oh …
yes
ok
bye sir
sir
bye sir
kids dad will be promoted !
really ?
really ?
-really ? -really !
hey do you even know what promotion is ?
nope !
he ' ll become deputy head
be quiet !
hey !
you even know what that is ?
nope !
then why get excited ?
you feel great !
yeah !
so we feel great too !
freeze !
sit down !
yeah !
oh yeah this …
it ' s our team ' s special bonus
special bonus ?
sit down
okay
there was that much to spend ?
since the kids are growing there are things to do
give me your wallet
why ?
use it wisely
i can use my credit card
you ' ll have to pay for others '  cab fare
it doesn ' t look good when a guy has no money
thin wallets are popular now
no one carries cash with them
ok then give it back
no
i don ' t go with the trends
let ' s see how much there is wow !
shall we order pizza ?
yeah !
geu rae
-did you complete the registration ? -yes i did
if you didn ' t you won ' t get compensated for accidents
-got it ? -yes
let ' s go mr deputy head
after i finish reading this report from the research center
manager oh …
i mean deputy head oh seems
easy-going but meticulous as always
our team was calm
no one mentioned mr park ' s incident
everyone was silent
it was probably because our team ' s
accomplishments brought unfortunate results
so i think they ' re escaping to work
deputy head oh is especially quiet
so all he can do is work
mr oh and the rest of our team can ' t feel the change
but you can feel how they see us
differently in the hallway
we didn ' t just scold
a negligent team member
we removed an infection of the company
but our team members were
viewed as whistle-blowers
' why couldn ' t you take care of it internally ?  '
' why pursue profit betraying your colleague ?  '
' are you all innocent ?  '
you can see online comments pitying
transferrees and mr kim who resigned
no one denied the fact
that they should take responsibility
mr oh called us to talk in private
oh
it will get more uncomfortable
don’t get stirred up
the important thing is you did what you needed to
don ' t ever miss that
mr oh created a guide for us
we agreed to it
we just have to hang in there
hey mr ha
i heard young yi was trying to move the whole load herself that day
how did you know ?
suk yool is telling everyone now
badmouthing you …
geez
i told you young yi is scary
i actually feel proud of …
you ' re good at russian
you take charge of the certification issue in russia
excuse me ?
i ' ve never met anyone as tenacious as you
if i leave you alone you ' ll disgrace
our team creating accidents everywhere
thank you
i won ' t let you off easily just because you ' re a girl
i ' ll work hard
why are you looking at the t/f report
that was already approved by finance ?
is something wrong ?
it ' s a bit long
it needs to be more concise
long ?
yes
in what way ?
there are many nonprofessional terms
above all if you thought you ' d
lead it you would ' ve taken full charge
that way you could lead the sentences
otherwise they become long and clunky
i get it sir
you don ' t get it do you ?
i ' m sorry
summarize it
what does he mean long ?
i think they ' re the same
where are the nonprofessional terms ?
i ' ve been trained that much
the special notice about the middle east course
notice
about
middle east
course
it ' s long
notice about …
notice about …
special …
about the …
issue ?
issue ?
middle east course-related issues
one of the biggest islam holidays
ramadan came to an end on august 18
ramadan ended …
someone will fill in for mr park soon right ?
yeah
a competent person will be able to change the atmosphere
i don ' t know if anyone will want to come
ms sun
yeah
can i have a minute ?
mr ma asked me to do something regarding the fermented bean paste
-what is it ? -i
i can ' t understand what he ' s saying
you know …
don ' t you need a certification to export it to the states ?
excuse me ?
what certification ?
for food …
us fta …
what was it ?
you know
i can ' t remember it
you know what i mean !
you know !
don ' t you know ?
you don ' t understand do you ?
go look it up !
by fta
you mean between korea and the us ?
what kind of certification ?
i ' m not talking about the free trade agreement
how did such a dense guy join one international ?
which college did you go to ?
that ' s why they should review colleges too
you ' re in ms sun ' s team right ?
yes
that ' s why a woman shouldn ' t become a team leader !
go find her !
i don ' t understand what he wants
give me the documents
i ' ll talk to him
is certification necessary for exporting fermented bean paste ?
or are you talking about fta conditions ?
you know conditions or certification or whatever
what is the  " whatever " you ' re talking about ?
we need to get food certification
to export organisms !
organisms ?
is fermented bean paste octopus or squid ?
what ?
i ' m sure you know since you ' ve reviewed it
it ' s a complete product that went through
the manufacturing process ingredient analysis fertilizer checkup
antioxidant use and colon bacillus checkup
it went through factory and sample checkup
what certification is necessary and conditions need to be fulfilled ?
if you remember what that
" whatever "  is let me know
we ' ll go ahead with the schedule
hey
i kept letting you go since you ' re a woman
you !
you should thank your husband
for putting up with a woman like you
two sexual harassment
won ' t end with a pay cut
what ?
what did you just say ?
hey !
why that …
mr ma will tell you if he needs anything
so just proceed as scheduled
i ' ll take care of mr ma ' s approvals from now on
so i ' ll take over anything he asks you to do
yes
when you spoke with mr oh
did he mention who would go to team 3 ?
i heard an assistant manager might go
why ?
i don ' t want to go to that team
i want to work under you for a long time
i can ' t send you
ms sun
the person to go has been decided
good news
mr chun is coming
what ' s he like ?
don ' t worry he ' s normal
he ' s experienced with the middle east although not as much as mr park
he used to work for sales team 3
it was his first dept as an experienced employee
i …
became exhausted by a bad boss
so we relied on each other
we worked hard under mr oh
lots of good memories
how are experienced positions and open recruitment different ?
first of all they don’t have someone like you
someone they entered the company with and can talk to
weak support base too
he wanted to come in this atmosphere
maybe he missed old colleagues
you have a big belly
mr chun !
you ' re already here
dong sik
i mean mr kim
-how are you ? -yes
hi mr chun !
mr oh
i came to say hello in advance i look forward to working with you
why are you so tense ? come on
you ' re acting weird
he ' s a newbie in our team
hi
i ' m jang geu rae
nice to meet you
you came to say hi and organized your desk ?
boxes …
you want to sit here ?
then i ' ll go say bye to my previous team
mr chun gwan woong age 37
that ' s my desk
he organized his desk as soon as he came
all the items were in place as if they belonged there
i thought the man taking mr park ' s
place would make things relatively easy
instead he created a tense atmosphere
-dong sik -yes
go to the life supplies team
for some samples with geu rae
yes
sir
what about the polyester case ?
why should i do that ?
wasn’t a half-day off enough why are you still upset ?
didn’t i tell you that ' s your job ?
come here suk yool
is that right ?
what is it ?
instead of a banker ' s usance you wrote a shipper ' s usance !
there are specific instances to use these terms in the polyester case !
if you had trained as i asked you to you wouldn’t get this wrong !
i ' m sorry i made a mistake
i ' ll fix it
fixing it won ' t do
listen carefully
people learn from mistakes
i want you to know how i feel
read some self improvement books
see what kind of seniors are good
don ' t get confused again
banker ' s shipper ' s you ' re not going to pay the interest
it ' s bigger than a month ' s salary and i don’t have money
banker ' s shipper ' s ok ?
banker ' s usance is paid by the importer
and shipper ' s usance by the exporter
suk yool met his match
mr sung won ' t be easy to beat
what ?
how do you memorize trade terms so well ?
aog
the starting or payment expiration point
for a discount is when products arrive
no hesitation you ' re like a vending
machine and i pressed the vending
it ' s easy to memorize if you associate the terms
it ' s just like playing go
according to you you should
understand the core of proposals
if you connect the dots you can find
out the company ' s size or characteristics
but you never get it and ask me again and again
you ' re like that
do a good job vending machine
i ' m sorry
it ' s ok
huh ?
mr kang asked him to do it too
what ?
making sentences concise
he always trains newbies like that
after that the reports
become much easier to read
what ?
why didn ' t you tell me how reports can improve ?
don ' t worry i ' ll make you throw up while writing reports
are you vladimir michailovich andreyev ?
the report you sent is different from our request
it ' s meant to set the emission
quantity by ton of co2 equivalent
the unit used is different
from what we had requested
did you make a mistake ?
yes i ' d appreciate it if you ' d revise it
-young yi -yes
go bring my shoes on the way
a pack of cigarettes for me
you know what i smoke
you bought peppermint instead last time
how could you ask her to do that ?
she has to send the mail
can i go after making some copies ?
why that …
oh young yi
geu rae
your fly ' s open
thanks for bowing
you ' re so cruel
how can you laugh when i ' m sinking in a swamp ?
-how ? -suk yool
what are you doing here ?
what are you laughing about ?
huh ?
i ' m not that happy
shall we have a drink tonight ?
a boss torments you in your face
a boss treats me like trash
a boss …
you know what ' s the worst type of boss ?
bosses that use juniors
bosses that slave juniors around
give you their work and take the credit
but you know what ' s worse ?
he …  doesn’t know what he ' s doing
i mean he ' s feigning ignorance
i think he ' s feigning ignorance
but everyone falls for him
how does he do it ?
is everyone pure ?
especially mr moon
is he blind or deaf ?
geez
answer your phone
answer it
hello ?
suk yool
han suk yool
what ?
i was wrong
i ' ve been thinking a lot
you must have your reasons for acting this way
sorry for not being considerate
let ' s have a drink
i mean let ' s have a serious talk
now !
hey man !
suk yool !
where are you now ?
go
why are you drinking alone looking pitiful ?
suk yool !
suk yool !
sit down
sit down
come on sit
gosh suk yool …
i know
-shall we leave ? -huh ?
yes
geu rae
your fly
you can ' t fool me again
it ' s true this time
thanks for bowing
let ' s go
why that …
i ' m a guy
so i try to be understanding like
a guy when you ask me to do stuff
newbies should do everyone ' s work
it ' s all your work suk yool
so i ' ll do what you ask me to
so it ' s all your work
not mine but yours
so you ' re making me
do stuff to train me
i understand that
so i ' m telling you now
it ' s not my work but yours !
your work
you ' re a total sociopath aren ' t you ?
repeating the same thing over and over again …
sociopath ?
i ' m a sociopath ?
so i …
i wanted to be mentored by you and learn
properly like the other newbies
so suk yool that ' s why it ' s all your work
not mine but yours
i ' m not saying i won ' t do it
i will but …
but you can ' t take
credit for what i did
i think you should be considerate about that
suk yool
yes
you ' re a real sociopath
please listen to me sung !
did you just call me by name  " sung "  ?
no …
why this …
you ' re not a sociopath but a psychopath
psychopath ?
i can ' t drink with you
i don’t feel like drinking anymore
geez
sir
geez
please pay
what ?
please pay
$570

" our kid …  "
last spring i wanted to hear that word

-my ears get red when i ' m hot -i see
it ' s true
oh
-hello sir -hi
i ' m in your team from now on
hello
hi
geu rae ?
yes
i ' ll probably give you the most work
yes
i ' m not uptight so you can relax
we can get used to each other
-yes thank you -sure
and …
uh …
what will you do about your hair ?
what ?
it ' s too long
i think you can cut it so it doesn ' t touch your collar
your bangs too
what do you think ?
i ' ll make my hair look neat
you mean you ' ll cut it right ?
cut …
why are you acting like the dean of the students ?
like back in school …
yeah
-mr kim -yes
-let ' s have a briefing -sure
let ' s go to the meeting room
i can do it here
we can catch up too come on
i know what you ' re doing
you want to check out our team right ?
come on i know mr oh ' s style why should i ?
yes
i ' ll be right back
are you kidding me ?
-excuse me ? -you think work is a joke ?
am i your friend ?
no
you should be tense around a new person
yes
leave our tough but fun memories of three years ago behind
don ' t take them with you forever it ' s pathetic
what ?
yes
uh mr chun
you didn ' t come to our team
for other reasons did you ?
not me at least
though i don ' t know what the sender was thinking
i ' m sure no one ' s criticizing your team
but you should know they ' re watching
they ' re staring
if you suspect me it won ' t be good so perish the thought
you guys didn’t do anything wrong you did well
but having people like that around is suffocating
nothing ' s happened yet but if
they need me they ' ll call me out
anyway get used to the circumstances
why …
… did they send you ?
i ' m going nuts
what ?
it ' s because we ' re close
if they send someone who ' s not close
who knows what your filtering will do ?
let ' s make it work out
hello sir
oh hi
let ' s look at the work progress mr kim
yes i ' ll send it right away
who was in charge of this ?
our team sir
this is the jordan case the one where mr park got in trouble
oh there are reasons …
let ' s see the documents again in the afternoon
-this won ' t do -oh …
-sir -mr chun !
yes ?
you ' re funny
work since you ' re at work
don ' t influence others that way
you know why people get addicted to games ?
excuse me ?
it ' s because they play games
if you play games at work …
… you ' ll get addicted to games first
let ' s go for a drink after work
what is this ?
yesterday ' s receipt for the drinks
why you …
suk yool
i want to say something to you
i was going to tell you but i
didn ' t want to hurt your feelings
what is it ?
you have to change your personality for social life
i won ' t repeat myself so listen carefully
yesterday …
… you seemed like a sociopath
fix it
sociopath …
above all if you thought you ' d
lead it you would ' ve taken full charge
that way you could lead the sentences
lead the sentences
lead the sentences
too long make it short
course …
make this sentence connect with this …
like that …
it ' s ready
so you can dip it into the cheese
here ' s the liquor
it was just the two drab guys and
now there are pretty boys with you
thank you
enjoy
do you still drink alone after work mr chun ?
sometimes
he was famous for drinking so much and drinking more at home
even if you love drinking if you keep drinking for other people
you ' ll want to drink on your own too
right
since you like drinking everyone
wants you to come and you go with the flow
you start to miss drinking alone in your underwear
right drinking beer in your underwear and watching baseball is the best
my hopes aren ' t even that high
i just want to get off work on time
order fried chicken for the kids
and just drink beer with them
let ' s toast
welcome mr chun
yes
let ' s enjoy our work
-like the good old days -like the good old days !
-yes -like the good old days
i ' m sorry for having various
thoughts before joining the team
i ' ll work hard as a team member
drink up
geu rae
any questions or requests for me ?
just ask me
do i have to cut my hair ?
what ?
cut it
if he doesn ' t reply it means cut it
he told me to straighten my hair before
cut it
you straighten yours
yeah man
you ' re joking right ?
no
we should think of visual images too
i ' ll start combing my hair too
for our team ' s visual image !
cheers !
hey
hi
i just came
are you going straight to bed ?
what ' s with you ?
you always drank when you came home
i drank today
you must like your new team
you were worried about the personnel appointment
what ?
yeah
hello
-hi -hello
hi
mr oh
we ' ll have to prepare next year ' s business proposal
yeah you guys have time this morning ?
-let ' s have a meeting -yes
i didn ' t know geu rae would take part
in next year ' s business proposal meeting
we ' ll be having non-stop meetings from today on
be ready
yes sir
-let ' s go -yes
-hi -hi
hello
-hi -hello
the whole company will create next year ' s business proposal
and prepare the budget operation plans
performance-related goals at this time
since a single business item is created
through many teams '  cooperation
you need to hold many meetings and write out numerous documents
we look at new items and old proposals
but it ' s not a simple job
dinner delivery
-let ' s eat first -let ' s eat
any update ?
i thought about it and i think an
investment business will be a good idea
sales team 3 has been working late for days
i ' m so tired
how many days has it been ?
my brain stopped functioning
you want me to tell you why your game isn ' t improving ?
you ' re too hung up on rules and previous examples
obviously you should
learn and study moves
but how can the game survived
only through unchanging truths ?
then what should i do ?
break the formality
be radical
radical ?
if you don’t break the formality
you can ' t become a pro
what do you think of the jordan business ?
what ?
geu rae
what did you just say ?
redoing the jordan business
you mean mr park ' s …
by the jordan business ?
yes
what are you saying ?
i guess you don’t know as a newbie
but you shouldn ' t take others '  businesses
don’t even bring up jordan
for the time being
if you exclude the corruption
i think it ' s a good business item
the meeting froze at a fast pace
why do they look so serious ?
hello
what ' s with geu rae ' s expression ?
getting told off big time …
why ' d you get told off ?
i wasn ' t
weren ' t you ?
mr kang
good
hold on
big news about geu rae
what what ?
i asked a hundred times
how could geu rae think of that ?
he just doesn’t get it
doesn ' t he know what the company thinks of sales team 3 ?
they think of them as informants
no one ' s comfortable
he likes adventures
adventures ?
he seems so at times though i don ' t know why
you fell for him ?
what ?
young yi you ' re overestimating him …
-are you jealous ? -what ?
what ' s wrong with him ?
-what ? -i ' m going to criticize everyone
got a problem ?
i ' ll have a twisted attitude from now on
anyway mr oh isn ' t going to approve
he shouldn ' t
come over
our team ' s meeting came to a stop
we can assume the anticipated debates and misunderstandings
and unexpected damages
but no one could easily reject
the newbie ' s radical idea
even if i ' m merely a newbie
they need a just reason to reject my idea
that ' s what a team is
but this proposal was …
… a bit unique
do you not want it ?
is it just bound to fail ?
is it something we shouldn ' t do ?
or is it something we can do nevertheless ?
it ' s something you shouldn ' t do nevertheless
everyone knows there ' s leftover business
but no one ' s saying they ' ll do it
they don’t want the misunderstanding of getting credit
from a different team ' s work
yes
even teams that have nothing to do with it
but your team …
that was involved in it wants to do it
right
are you crazy ?
that ' s wrong
then you guys do it
what ?
how did the newbie ' s words influence you ?
then should i abandon it ?
yeah
you should
there are lots to do aside from that
can i do it if there aren ' t ?
are you playing games with me ?
don’t do it you have a weak cause
yes it ' s a weak cause
if you must do it
you need a just reason
a higher value than the fact that
it will bring in high profits
i need a just reason ?
yep
geu rae
yes
let me ask you a question
are you going for the profits of the jordan case ?
is that why you don ' t want to miss it ?
that ' s not all
though i do think it was a good business
then why must you take over this business ?
i don ' t think our team ' s work is done there
it ' s not done ?
i think we were insulted
insulted ?
our company was insulted by mr park
i don ' t know if just reporting him was enough …
you don ' t think it was enough ?
i think we should wrap it up
wrap it up ?
we should utilize the company ' s manuals and
systems to make the biggest profit
we must make the business back to what it was
we were insulted ?
our company was insulted by mr park ?
if we eliminate the corruption …
yes it ' s a good business
since you ' re a newbie …
only a trading company ' s newbie could think of it
that ' s a trading man alright
ok
let ' s do this business
let ' s do it
why ' d you send me to sales team 3 ?
you still don ' t get it ?
hey you wanted to do it !
what happened to mr oh ?
take it as work
i ' m not ready yet
-aren ' t i better-looking ? -what ?
he ' s like a daredevil
it ' s like mr choi ' s cause
when were we too scared to do daring things ?
episode 12
let ' s go for it
there ' s a good market with potential
few people will be convinced
to be honest they ' ll think we ' re just
being greedy for performance results
don ' t worry about that just focus on the work
mr ma is on a business trip
so just make a report ready for him
he won ' t allow it
just focus on the matter
i ' ll persuade him
why are you silent ?
the company employees will think it ' s bad
honestly half of the men under mr choi are gone
if you do this they ' ll think you ' re screwing him over
aside from the politics just look at the work
is it a reasonable business or not ?
it ' s reasonable
since when were we scared to do
things because of politics here ?
-geu rae -yes
this is not right
i see
i understand why you thought of it
but it ' s realistically difficult
it could ruin the career we built so far
i ' m sorry
i won ' t say anything else since mr oh wants to do it
let ' s work hard
yes
if you think of something like this again
i want you to discuss it with me in advance
i think i ' m close enough with you for that
i ' m sorry
it ' s alright
let ' s work hard
yes
dong sik
we should find korean companies and jordan local buyers first
yes
the korean ones need to be able to secure used cars consistently
i ' ll focus on big used car dealers
in incheon gunsan and busan
ok
-geu rae -yes
classify the korean companies by size ?
no no
do that with mr chun
you don ' t understand financial statements yet
you shouldn ' t have him classify things yet
let ' s go over the companies that failed the bid last time
yes
where ' s mr chun ?
aside from the politics just look at the work
is it a reasonable business or not ?
since when were we scared to do things because the politics here ?
why are you sending me to sales team 3 ?
to work
go help them well and
help them succeed
you know gum disease ?
excuse me ?

is better or leaving it ?
what a frigging situation
please insert your bankbook
please take your bankbook
it ' s over now
young yi
payday makes you that happy ?
what ?
you keep smiling
i ' m a bit disappointed
i didn ' t know you loved money
what ' s wrong ?

-are you ok ? -yes
it ' s been loose for a few days

yes sir
steel team kang hae joon speaking
i can ' t believe the psychopath is calling me a sociopath
i heard you can ' t choose your seniors but what is this ?
it ' s almost half a year since we worked
all i did was find out
he ' s a psychopath
how could my life ?  be like this ?
you have luck with your seniors
should i go back to the site ?
hello mr chun
i ' m han suk yool in fabric
i admire you mr chun
you started with experience as a deputy manager of the sales team
you showed great teamwork and
were sent to life supplies in a single year
promoted to manager ?
suk yool
can you give us a room ?
what ?
-geu rae -yes
i like the vigor of newbies
but look around
listen to what others call our team
he ' s not that nice either
what ' s going on with geu rae ?
never mind ?
geez
you know what you got ourselves into ?
it ' s a common mistake made by newbies
you don ' t see the whole picture
you just keep going forward ignoring the politics and emotions
companies i mean organizations
are not that simple
i ' m sorry
make suggestions that you can take on
be objective
are you capable of supporting this project ?
it could seem like you just want to be a follower
i ' ll work harder
harder ?
you think working hard by yourself will do it ?
if it ' s that simple who wouldn ? t work hard my friend ?
a biggie
i admire mr oh
he accepted a newbie ' s
idea just like that
sales team 3 takes on anything that will bring in money
anyway they ' ll see the business to the end
geu rae always does that
you always compliment him you know
-do you like him ? -what ?
i ' m disappointed
you never compliment us right baek ki ?
when did i do that ?
you were against baek ki with mr park ' s incident in it
you complimented geu rae for staying
and baek ki for leaving right ?
that time ?
right
with ms kim in finance you eventually listened to geu rae
baek ki told you so many times not to go
but you just went
right baek ki ?
mr ha
i told you to just attack him
they didn ' t even ask you with geu rae as an example ?
the truck ?
you got me in the truck
and drove like a turtle
you always listen to geu rae right ?
don ? t you feel bad baek ki ?
geu rae ?
why do you keep talking about him ?
there ' s much to say about him
who else would think of redoing
mr park ' s jordan business ?
could you baek ki ?
hey
what are you talking about ?
sales team 3 is doing what ?
mr kim
dong sik !
what ' s going on with you guys ?
what ?
mr park ' s jordan used car business !
so sales team 3 is redoing it ?
we ' ll try it
what ?
" we ' ll try it "  ?
hey
how could you do it like thieves when even we ' re leaving it alone ?
thieves ?
then your team can go ahead and do it
hey !
i ' m not saying we want to do it ! we know it ' s a good business
who doesn ' t know that here ?
that ' s not why we ' re not doing it !
we set it up and we ' re not doing it
don ' t you know ethics or have a conscience ?
what does ethics or a conscience have to do with work ?
mr kim you shouldn ' t be like this too !
what can you expect ?
he was trained under a guy without business ethics
who ' s the one without business ethics here ?
tell me
you hid the b/l and blamed it on our team
you ' re mentioning business ethics ?
are you crazy you jerk ?
dong sik
you think this is right ?
mr oh will judge that
just ask yourselves if you can say that when you set aside corruption
what you jerk ?
i can ' t believe this jerk !
let go
let go man !
hey !
you think mr ma will give permission ?
you really think so ?
what will you do if he does ?
you jerk ?
what are you doing ?
geu rae
lift your head up
you didn ' t do anything wrong
we ' re trying to work here
there are no companies to work with
among the ones that failed before
they all lack in size and other aspects
ok
what are your thoughts mr chun ?
i can ' t tell just by the files
i ' ll have to visit them
ok
how long will it take ?
five days
finish it within three days
you go with him dong sik
get rough drafts ready asap
yes
will it be better to divide
the districts with mr chun ?
one person has to drive to work on the road
yes you should work together
-geu rae -yes
apply for a vehicle
yes
make suggestions that you can take on
are you capable of supporting this project ?
is mr choi in ?
yes please wait a minute
welcome
you ' re looking good
so it ' s nice working with
sales team 3 again right ?
the team is redoing
mr park ' s jordan business
so ?
i don ' t know what to do
what are you saying ?
how can you say that when the team
has decided on a good business ?
why are you asking me buddy ?
you should work as a team member
i remember that ' s why i sent you
gosh
life is tough
so tough
mr chun i ' m heading off
i ' ll pick you up at your place by 7am tomorrow
what are you doing ?
you ' ll hurt your neck
uh
i think i made a mistake
i ' m so embarrassed for making such a suggestion
without being able to take responsibility
you ' re ridiculous
you want to know what ' s really embarrassing ?
suggestion ?
responsibility ?
hey !
you said let ' s do this !
did i say let ' s do it ?
i think i was too easy on you
i ' m sorry
geu rae !
you different-quantity-and -quality-effort guy
from now on you ' ll read this
until you know it inside and out
just do whatever i ask of you
that ' s what a newbie should do
you don ' t think you could do 100% ?
then just do 80%
a newbie trying to do 120% is the worst for the team
geez
where are you going ?
to get water
oh captain jang to get water ?
please give me a cup too captain jang
run man !
what ?
why make me repeat myself ?
our team will be involved in
the mexico coal consortium
between samjung and the steel team
your team steel and we will have a meeting soon
oh there will be competition
with samjung for export rights
so be ready
mr shin is in charge there right ?
i heard he ' s meticulous
yes he ' s excellent
he was chosen as the trading man of the year twice at that age
yes he ' s amazing
he joined samjung as the youngest employee
it was shocking when he was promoted as the youngest team leader
he has won contracts over $015 bil for 5 consecutive years
he ' s the youngest head of an overseas corporate the best in the industry
i heard he has a fan club
i ' m a member too
you ?
aren ' t i better-looking ?
she ' s speechless
a consortium with the competing team
must be stressful for a newbie
yes sir
hello i ' m here for the upcoming case
long time no see baek ki
hi
young yi
you shouldn ' t leave like this
bye
captain jang
what time is it in jordan now ?
call mr cho
mr oh
call him
hello mr oh
i heard you got promoted congratulations
yes
the rumors have spread here
just hanging in there now ?
i need to find out the current status
can you send some data on related companies ?
yes sir
but mr oh ?
this is surely a good business
you don ' t want to waste
i ' m glad you thought of doing it again
but the issue is that rumors of
the scandal can spread widely
i know
i ' ll have headquarters work on the jordan government
i appreciate it
thanks
did mr kim ' s files come ?
yes they ' ll come right after the company visit
get it updated right away so we can have a meeting when they come
yes
where did they go today ?
they ' ll be in gunsan
good-bye
bye
thank you
it ' s not easy
there ' s no supply complex so there are many small companies
when we need a bigger size
a big company won ' t want to work with a conglomerate
not necessarily
it ' s actually easier to procure parts
so it ' s easier to package
let ' s go categorize companies with smuggling violations
yeah
there were many
let ' s do that
where are we going next ?
-it ' s ok -i ' ll drive
just do a rough draft and hand it over
geu rae will finish it
you think he ' ll do it properly ?
we have to trust him
aren ' t you tired ?
shall i drive ?
no i ' m ok for now
we have enough companies now sir
-yes -how ' s jordan ?
yes send it to my email
you have my card ?
that ' s great
the costs and companies are accurate right ?
it will be a lot of work
yes
please send the files within this week
we need to decide within a few days
no time really ? i ' ll call you in seoul
bye
i ' ll have to do it as soon as i return
yes
bye
we have two hours before checkout
shall we get some sleep ?
let ' s do that
mr chun
yeah ?
you don ? t like this business do you ?
you don ' t either
but i don ' t think it will fail
i know how you feel
you want to support mr oh
so he can do what he wants
this company is the best in jordan
the financial statements look good
good performance
their resale performance is good too
solid market too
you know what it means ? i can get a rough idea
except for the financial statements
how can you exclude that when it ' s everything captain jang ?
scan it for now
also review it again from the start
if the numbers pop
check by category
yes
the numbers have to pop
the amount unit dollar conversion have to be quick
geez
you can use all the help you can get
how can you be teaching him like that now ?
i know
young yi should ' ve come
geez i wonder if seok ho is doing well
mr ma is coming the day after tomorrow right ?
yeah
will it work ?
we ' ll just do our best
ha !
you ' re an ambitious boss
yeah you won ' t die for not
passing a business item
the problem is something else
with the concrete-like teamwork of your team
you could get cracks
why aren ' t you saying anything ?
i ' m a daredevil who only looks for risky business
come like the wind ?
what ' s with that bark ?
time for my medication
see you
the numbers have to pop
the amount unit
dollar conversion have to be quick
it should visually pop first
next are the numbers
get yourself familiar with the form
and continue researching the faults and flaws of that form
just like the game of go
i ' ll build a structure that is easy to read visually
but ?
did i succeed in go ?
i don ' t know if i can bring the rules
of a failed game to succeed in this game
can i do that ?
hello hi
where ' s mr oh ?
he ' ll come back soon
oh how was it ?
good
good job
i ' m sure you want to go home
but i ' ll need a report first
sure
there are many companies that are ambitious
let ' s go
bring it
took your medication ?
yeah hi
geez they ' ll stay up for three nights
gosh i hope they ' re not wasting their time
geez
another meeting
we ' re reviewing
mr chun and mr kim ' s list first
whether the companies are capable of provision
whether they have a good financial status
coffee ' s here
mr chun
whether their vision matches ours and if it ' s realistic
we ' re reviewing it thoroughly
i ' ll go ahead with it
captain jang
is there anything else besides coffee ?
mr jang
so i didn ' t introduce him
he ' s the team leader captain jang
a short break
everyone ' s laughing but they have different thoughts
the uncomfortable truth in the
uncomfortable atmosphere is being revealed
in the awkward laughter
hey sang sik
are you crazy ?
are you insane ?
this ?
yeah about that ?
it ' s like someone choked on a piece of steak and died
and you were standing right there and you gobble it up
must you gobble it up ?
it has to be revived even if it ' s not us
who are you to judge that ?
you ruined others by digging into internal corruption
and made teams suspect each other
now you want to gobble up this business ?
that ? s why i hate you you selfish jerk
forget it !
please go through our files first
hey
do you think mr choi will allow this ?
why stop him ?
excuse me ?
it ' s a good profitable business so why stop him ?
you ? re the head of a leading team
you should have better judgment
mr choi
let ' s do it well
you ' re lucky sang sik
you ' re under the company ' s spotlight as you wished
what ?
the company will be
briefing for your proposal
sir ?
mr choi and all the executives
will be at the presentation
it ' s a good chance to be evaluated fairly
it ' s not a presentation but simply a business item ?
simply a business item ?
you really think this is simple ?
what ?
now that you started it and things are set you ' re scared ?
no way
that ' s not you
what ?
you said you were so confident
get a detailed presentation ready by this week
this is stressful for mr choi too
if he says no you ' ll say he ' s being personal
but he can ' t say yes when it ' s not possible
so it should be a fair evaluation
mr oh
it ' s on a bigger scale so we should expand our size too
let ' s get our presentation powerpoint files ready
mr oh ? -mr oh
i know what you want to say there ' s no time it ' s too much
above all ?  i know what mr choi is thinking
but ?
so what ?
you want to quit now ?
no
we can ' t do that
we ' ve come so far
we should try at least
mr chun
let ' s do it
captain jang
we don ? t need your opinion
you need to summarize everything we ' ve reviewed
the info source should be accurate
you need to estimate the rough prices from the companies
most importantly
we need a strategy to persuade all those people
it ' ll take a month
you take care of the powerpoint sure
you ' ll do the first draft and presentation right ?
right
mr chun
get ready and call jordan
mr kim in charge of the middle east
will be in a video meeting from jordan
let ' s start
our team was experiencing a new sense of tension
a new set-up work has begun
what ?
the flight was delayed ?
geez how much longer will it take ?
isn ' t the samjung consortium meeting at 5:00 ?
yes this is just crazy
ok we ' ll take care of the meeting
so come straight over after work
bye
young yi yes
mr ha can ' t make it to the meeting
he already prepared files on samjung
export rights so you can go in right ?
i ' m not ?
we have no choice
think of this as a tee shot
and relax just do your best
-i ' m shin woo hyun nice to meet you
i ' m jung hee suk of resource team 2
you know kang hae joon and jang baek ki right ?
hello
hello
please sit down
this is our new employee ahn young yi
mr ha couldn ? t make it due to circumstances
hello
oh hi
ok let ' s start the meeting
this consortium is key in expanding
the business to resources
support will be given in various ways
we got added to be involved and from our team ' s point of view
i think some contract conditions need to be revised
i ' d like to discuss that before we start the meeting
it will be ?  very sensitive in many ways
i ' d like to resolve things smoothly
young yi
yes
it ' s about export rights
the share status changed after our team became involved
i hope you can reconsider how we only have
the rights for the previous shares
samjung has an exclusive contract
we performed explorations and geological surveys
yes samjung performed explorations and geological surveys
but our plant and steel teams were
involved from early on and took the planning
i don ? t think our role was small
the export rights were agreed upon during the original contract
the agreement regarding export rights you ' re referring to
was before our resource team came in
please consider that our company is participating in the consortium
because of samjung ' s lack of technology
we would like to secure the
southeast asia and domestic markets
fine
i ' ll consider that
i ' ll tell you our steel team ' s opinion
we ' ll approach this business in two ways
one is procuring necessary steel parts
when establishing coal mining plants
next is after development ?
thank you
thank you
the next meeting will be at samjung
i ' ll see you next time
yes
good job
-good job good job
let ' s talk
shin woo hyun
mr shin
sit down
it won ' t take long i have to go to a buyers '  meeting soon
i wouldn ' t have been so flustered if you ' d told me in advance

lobby i thought you might work there
but i didn ' t know you ' d be in resource
i ' m sorry
how ' s work ?
things going ok ?
yes
is it fun ?
yes
ok good
it will be like today from now on also
it ' s strictly business
i don ? t know
i don ? t feel comfortable around you yet
young yi
you did a good job today
i don ? t know who trained you
but he did a good job
i don ? t know who trained you
but he did a good job
good job
chinese or arabian buyers don ' t expect a female buyer
in any meeting with men always sit in the middle
yes

hey !
now i know what ' s worst about company life
having to see someone you hate every day
there are too many faults and lies
he makes me so frigging mad !
but the fact that bosses like those guys better
and the fact that he takes
credit for everything i do
you want to fight ?
how can a newbie fight ?
shouldn ? t you wait for now ?
what ?
you should start with waiting for fights
if the opponent is strong
" strong "  my foot
how strong could a deputy manager be ?
you don ? t know how to fight
you have to hit them first
you went for me first too
you just have to be ready to quit
this is just wrong !
are you feeling ok ?
what ?
yes
you can really drink
it seems your team keeps working all night
yes we barely finished our powerpoint work
i guess only the draft and rehearsals are left
now it ' s going to get tough
yes

sales team 3 here we go
mr oh starts his rehearsal on the
jordan business ' s outline and direction
i will start our business report presentation
your voice a tone higher
ok

the presentation pages mr kim
prepared for the rehearsal were
revised deleted and put into order
we checked expressions and
inappropriate breathing watching the screen
we made a strategy to persuade everyone
wait wait
surrounding middle east countries
including saudi arabia iraq ?
but i can ' t help feeling uneasy
? to the big market
what could be the problem ?
let ' s continue after eating
the value middle east countries
including iraq domestic market ?
why ' s it so hard ?

you said you were so confident
am i really confident ?

i knew it
why aren ' t you eating man ?
why are you here mr oh ?

you have something on your mind ?
you didn ' t look happy
i don ' t think we can persuade them with this
you think it ' ll work ?
you ' re not happy either ?
no
i ' m not really happy either but i think we ' ll be alright
we ' ve prepared thoroughly
you must think it ' s not convincing
enough in other aspects
like stress or pressure
other psychological aspects
i wonder if that ' s really it
what ' s he doing ?
he must be really stressed out
i ' m sorry
this is the 15th floor of one international
911 ?
we need an ambulance ?
come on
what are you doing ? is the season getting to you ?
i ' m getting coffee
i have a new cologne want to smell it ?
what are you doing ? get a grip
yes
mr kim
yeah
last time we were talking about work ?
yeah you have something to tell me ?
about the presentation ?
what about it ?
i feel uneasy about it for some reason
uneasy ?
who wouldn ' t feel so in this situation ?
yes but i ' m talking about the content as well
what about it ?
well ?
i think it shows how it could be bad for our business
what do you mean ?
nothing sir
go on
he was just thinking out loud
go on !
why do you think it shows how it could be bad ?
that ' s ?
? because our presentation is even
more like a manual than a manual
it ' s perfect and that ' s a problem ?
yes
you know ?
a presentation starts with the business outline
since we ' re following that we can ' t
help but sound like we ' re giving excuses
so ?
so instead of following the normal rules
we should be radical ?
geu rae that ' s not right
be radical ?
yes so ?
when you look at a map
i would say thinking
north goes up is a habit
wouldn ' t earth actually not
have an upside or down ?
so ?
australia is down here
if you go like this ?
it can be in the middle
you can see australia well
if you put it back to normal
you can ' t see it well
geu rae that ' s ?
starting with the outline is a precedent
if we focus too much on precedents
what ' s important might not shine through
yes
that might be it
i kept feeling uneasy too
mr oh
i don ' t know what he
means by being radical
but if you ' re thinking of changing the content
i ' m against it
you know we really don ' t have time to revise it
mr oh i agree with mr kim
i think we should choose and focus
not be radical now
i understand what mr oh and geu rae are saying
i do
but i don ' t think it ' s problematic
to bring in a totally new alternative
geu rae
go organize old reports
yes
you agree you must be convinced to convince others right ?
i ' m not convinced to begin with
so it sounds like excuses as he said !
the audience will catch on
do you remember the folder structure made by geu rae ?
we were trying to think within the structure
but he didn ' t even think about it
he just focused on the goal
instead of the team ' s existence
cracks or saving face
just focus on the goal of making this happen
whether we can take this road
or not
hi mr kim
geu rae
come in
make the situation in your head into a powerpoint file
i ' ll give the presentation
show your picture
give it over by tomorrow morning
we need time to revise it
mr kim i ?
write out parts you think
will take time by computer
this is absurd
sir
what happened to mr oh ?
it ' s not the mr oh sang sik i knew
he didn ' t lack judgment like that
he hasn ' t changed
what about you dong sik ?
you have to leave this team to succeed
sir you know ?
what are you talking about so seriously ?
your team must be so busy
is the presentation two days later ?
yes sir
i came to get some air and it ' s quiet out here
when you ' re sitting at your desk all day
you don ' t know when seasons change
when you grow older you feel
sad about losing the seasons
see you later
yes
geu rae
hello
i finished this ? i saw it
you should go to a sauna
i ' ll tell mr oh when he comes
yes
mr kim
i ' m sorry
i ' m not so sure
you ' re not wrong and
mr oh had his concern too
i understand the situation too
if this doesn ? t work out
i think i ' ll be really mad at you geu rae
for a long time
i ' m sorry
see you later
mr chun
mr oh good morning
yes
good morning
-good morning -hello
hi are you revising it ?
yes
mr kim revised the presentation
file i worked on all night
and rehearsals began
check the satellite connection
mr cho can you hear me ?
yes i can
shall we start the screen test ?
yes please sit in the vice president ' s seat for the test
you ' re working so hard
vice president ?
hello sir how are you doing ?
i ' m good
since i drink less than in korea
that ' s nice
what color clothes will you wear today ?
i ' ll wear a light gray suit
will that be a problem ?
that sounds good
the company logo ' s location doesn ? t look good
can you move a bit ?
is that ok ?
it ' s good
mr oh
it ' s a great business
thanks for not abandoning it
sure we ' ll start the rehearsal
we revised the presentation a bit
revise ?
yes please look at the new file
if you look at the second page indonesia ?
give me some water i ' m sorry
i ' m sorry
after listening to mr oh ' s final rehearsal i kept quiet
i ' ve never seen rules i learned
in training shake in reality
after seeing the radical change
i realized i was a part of the change too
and i became suspicious
i returned to my trivial self
-and ? -mr oh
will that be ok ?
sir
i ' ve never seen this kind of presentation
am i wrong mr oh ?
didn ' t you want to make this business happen ?
what have i done ?
what are you doing geu rae ?
praying ?
no sir
go in
yes
i don ' t think our team ' s business will work out
why not ?
i think mr oh is overdoing it
gosh
that ' s too sad
how about the jordan business ? what ?
i think it ' s a good item if you set aside the corruption
how could geu rae think of that ?
don ' t they know how the employees view the team ?
i think the whole company was insulted
ok
let ' s do this business
geu rae this is not right
make suggestions you can take on
are you capable of supporting this project ?
we set it up and we ' re not doing it
don ' t you know ethics or have a conscience ?
what ?
there will be a company briefing for your proposal
it ' s not convincing
i think pt shows how it could be bad for our business
what do you mean ?
when you look at a map ?
i would say thinking north goes up is a habit
starting with the outline is a precedent ?
but if you ' re thinking of changing the content
i ' m against it
we only think within the structure but he didn ' t think about the limit
this is absurd
but if this doesn ? t work out i think
i ' ll be really mad at you geu rae
what have i done ?
mr oh
why are you out here ?
let ' s go in sir
ok
good luck
let ' s go in
thanks
everyone will be imagining an
obvious report in their minds
they ' ll be looking for opposing points
or already be prepared
we can clearly feel how they
think won ' t go as expected
is sales team 3 ignorant or courageous ?
you ' re such a daredevil
mr park ' s case was resolved right ?
then shouldn ' t they end it with that ?
you were promoted with the ceo ' s
encouragement so aren ' t you going too far ?
right
ok
let ' s start
the ceo is coming
i was curious and i had
some time until my next schedule
i can join too right ?
sure please sit down sir
thanks
sit down
it ' s ok
mr oh sorry for interrupting
you can begin
the payment for the russian forest carbon emission case has arrived
please check
ok
so this business is on yes
good job
young yi is good isn ' t she ?
dude
sir
thanks
young yi
this is an additional business for minerals so just revise it
for tc use your name
supplier
excuse me ?
order info in the system for confirmed contracts]
you take charge of it
thank you
young yi hi
hello
young yi about sales team 3 ' s presentation ?
there was mr choi and all the executives behind him
the mood was just totally solemn like i ' ve never seen
it ' s like i peed and came out and it ' s freezing outside
it was ?  so cold
will that be ok ?
i ' ve never seen this kind of presentation
what have i done ?
just watch calmly
yes sir
please look at the screen
it ' s regarding the  ' 93 indonesia natural resources illegal trade
the indonesia branch manager paid
trade costs with retention money
indonesian currency for a currency
margin bringing a big loss to the company
declaration of war
a battle without guns has begun
why bring that up suddenly ?
what are you doing ?
in 2002 the myanmar tungsten export corruption case
in 2007 the singapore wine export corruption case
in 2011 the russia medical electronics export corruption case have occurred
in 2002 the myanmar tungsten export corruption case
bribery with the major stockholder me holdings
in 2007 the singapore wine export corruption case ?
the corruption cases i heard of during job training and mr park ' s incident
were dealt with in much more detail
with this export corruption case with the double contract
the commission was divided among them
and as you know recently there was
the jordan used car export business commission corruption case
there was a commotion as expected
they must have been reminded of the sorrow of filling in someone ' s position
which became vacant due to that case or those perplexed times
" so what about it ?  "
" what are you trying to say ?  "
i could read their faces
and ?
and the company resolved each
incident accurately in a prompt manner ?
but there ' s no stopping now
they ' ve been resolved nicely
and they ' ve been erased
what are you trying to say ?
what is it you want to say ?
our company was always like that
you ' re so arrogant
-what are you trying to say ? -it ' s over
-get to the point -mr oh !
what are you doing ?
why are you bringing that up now ?
we ' ve chosen to walk the path of not bringing up businesses that had issues
do you know ?
we ' re going ahead with it
what happened to those businesses ?
and going on strong
what is wrong with him ?
this is conviction
what are you trying to say ?
i wonder how many mental wars you need
to fight to build such conviction
now these are other companies ' performance results
for the businesses we didn ? t even want to think about anymore
shinsung earned $300 mil haesun made $270 mil
hw group $160 mil and hongjae $130 mil
these businesses are still stable
after the cases ?
please look at the expected profits
the expected profits for the businesses were announced
27% hw group
their approximate values and accurate predictions
it ' s nearly identical to the expected profits
please look at the stock prices before the business started
and those for two years after the business started
they ' ve risen along with the success of the business
in the game of go when the
opponent disregards me or is greedy ?
should the incidents be forgotten
since there has been punishment ?
if you use tricks as if to avoid battles even when it ' s important ?
we had only revealed the offenses
you need to chase it until the end
it ' s totally different from the rehearsal
if we ' re not on our toes we could totally ruin everything
he ' s taking a huge risk now
from now on ?
changing the tide a new strategy will be used
from now on we ' ll start the presentation
for the expanded jordan used car export business
from now on ?
changing the tide a new strategy will be used
from now on we ' ll start the presentation
for the expanded jordan used car export business
the goal of this business is to secure 40%
mr oh came back to the familiar one international presentation manual
jordan is a small country
you can see they have a tiny domestic market
it ' s in the middle east
but they lack resources including oil
but thanks to a stable political state and
their location in the center of the middle east
intermediary trade is developed
we have about 280000 exportable used cars
90000 are going to jordan
this is a large amount compared to jordan ' s population
because they ' re re-exported to iraq saudi arabia
syria and spread to the middle east
we ' ll connect with the branch manager
in amman jordan for current info
hello sir and executives
jordan has shown a very positive response regarding the business
having met a few companies
i know they have been extremely positive about it
they have stated they want to do business together proactively
you can see the lists on page 18 ?
as the presentation went on
mr kim ' s conviction was
conveyed to the executives
regarding the contract and i ' m sure it will be a secure business
that ' s it for our team ' s jordan used
car export business presentation
thank you
it ' s not bad
yes
it mustn ' t have been easy to take over the subordinate ' s job
who was punished because of you
so we tried to focus on the true value of the business
it ' s a well-prepared report
were you able to handle it all ?
yes the jordan team helped greatly
i heard the youngest member in your
team proposed redoing this item
yes the new employee jang geu rae
his name is geu rae ?
jang geu rae ?
i ' m not sure who ?
where is he ?
hello
hello
it ' s him
you ' re a daredevil
geu rae ?
yes
why did you think of this proposal ?
that ' s ?  that ' s ?
? that ' s ?  because it ' s our company
our company ?
our company ?
our company ?
yes our company
yes it ' s our company of course
it ' s obvious but somehow we feel shameful
i know
yes thank you
thank you
i hope you can succeed with the
jordan used car export business
thank you
good job
thank you
mr lee shall we postpone today ' s golf to another day ?
i want to stay at our company for a while
yeah
this was totally out of the box for a trading man
didn ' t you do something daring
like that 20 years ago too mr lee ?
yes i did many times
good job
thank you
you too
what ' s with you ?
get up you little fool
yes thank you for your help

mr chun

thanks for hanging in there when it must have been stressful
you ' ve been a great help
it ' s been ? great for me too
should i send an appreciation mail to those who were at the presentation ?
i ' ll do it
you send messages to the concerned depts and get confirmation
sure
where ' s geu rae ?
he ' s still acting like a naive fool
so i told him to get some fresh air
come on here is geu rae
tell them
there ' s nothing to say
see you ' re all arrogant now
so you ' re the first to have a meeting with the ceo huh ?
come on
you started to be arrogant the moment mr oh accepted your idea
congratulations
i didn ' t think you ' d pull it off this well
thank you
that makes me feel weird
it makes me want to do well so i don ' t end up like that
congratulations
thanks
congratulations
thanks
i ' ll get going
i have to send an email
me too
congratulations
thanks
come here
aren ' t you being too greedy ?
are you jealous of someone struggling from the bottom up
when you have great specifications ?
what ?
don ' t be that way
actually their team ' s incident isn ' t normal
they ' re trying to resolve existing issues
i think working on it so there are no
problems to begin with would be better
maybe it ' s some kind of deception
right
deception
we just have to reach it
see you ' re all arrogant now
so you ' re the first to have a meeting with the ceo huh ?
come on
you started to be arrogant
the moment mr oh accepted your idea
ms shin did mr kang go somewhere ?
what ?
what ?
nothing
you want to tell me something ?
uh no
that feels great
hello
you ' re off ? yes
good job hanging in there another day
hang in there tomorrow too and keep surviving
yes thank you bye

it ' s nice how the table is full now with these pretty boys added
four pretty boys right ?
enjoy
the chicken ribs are amazing here
eat up
gosh geu rae
now you get it ?
there ' s nothing we can do yet
i understand
you might not be able to relate geu rae
procedures might be much more important than you think
since they ' re a kind of promise
maybe people trust that promise and prepare plan and execute
i hope the people who believe that promise aren ' t made fools of
he really doesn ' t get it
doesn ' t he know how the employees view the team ?
baek ki
mr cha hates tardiness the most
you must be in a good mood
a first attack just the thought
of it makes me feel great
if it ' s right it ' s right and if it ' s wrong it ' s wrong
i have a resignation letter in here
hi baek ki
suk yool
it ' s me
i have a favor to ask
what ?
hello is this really baek ki ?
hurry up
i can ' t believe you ' re asking me a favor
ok

you ' re 10 minutes late
the favor ?
thank you
take it off
what ?
you can ' t go in like that
take it off and come for it later
you should ask your training boss for help
can ' t he do this for you ?
it ' s too awkward for me
awkward ?
then i guess you can ' t share your concerns with him
you ' re right
that ' s cold
although the psychopath isn ' t a good senior either
did you go to a sauna together ? what ?
then it wouldn ' t be awkward
don ' t ever go to one before you become close
why not ?
you ' ll die of the awkwardness
see imagine you ' re in a tub together
you can ' t get out first but your skin bloats just sitting there
even when you scrub yourself
it ' s weird sitting side by side
but it ' s weird ?  sitting apart like strangers
you can ' t do this or that and you
can ' t tell him he has soap suds on him
why can ' t you ?
then he ' ll think you were staring at his naked body
what ?
" what ?  "
a perfect crime
you ' re late
uh yes
get your clothes suk yool
yes
i told you many times the worst
thing for employees is tardiness
geez
it ' s because you ' re not good with self-management baek ki

you think think is a game ?
please tell us what the problem is
how far do you think the norway resources project has proceeded ?
as far as i know it just has to be approved ?
right it just has to be approved
but why isn ' t it being approved ?
the additional business you guys sent messed up the schedule !
just wait when you have to even if you have nothing to do
the local team struggles because you guys pretend to work
do you know what you ' re doing ?
a business game
a business game !
dang
gosh i thought things were going great for her
they say things don ' t work that easy
let ' s work

let ' s have coffee later
my gosh
i have to organize some storage samples
i ' ll get going
indeed there is no direct correlation
between your school grades and happiness

i ' m not asking for a professional analysis
i ' m curious what your next move would be

can i leave now ?
mr kang got off so you can leave
as soon as you ' re done here
yes sir
go relax at a sauna
oh ? you worked hard
thank you
bye bye
aren ' t you being too greedy ?
are you jealous of someone struggling from the bottom up
when you have great specifications ?
we just have to reach it
i ' m like this because i don ' t think i can make it
it ' s just me who ' s at the same point
don ' t ever go to one before you become close
then it wouldn ' t be awkward
you ' ll die of the awkwardness
see imagine you ' re in a tub together
you can ' t get out first but your
skin bloats just sitting there
is it hot ?
no sir
even when you scrub yourself
it ' s weird sitting side by side
but it ' s weird ?  sitting apart like strangers
you can ' t do this or that
i ' ll get going
oh bye

i never thought i ' d see you here
i usually wrap up the week here
i got all dusty after storage organization
ok
i ' ll get going
i ' ll see you on monday
mr kang
let ' s go for a drink
are you saying you ' re not motivated for work ?
my colleagues seem to be accomplishing things
but i think i ' m right where i started
and that ?  makes me think i ' m lagging behind
you won ' t suddenly feel like submitting a proposal
it ' s not that
are you jealous of geu rae ?
i ' m not jealous
but ?
i feel mad at myself
especially since you ' re not a temporary worker like him
you work for steel right ?
didn ' t i tell you before ?
the jobs for steel are fixed within the categories
you need to check and manage for smooth operation
you think fixed businesses have no work ?
no sir
you know our team ' s yearly profits ?
how much work the required manpower and related countries ?
a lot to do to ensure things to go smoothly after signing the contract
does that all seem meaningless to you ?
no sir
it doesn ? t matter how it looks to others
it ' s not flashy but doing necessary work is what ' s important
we might not see it ?
? but don ' t think it doesn ' t exist
the figures we decide on ?
are a big deal to others
you should motivate yourself baek ki
it ' ll be tough to survive if you can ' t do that
yes

be absorbed
you should always be absorbed
it all depends on that
that ' s the only issue
in order not to feel the weight
of time that makes you slump over
you must always be absorbed
but absorbed in what ?
either alcohol poetry or virtue
that ' s up to you
but anyway be absorbed
and at times on top of a palace stairway
or on the green meadow beside a ditch
or in your depressing room you wake up
when you ' re not absorbed anymore
ask
ask the breeze water
stars birds or clock
ask everything that passes by
ask everything that is sorrowful
ask everything that runs by
ask everything that sings
ask everything that talks ask what time it is ?
then the breeze water
stars birds and clock ?
? will answer you
" it ' s time to be absorbed "
sir
you have a girlfriend these days ?
thoughts on marriage ?
thanks for the good news
how much is it ?
-$50000 what ?
you look like a hard worker
it was a tough job but don ' t let that happen
i can be become a full-timer at this rate right ?
i can keep working here at this rate right ?
your names keep being mentioned
be careful with your body
that question is not related to work
you take this
don ' t hurt geu rae since that ' s like hurting me
didn ' t you say you ' d take responsibility ?
will you do that to geu rae too ?
episode 14
we had a new year ' s쟪ick-off쟭eeting
it was a huge scale with all employees participating

moments of embarrassment we had
high hopes about the jordan case
good job

hello hello
did you meet with ms ha ?
why should i meet with her ?
oh baek ki did you hit on any girls at the ski resort ?
i ' m not into that stuff
didn ' t you spend the holidays with her ?
young yi
you ' re supposed to hit on girls at ski resorts
that ' s nonsense
look ! look !
sure
you must ' ve been out for work
no i had a visitor here
are things going smoothly with the jordan case ?
yes thanks to you we ' re preparing for shipping
i heard your newbie worked hard
regarding the mr park and jordan cases
yes
he must be bright and full of vigor
you ' re lucky to get such employees
you had an eye for people
see you later
don ' t be too concerned about the mr park case
that was reasonable
thank you
but
couldn ' t you have told
me in advance about it ?
that ' s not too much to ask for
it ' s not too much
that would ' ve been nice
last year ' s welfare points will expire
so use them all
your annual leaves too
you know volunteering is reflected in your performance right ?
i like volunteering
but i ' ll only give blood
we don ' t count blood donation more than twice
you ' ll have education mileages starting this year
and you need to take at least 30 hours
that will include english trade and data processing
you need a minimum 80% attendance rate and test score
if you don ' t pass the education fee will be deducted from your salary
english ?
it ' s ok they have easy classes and
don ' t worry since there are many executives
lastly you can look at your contracts on annual income
your names are on the envelopes
i ' ll get going
the hr team ?
what ' s with them ?
mr hong have you finished your annual income contract ?
don ' t look at it
mr ha and mr yoo submit your signed contract today
yes yes
they set annual incomes and pay raises in january
of course that doesn ? t apply to temporary workers
it ' s applied the moment
the dept head ' s evaluation
and the team manager and employee ' s approval are complete
i ' m not part of the a/b/c evaluation
how much is your incentive ?
so tiny not even $10000
you had a great performance
yeah but what can i do if the boss ?
i want to be one of them
dang i work hard but the company doesn ' t acknowledge it
why don ? t we get a break ?
my family wants me to get married
i don ' t want new year ' s or thanksgiving
i have another blind date this month
i wonder why you get rejected all the time
can you research it and send me a powerpoint file ?
look seems feminine right ?
wow she ' s pretty
seems feminine nice
who got the highest incentive ?
after mr kang i mean
it ' s me
geez
like them
geez
you got married ? you can ' t get married this year either
geu rae
yes
the hr team presentation ended long ago so where were you ?
i ' m sorry
where ' s the file i asked you to organize ?
what are you doing ?
don ' t act like you finished something big
work like you normally do
i ' m sorry
you saw in the kick-off meeting right ?
what we did was a normal performance
of course it was tough but snap out of it
work as usual
mr oh
what ?
i just have to work like i normally do right ?
as usual
i ' ll become a full-timer like this right ?
no you won ' t
it ' s what the data is about
there are many college graduates who studied abroad
they ' re struggling without a job too
if you think of the money and effort they put in
it might be natural they get in first
they want elites so they look at
education gpa scores and talents
then they add points for special skills to be fair
they compare everything
the company ' s manual is very strict
there won ' t be any room for you
mr oh what are you doing ?
hi
let ' s get off early today
early ?
i thought it was my infrastructure
but it was just borrowed for a while
geu rae ?
what are you doing ?
nothing taking off for the day ?
bye
we got off early
shall we have a drink ?
what ?
it ' s ok
do you know
what i enjoyed most about work ?
i don ' t know
learning how to drink
i could forget
loneliness and tough times
i could also lick the boots of people i hated ?
? all thanks to alcohol
but what i regret the most ?
? is also learning how to drink
i don ' t think i was able to enjoy everyday life
neither did i enjoy leisure or a break
thanks
drink slowly sir
enjoy alcohol
it could become poison
cold mind and warm heart
if it ' s cold raise it
and if it ' s hot lower it
have a cold mind and a warm heart
alcohol can raise the heat
cold mind and warm heart
that ' s a familiar phrase for those who play go
have a cold mind
and a warm heart
as of today
i ' ll stop drinking
what ?
thanks to you i enjoy working after a while
i ' ve felt my heart beat that i didn ' t feel for a long time
don ' t mention it
i know you went through a lot because of me
i didn ' t even get to apologize
because i felt so guilty
having lots of work isn ' t suffering
i sent you to work
help them out and bring success to sales team 3
do you think i should take out
this cavity or treat it ?
i just have to work like i normally do right ?
like i normally do ?
i ' ll become a full-timer like this right ?

it would be nicer low like this
i ' m doomed
i made a reservation with summerset golf
for you and samjung ' s mr lim for the netherlands case
i never heard of that place
you ' re sure it ' s not a lousy place ?
you know how extravagant samjung was last time
it ' s the hottest country club now
when the thai prime minister came recently they went there
with the invited employees
yeah ?
i ' ve prepared an environmental gift with a marker
i chose it for its nice green image
for the course ?
it ' s all unnecessary we just need pretty caddies
that way things will go smoothly
yes but since important business will be discussed
i ' ve requested neat and calm caddies
but young yi

i went to the korea economic association
they kept mentioned you guys '  names
be careful with your body so that ?
that question is unrelated to work

young yi
what ' s going on ?
nothing
mr ma ?
it was nothing
hey !
young yi !
hey
you get a kick out of talking back to your boss ?
and you ' re giggling with a guy now ?
that ' s why i told you to be careful as a woman
i ' m just telling you not to get
involved in rumors as your boss
how could you talk back to me like that ?
you think you could even get married like that ?
i ' m just worried since you ' re like a daughter to me !
be careful with your body
why am i your daughter ?
what ?
hey !
then are you a son ?
what a psycho !
what are you looking at ?
what ?
you want to report this as sexual harassment too ?
why ' d you jump in ?
you should stand aside when a boss is talking !
it ' s because you talked back to me !
hey mr ?

shouldn ' t you apply some ointment at the medical office ?
i ' m ok
i ' ll be right back
wipe yourself at least

i ' m not a dandy dresser
oh right i should straighten my hair
that ' s not it ?
my voice would sound better low like this
my colleagues teased me before
uh ?
i don ' t like how you don ' t seem selfish
what ?
i think people will say you ' re kind
but it ' ll be tough for your family
you don ' t know what you ' re saying
i ' m actually very selfish and self-centered
i was chosen as #1 selfish guy
i ' m sorry
my dad is like that so i
know how my mom suffered
it ' s just about me i ' m sorry
uh ?

ms ha
ms ha
men who work at conglomerates
used to be #1 groom material
now men and women are both cunning
old virtues don ' t work anymore now
no they don ' t
as male chauvinism decreased sacrificial minds have too
now they don ' t want girls to rely on them
as more girls started to work
they won ' t open their hearts when they think
the life won ' t be easy with him
how good a person he is
doesn ' t matter anymore
what do you think geu rae ?
about what ?
your view on marriage
i ' m just a temp
thanks for the good news

how i ran away to my first workplace then the army ?
how i ' m a 2-year contract worker ?
holidays can be
ruthless time your family can hurt each other
i felt bad about leaving
my mom alone
but i think it ' ll be better i stay away
but
there ' s nowhere to go
how did i live such a pitiful life ?
i realized i didn ' t even have a friend to
enjoy a cup of coffee a movie nor a riverside walk with
where should i put this ?
here
take this first
is there anything i can help with ?
you ' re geu rae in sales team 3 right ?
yes
why ' d you come on a holiday ?
don ' t overwork yourself when you ' re a temp
they won ' t make you a full-timer
dang  " temp "
there ' s
nowhere for me to go today
i think i was wrong
i wasn ' t thinking
i shouldn ' t have left my mom alone
my geu rae showed promise ever since he played go
he ? please
don ' t make excuses for me
i knew he ' d make it big long ago
he always comes late since
they need him all the time
this higher-up came to visit
him when he was working late !
so many people would visit him when he played go
people would come left and right gosh !
you know how good he looks in suits ?
he even looked great
in his dad ' s old suit that doesn ' t even fit
he looked like he was born
to work at a company
and is it just a normal company ?
it ' s one of the top 5 trading companies !
sis-in-law ok
you ' re so proud when he ' s a temp
imagine when he ' s a full-timer
hey you think temps are for everyone ?
my geu rae suffers so much ?
sis-in-law don ' t cry
i only smiled as i didn ' t want to
discourage him after he failed in go
now he ' s smiling at us
when he ' s suffering inside !
that ' s how geu rae is like !
ok have a drink
let ' s not forget it
i ' m my mom ' s pride
i ' m not a disappointing son
hello
hello
you had an eye for people
mr oh

geu rae
i ' m going to get coffee you want a cup ?
i ' ll make mine
ok
you better start the new business
yes we ' re working hard
is he on it again ?
jang geu rae ?
sit down
it ' s interesting
interesting indeed
he ' s just focused on work without
any concerns or calculations
like a daredevil
like you-know-who
actually he reminds me of you mr oh
it ' s fun when you decide on an item and learn the business
you remember then ?
when we were the first to secure germanium in the east sea
we were running about looking for refinery facilities
we worked on many cases without insurance
after we heard that company couldn ' t go manufacturing
they wanted full compensation
so a few were fired to take responsibility
we got through that too
you know mr oh
i mean sang sik
sometimes
i wonder why you
grew distant from me
we were tight like comrades in war ?
the only person fired was lee eun ji
who ?
the one who died
i think she did something wrong
now i see why you ' re still like this in sales team 3
you fool
you bent over backwards
to protect temps then too
will you do that this time too with geu rae ?
i ' ll drink the tea next time
didn ' t you say
you ' d take responsibility then ?
didn ' t you ?
did you say you wouldn ' t take responsibility ?
i can ' t remember
if lee eun ji can ' t
will you take responsibility ?
will you take responsibility ?
take a deep breath
mr choi
couldn ' t remember eun ji
he ' s just acting like he can ' t
no he really can ' t
since she ' s not worth remembering
that ' s the way he works instinctively
he perfectly erased himself from that incident
so perfectly that he could fool himself
it ' s his instinct not intention
that ' s why he ' s a scary man
he used to tell eun ji every day
what you ' d see in self-help books
" go to night college "
" dream big "
" effort will pay off " " work hard and you ' ll see a road "
she was smart
she ' d be alive if i had known my place
she would ' ve worked comfortably
met a nice guy
got married
and lived happily right ?
since she ' s a good girl
she told me with smile
" thank you mr oh
i just have to continue working like this right ?  "
geu rae asked me the same thing
i ' ll become a full-timer like this right ?
i said he can ' t make it
mr oh
times are tougher than eun ji ' s
empty hope
and irresponsible consolation are useless
it ' s scarier we live in a world where irresponsible
consolation and empty hope can ' t be given
since there are so many who are
desperate for that empty hope at least
still
he won ' t make it
i can ' t even drink water in front of you
do it over
mr oh ' s treating geu rae differently this year
one of us were sacrificed for him
what a tough life
if you have time to think about others work on your weak points
if i get a step closer i ' m two steps further the next day
geu rae $100 ? probably ?
tell him to take baek ki
you said you ' d sell anything
i told him he can ' t make it
empty hope
and irresponsible consolation are useless
there are so many who are
desperate for that empty hope at least
still ?  he can ' t make it
a road with a dead end
it ' s not that
i just want to continue working
with everyone i ' ve worked with
us
together
always
there ' s still a whole year left
that we can walk together
hello !
hello !
you scared me
what ' s with you ?
i ' ll start working !
you look so energized these days geu rae
brew some coffee from the 15th floor
or you could get them from a caf ?
suk yool
keep your chin up
i told you to wait
that ' s all we can do
i ' ve been there
sang hyun if we just wait ?
baek ki how are you ?
good long time no see
let ' s have a drink if you ' re not busy today
i ' ll be nearby
uh call me later bye
if we just wait ? give me the files
i ' ll take a look before i go
oh here
baek ki
" shall "  would be better than  " must "  here
it adds a polite nuance to the sense of obligation
but i thought we needed a stronger  " must "
alright then
you have a hard life too
if we just wait ? there ' s trouble sir
there ' s a hole in the ship
what ?
i don ' t think it ' s that bad
yes
we ' ll find out and call you back bye
what happened ?
let ' s have a meeting in 20 minutes yes
come with me yes sir
i don ' t know the details of the urgent call but it won ' t sink
where did it happen ? near vietnam
call the company and you ask for updates in real time
check my meeting schedule yes
and baek ki call the buyers
never mind i ' ll do it just book a meeting room yes sir
this is jang baek ki at one international
there ' s a problem with our ship
yes
yes can you check for any similar cases ?
thank you bye
right around here
these are the list of companies
we could contact for worst case scenarios ok
we can ' t send another ship there ?
it ' s impossible due to the product ' s cost
what about using a crane ?
vietnam ' s sea makes conditions tough
so let ' s not think about that
what about a tugboat ?
you think tugboats just fall from the sky ?
everything will sink by the time we send them !
what ' s going on ?
steel is in trouble
there ' s a hole in the ship they sent to aquaba
what ' s going on ?
hello hi
there ' s a hole in the ship ?
yes
mr kim
there was ship trouble last year with sales how was it taken care of it ?
they didn ' t depart long ago so the products were loaded on a different ship
yeah ?
gosh this is bad
let ' s go
can ' t you fill in the hole ?
geu rae
are you kidding ? yes
you can fill it in
why take him so seriously ?
no i think it ' s good advice
yeah ?
let ' s go come on
you could be blamed
sir
ok
what about filling in the hole ?
what ? is that possible ?
if it ' s just a small crack it ' ll be possible
well ?
let ' s send divers and check if it ' s a crack
we can have welders stand by at nearby ports
ok let ' s do it yes
call a nearby branch and ask them to get welders
yes
kang hae joon speaking
sir this is jang baek ki at one international
we ' ll need welders and divers for ?
geu rae
yes
did you finish the weekly report ? yes
yes
did you check the mongolia contract ?
yes
the japan rice wine b/l draft ?
the rice wine b/l draft
why are you working so hard when you finished everything ?
you told us to get the next business item ready
i ' m working on one too
you ' ll do it alone ? yes
you ' ve never done an item alone
then maybe i shouldn ' t ?
no go ahead
yes thank you
mr yoo
i ' ve uploaded the norway mineral case in the shared folder
ok print out a copy for me too
yes sir
i ' ll call you back soon
what ?
what can we do ?
i couldn ' t dissuade your dad again
young yi
what do you mean what we should do ?
i ' m sorry
what does dad ' s business and taking the
early rent deposit have to do with me ?
mom
i ' m barely sane now
you know how i ' ve lived for the past
half-year after he borrowed money
you told me to live my life
the landlord said we can pay monthly
i just ask you for the security deposit
i can ? mom !
we don ' t have anywhere to go now
i don ' t have money
i barely paid off the debt
i can barely breathe now !
it ' s barely over now !
i can ' t do it
mr oh
did you want something from me ?
nope
oh ok
steel team
hello
i heard there was trouble are things ok ?
yes thanks to geu rae
what did he do ?
fortunately it ' s a small crack and we can fill it in as he said
so we ' re resolving the issue now
that ' s not thanks to geu rae but all the workers
he just happened to think of an idea
so that means he ' s really competent
some people know how to resolve issues like him
come on that ' s ridiculous
see you later see you later sir
one international jang baek ?
yes sir
i ' m glad to hear that
we will receive a call as soon as the ship is repaired
that ' s the status and additional costs thank you
mr han said the first filling is complete
and the divers are on stand by as you asked for
i think if there ' s another crack we can repeat welding with it anchored
i ' ll secure an area just in case
ok
that was so stressful
what would we have done without geu rae ?
geez
hello
hi geu rae
mr song asked me to give this to you thanks
thanks for before what ?
welding
i crossed my line
i ' m sorry
keep up the good work
pardon ?
some people know how to resolve issues like him
keep up the good work
is this yours ?
if you
have time to worry about others
you should work on your own flaws
you shouldn ' t butt in others '  business too much
okay
thank you for the advice
if you
have time to worry about others
you should work on your own flaws
please baek ki
alright
i ' ll ask auditing for you
thank you
i don ' t deserve that
look !
gone insane now ?
oh new item you ' re clearly something else ?
gosh
you shouldn ' t look at others '  stuff like that
i should go to the field
what ?
why ?
here
i mean at this company there ' s nothing i can change
changing your boss ' s irrationality isn ' t accepted either
you need to wait to fight with a stronger opponent ?
until when ?
i ' m most scared
about waiting until i become a jerk like him
i ' m sure he wasn ? t like that in the beginning
if you ' re not insane why are you smiling by yourself ?
there ' s a distance you can ' t do anything about no matter what you do
baek ki ?
if you get a step closer you ' re
two steps further the next day
he ' s always like that
right
what ? that geu rae ?
he was a disaster
life is so unfair
he got in passed tests and fired people
he didn ? t like all through connections
he got an item through connections too ?
that ' s not really true sang hyun
my gosh ?
slow down
people like me is disadvantaged because of ditchers like him !
why do you think i failed ?
ok let ' s say it might not have been me
still
one of us were sacrificed for his spot
he did a good job with the presentation
yeah right
stammering and selling those absurd dirty slippers ?
gosh he made it with that
it all proves how strong his connections are
i can say suk yool is competent but not that jerk
you should be honest too
you think geu rae is one of us ?
i hope you don ' t
he ' s not in our league
" fair opportunity "  my foot
how can we share fair opportunities with him ?
my mom spent so much on tutors and cram schools !
she worked so hard !
this is reverse discrimination
i should ' ve enjoyed my life too
i never slept before midnight all throughout school
elementary school ?
i went to so many cram schools and in college ?  !
i studied abroad too
but
what ' s this ?
huh ?
how ' s your company ?
it ' s just temporary
i ' ll go to a conglomerate
baek ki
you know what ?
in order to keep our position
we need to work for a conglomerate
so how ' s geu rae doing now ?
this proposal has to be as professional as possible
i created a proposal according to the company ' s manual
with professional terms suiting
the business direction and the reasonable vision
well i don ' t know
i ' m not sure but it feels different this time
mr oh said only my conviction
is important in persuading others
i have conviction this time
geu rae
you must be confident
no sir
you worked hard past office hours
i ' m sure you did well
well
i just did my best
your best only works in school
at work only the results count
geu rae has distinct ideas
he sure does
once in a while
what ' s up with him again ?
stop putting him up on a pedestal
i ' ll see you later
i ' ll see you later geu rae yes
let ' s see your distinct idea
though i don ' t have any expectations
as you see the contamination of famous tourist sites is
increasing each year
and the future of the world ' s automobile business is
also heading towards low-emission vehicles
we can expect environment conservation
acts in popular tourist sites including
the eiffel tower in paris grand canyon
in the us and australia ' s opera house
so the electric car rental and sales business which will
lead to growth for the next generation will clearly be lucrative
that ' s all for my presentation
you ' re not really smart at all
what ?
you said you ' d bring up a business item
what ' s with all this ?
you don ? t even know these terms
why ' d you use english when you ' re not good at it ?
what are you trying to sell ?
to whom ?
i have no idea what you ' re saying
but it doesn ' t sound like an amateur
talk doesn ' t come first
if you
have time to worry about others
you should work on your own flaws
young yi
did you give me the printouts ?
did you ?
young yi !
printouts
what printouts ?
the norway case !
yes i ' ll request it
what ?
you said you requested it and it came yesterday
what ?
when did i say that ?
what ' s wrong with you ?
oh the norway case sorry
gosh look at that mess
print it out for him first
yes
she ' s going out to print it out ?
to the copier
why ' d she become geu rae all of a sudden ?
you wanted printouts right ?
yeah
young yi
is something wrong ?
no
it seems something ' s wrong
no everything ' s fine
geu rae must ' ve really wanted to do well
he overdid it didn ' t he ?
shall we just end it like that ?
shouldn ' t we tell him what ' s wrong ?
tell him what ?
you ' ve been treating geu rae differently this year
how so ?
no way
he ' s a good employee
it ' s a shame
it ' ll be hard won ' t it ?
him working full-time ?
it ' ll be hard
then he ' ll have to start preparing
there will be a position for him where
he can use what he learned here
the landlord said we can pay monthly
i just ask you for the security deposit
i can ?
we don ' t have anywhere to go now
no way
i won ' t do it this time
yes sir
yes
young yi
read the third point in the norway contract
yes
now
yes
please wait a minute
the number ?
what are you doing ? yes
hurry up
why ' s it taking all day ?
what are you doing ?
sorry i can ' t remember it
sorry i can ' t remember it
why you guys ?
what are you doing ?
give it to me !
i ' m so sorry
dang !
it ' ll be hard won ' t it ?
him working full-time ?
it ' ll be hard
then he ' ll have to start preparing
there will be a position for him where
he can use what he learned here
all throughout my life !
you know how i ' ve lived because of you dad
how ?
how could you ask for money again ?
what did i do wrong to you ?
i said i ' m sorry
i ' d be so grateful for the
money during these hard times
this is really the last time
i always wanted a son but have i ever treated you badly ?
daughters are children too
dad !
come on help me out one last time
don ' t ever call me again
young yi i was just ?
i wonder what ' s wrong with her today
it ' s strange
maybe something bad has happened
why worry about her ?
i don ? t want to but ?
you can ' t help it since we work together every day
young yi
what ' s wrong ?
nothing sir
young yi is something wrong at home ?
you ' ve been ? no
don ? t worry
take care of your personal affairs before you come to work !
don ' t make a mess at work so we don ' t have to work !
come on
geez
don ' t you think you went too much ?
actually we can ' t even care for her
she built a thick wall around herself
get away i don ' t want to talk about it
geez
you can ' t climb stairs without a foundation
you can ' t ultimately climb stairs with
success where there ' s no foundation
you end up on the ground again
shouldn ' t we tell him what ' s wrong ?
geu rae
yes ?
it ' s $100
go sell anything out there
you want a cool business right ?
business ?
don ' t be fancy it ' s just selling stuff
making a profit after buying it cheap
buying good items and selling it to people who need it
go find out the basics of selling stuff
exclude your family
by 7:00pm
what a long title
how did he do to get rejected ?
he deserved it
hello ?
how are you ?
i checked the email
but the price won ' t work so i ' ll tell mr oh
but i think it ' ll be tough
i ' ll let you know after checking
for environment conservation of popular tourist sites by jang geu rae]
bye
what ' s with me ?
you want to smell my new cologne ?
it ' s no fun ok
baek ki
you shouldn ' t look at that
i ' m sorry
i just happened to ?
it ' s not confidential
geu rae just got in trouble for it so it ' s embarrassing
but
it ' s not that bad
why ?  ?
you tell him since you ' ve read it
what ?
yeah tell me your opinion
yes
i think ?
? for rental businesses specific site
selection methods should be given
automobile inventory handling and
depreciation strategies aren ' t either
and
the part on profits is quite abstract
since simulation should be redone
this proposal has to be rewritten
$100 for geu rae ?
probably
tell him to take baek ki too
what ?
why should i ?  ?
where shall we go ?
baek ki
shouldn ' t we decide what to buy first ?
then what should we buy ?
how should i know ?
anyway let ' s go where we can buy items
yes where ?
that ' s what we ' re trying to decide
you buy anything you want
it ' s your homework not mine
i ' ll sell anything for you ?
come to that caf ? over there
hello
how are you ?
hi baek ki it ' s been a while
how ' s work ?
good
how ' s your business going ?
come on leasing service is no business
it ' s nothing fancy
i just took over from my family
we should go for a drink
yes
so can i visit you today ?
why ask ?
you ' re welcome to come anytime
yes
see you later
i wonder how geu rae ' s doing now
i hope he learns something
as he gets in trouble out there
he ' ll learn why his report failed
i wonder what he ' ll sell
i had a hard time deciding what to sell with this mission too
i went to this store and that like crazy
$10 it ' s practically free !
so i thought i ' d buy something
cheap that everyone will use
buying something cheap and selling a lot of them
yeah that ' s the trap
that ' s cheap
you ' d think buying something cheap
and selling a lot of them would work
that ' s the trap of this mission
choose a nice one
sir do these socks sell well ?
of course they ' re less than half-price of what you buy at markets
and you can see how durable it is
look
8 pairs of socks or
5 underwear for $10 !
sir i ' ll get $100 worth
$100 ? yes
just socks ?
just underwear ?
half half please
hi mr kim geu rae
how ' s it going ?
i ' ve just started
break the record for highest profit
buy it cheap and earn big money
yes
then will we be able to party with that profit ?
yes
good luck
he keeps saying  " yes "
i hope he didn ' t buy those cheap cart socks
the full package with underwear
i can ' t even drink water in front of you
so scary
did you reflect yourself well ?
will you drop it guys ?
all the newbies attack their bosses like this at first
i ' ll train him well
do a good job please

since i don ' t need it
baek ki

you told me to buy anything
we ' ll be able to sell it where there are many people
baek ki

i ' ll give you one more only you i don ' t need it
just you i don ' t need it

i guess you ' ll have to work hard at least
keep working hard
please wait here
where will you go ?
i ' ll sell it
where ? stay here
geu ?
having a memory is wonderful
but they say forgetting is truly wonderful
what you can forget
is no longer a wound
i came in
as with all games
you realize you ' re not ready
the moment you start to play
strong resolutions and shouts before that
are intuition signs of anxiety
when you want to run away
it means it ' s too late
or you ? ve already started playing
captain
geu rae
how are you ?
good
where is he ?
go ?
why ' d he come here ?
does he know anyone here ?
go ?
i couldn ' t do it right then
did you see ? geu rae ' s here
-really ? really ?
yeah
he must got a job somewhere
he ' s wearing a suit
geu rae ?
i never thought he ' d set foot here again
but he ' s here ?
yeah
i heard you work for a trading company
sungwon ' s ceo helped me out
yeah
he really liked you
how ' s work ?
good that ' s great
but what brings you here ?
uh ?
my boss gave me a mission
mission ?
yes i have to sell these
i was wondering if i could sell them here
according to the rule of games
everything goes forward
they ' re underwear and socks
even if hell is at the end
geu rae
yes
you shouldn ' t have come here
because
everyone here will buy it for you
out of sympathy or encouragement
then you couldn ' t say you pulled the mission off
exclude your family
your boss won ' t want
you to do this either
right
geu rae was so good it ' s a shame
we thought he ' d be the first to become a pro
he ' s much better than pro kim
it ' s a shame
he started at seven right ?
that ' s too late to become a pro
but he became a student in a year
he beat lee se chang in grade school and
he always excelled in competitions especially
he was a good student too
when he quit high school i saw the
teacher come and dissuade our master
he could ' ve made it if it weren ' t for his financial situation
i heard he even had part-time jobs at dawn too
it seemed he came to ask a favor
he must not have wanted to come
how could you after giving up on go ?
-it must be hurt it must be hurt
sir
i ' ll get going
bye
geu rae
yes
what is it ?
you couldn ' t sell a single pair ?
i ' m sorry
if we go in it ' ll be past 7pm
yes
let ' s go
suk yool

i thought you were getting along
but you ' re an outcast again ?

mistake ?
what mistake did you make ?
it ' s all their fault
it ' s always their fault
i was flustered earlier
earlier ?
earlier when ?
everything becomes a mess
when it involves my dad
aren ' t you going home ?
this kid has to come home first
it ' s almost 7pm

i worked so hard

work is war ?
outside is hell
can you help out geu rae ?
come to my office sometime
to play go
suk yool
extremes can relate to each other
geu rae
you ' re early
in order to withstand helplessness
in order to withstand injustice and phoniness
suk yool chose to keep his mouth shut
he was erasing time
by training how to numb himself
he lost his smile
and we lost him
i started to miss his annoying chatter long ago
but none of us could dare to give him advice
it ' s been 17 months since we started working
we knew clearly by now
you had to withstand hardships by yourself
but i still wanted to tell him
" even if you lose a stone
" the game goes on
suk yool "
october is already over get ready to hibernate -ms ha
yes be careful not to catch colds
it ' s become cold
you ' re early
hi geu rae
hello hello
hello
hello hello
hello hello
day to succeed for a change isn ' t it ?
what was the first item ?
tourist site ?
environmental conservation ?
you got in trouble for that random report
you ' ve sold socks and underwear
what was next ?
rice ? that was random too right ?
i don ' t know what you ' re trying to sell
rice or processed rice goods ?
brown rice or health supplements ?
you ' ll make it today
mr oh didn ' t say anything
hello mr oh
mr oh today is the day of destiny for geu rae ' s proposal
yeah ?
it came ?
let ' s see
you made it you made it !
finance approved of the budget
why ' d they do that ?
congratulations geu rae
thank you
refreshing !
anyway good luck since you got the green light
yes
good luck !
yes sir !
treat us to coffee since you ' re in charge of a proposal for the first time
yes i want americano
what would you like mr chun ?
latte ? latte
it ' s sold out
just buy four cups of anything
yes
it hasn ? t been approved yet ?
don ' t worry it ' ll pass
i thought they ' d approve it yesterday but it ' s late
i ' m sure they ' re still on the budget
since finance is fussy about a few categories
i see
check if the steel frame order has arrived
ok
baek ki
steel frame order
yes ?
ms sun
hi young yi
you must ' ve been to the sauna
did you work late ?
i stood up all night because of a bidding
i forgot to take my makeup my face felt so tight
you need to apply stuff at this age
you still have great skin
yeah ?
i never have time to get skin care
it ' s still improved a lot
your loan interest is past due ms ahn young yi
please check since you might experience disadvantages
such as suspension of credit card
why are you sighing ?
i ' m fine
shall we go for some coffee ?
mr oh hi
staring at the rain ?
i heard the headquarters are reviewing your team ' s items
yes
i heard the group will expand their businesses from next year
did you submit your item ?
yes
all the newbies were told to submit it also
what if your proposal makes it ?
i doubt it
that would bring more worries
what ?
do you still eat sandwiches alone ?
what ?
no we eat together too
you know ?
there ' s no excuse to trip him anymore since you ' re not suffering like before
but it doesn ' t seem like you ' re tight either
it sounds like
you must be looking at young yi all day
of course i haven ' t given up on you yet
i ' ll do my best to bring
you to my team next time
it ' s my limit
i can ' t really relate to others personally
so seniors won ' t feel comfortable around me
it ' s because you ' re a perfectionist
right ?
guys could have fistfights over who was
right but make up easily at the sauna
but what can girls do ?
you never had such concerns right ?
my blood type is o
my blood type is o too
you know what ?
mr ma ' s blood type is o too
what ?
hanging in there ?
yes ?
gosh
is the meeting over ?
yeah
something happened ?
gosh
we ' re in trouble
the headquarters likes your item the best
what ?
that means trouble
what will we do ?
yes sir
what do the headquarters know ?
how could they ignore experience and evaluate with a few pieces of paper ?
it should be fair !
i thought of your idea too
but i didn ' t proceed with it
they think anything bold can become ideas items and businesses ?
have you ever done a business before ?
mr ma is rooting for resource team 3
he had been with them for a long time
he must ' ve wanted to support his team
the structure ' s looking good
let ' s check the costs with mr chun yes
mr chun look at geu rae ' s proposal
and there ' s a rumor that mr ma failed with hr by a small difference
so what would happen if headquarters took resource team 2 ' s side ?
he ' ll think he ' s a real failure
don ? t do it
tell them you won ' t do it
she worked overnight on it for a month ?
yes
give it over to team 3
then what should we tell headquar ?
hey !
we ' re the pros
persuade them that our proposal has more potential
yes
email the person in charge saying you can ' t do it
report to me directly after you do
answer me
what an arrogant one
but they ' re both ideas from teams under mr ma
he gives them approval too
geu rae
did you forget about the iran case ?
what ?
it ' s similar think about it
the team that backed him up failed
what would happen if a female newbie ' s idea is chosen ?
think of it as mr ma ' s long-term race
they put so much effort into people who back them up
office politics give you a headache right ?
avoiding isn ' t the answer
i checked it
ours always changes so check the forwarded content
thank you
life itself is politics not just work
you got to get used to it
that way you can survive
anyway mind your own business
focus on your first business -yes
bring in big profits and treat us to a big dinner
yes beef
beef ? sounds good right ?
yeah
regular spandex can ' t be dyed in the manufacturing process
but one international factory ' s
spandex is dyed in acid dyes
yes i ' ll send you the sample
i ' ll sort out the rest and email it to you
yes thank you
suk yool coffee
mr sung does me proud
the us market isn ' t easy
10000000 yards of sofa fabric
the bosses showered me with compliments
the factory is running fine right ?
of course they said they can meet the deadline
but
i ' m worried
it ' ll be tough with only our factory
don ? t worry
subcontractors would decrease our profits
it ' s not like we can ' t do it
nice nice
what would we do without you ?
hello
you seem to be going through puberty
you ' re so quiet now
oh
are you already in that phase at work ?
that ' s early
that usually comes after two years
sir
i don ' t think our own factory can do it without subcontractors
even if they go all-in there are other team ' s work too
i don ' t think it ' ll be possible
mr sung said he talked it over with the factory
they said it ' s possible too
don ? t worry
i ' m sure mr sung knows what he ' s doing
hot !
the data ?
what are you doing ?
what ?
that ' s from kotra
yes
it says in kazakhstan
they greet you and say their names even if you ' re a stranger
in kazakhstan ? yes
what else ?
when you shake hands you take a strong grip
a strong grip ? what else ?
you hug people you ' re close with
hug ?
what if you love them ?
it should be on the next page next page ?
but why are your ears red already ?
you want a double sniff of my cologne ?
oh ?
what does it say next ?
sales team 3 ?
yes sir
change the person in charge ?
yes
they said geu rae won ' t do
resubmit it by mr chun and mr kim
what ' s the reason ?
he ' s a contract employee with less than a year to go
it ' s not a long-term business
it ' s a two month case and geu rae can pull it off with responsibility
he ' s prepared thoroughly and no one can do ?
mr oh
you really thought so ?
you thought geu rae could take full responsibility ?
no one thinks so here
including the company rules
i ' ll
meet with the chief of planning
chief of planning ?
why do you keep causing trouble ?
he ' s just a contract employee
just resubmit it by the others
there have never been any contract employees in sales
so there are no rules for that
no ?
right they ' re all full-timers
if there are no rules couldn ' t we make a precedent ?
precedent ?
no
the plan is to make a rule that it won ' t be allowed
that will prevent these issues
issues ?
sir this is unfair
geu rae ? mr oh
an infrastructure is built for the companies and buyers for a new business
the company ' s conclusion is
geu rae a temp can ' t handle that
related businesses are created
even after the business ends
it ? s the company ' s loss if the person in charge changes midway
so it ' s absurd to exclude the person who created the new business to
make the new infrastructure ?
geez
i ' m not getting through to you
i ' ll make it simple
why would the company invest in someone who ' ll leave ?
geu rae ' s been on that proposal for a while
it ' s all useless if you ' re going to ignore it !
mr oh you shouldn ' t get emotional over this
why would the company invest in someone who ' ll leave ?
i think it ' s ok
ask mr chun yes sir
what ? yes
ok
how ' s this ?
the conditions aren ' t bad but ?
yes
let ' s go with insun
shinsung is good but they have
little experience and know-how
but their conditions are the best
contact them yes
and have a meeting first ?
yes thank you
sure
mr oh
mr oh that ' s not fair
it is what it is
that ' s absurd !
you know how geu rae didn ' t even get enough sleep for two months
but we take that ?
submit it with my name ?
no way ! i can ' t do that !
there ' s really any other way ?
you saw how excited he was about it
he ' s about to memorize all the kazakhstan street names
he ' s about to get married to a bride there
how could they treat geu rae like this ?
since it ' s a company
they can do that since it ' s a company
but he worked so hard till now !
don ' t act like he saved the country or something
he just worked for his salary
so will you really do that ?
tell them you won ' t do it
give it over to team 3
email the person in charge saying you can ' t do it
just do as mr ma says
that will give you the least trouble
this is no competition no matter how hard you try
there ' s no chance of winning
i ' m not saying just always back down
you should know when to fight and when to back down
i ' m not saying this out of worry for you
i just don ' t want further trouble and mr ma going insane
what threat was that ?
nothing
you think
bosses know everything ?
they don ' t know diddly
they can ' t make the deadline
wait and see
the site won ' t sit and watch
da in
hello this is jang baek ki from steel team
when do finance ' s results regarding
our indonesia case come in ?
regarding the pipes
yes sir
and our team ' s additional proposal h-beam case ?
no no
it ' s not urgent
you ' re still reviewing it ?
baek ki
yes sir
yes
the youngjin report is not finished yet ?
i just have to print it out
that and
print out east europe exports data for
the last two weeks from the kotra database
yes sir
mr kim
it can be provided 20% cheaper than japan
but it ' s 20% more expensive than malaysia
how should i persuade the buyer ?
this ? yes
even though it ' s cheap it won ' t withstand heat
there were lots of complaints when there were cracks right ?
yes
didn ' t you choose them since few products withstand 80 degrees ?
yes but
it ' s a new company
mr oh
you should go with the good conditions
they ' ll build know-how with time
yes
sales team 3 jang geu rae speaking
hello i see
i ' ll be right down
they brought documents
i ' ll go get them ok
he just wants to run with others
and they want us to break his legs ?
mr chun
don ' t mess with these items
i know there was a similar business
but the conditions and profits are better ?
mr chun
you can ' t work on those items
you shouldn ? t work on them
what do you mean ?
those items were only done by the elite employees from open recruitment
you know what i mean ?
you weren ' t even chosen by open recruitment
thought you had learned experience
comes second when working for sales team 3
why don ' t you get it ?
what will you do ?
geu rae will be so disappointed
no way
it ' s not the end of the world just because the person in charge changed
but it looks like the end of the world for you mr oh
me ?
no way
i know
you can ' t do anything this time
this is different from dong sik ' s case
i can ' t tell you to go to mr choi this time
just comfort him
uh are you from shinsung ?
are you in sales team 3 ?
yes
i ' m han sung jin from shinsung
yes here
i didn ' t bring my card
it ' s ok
thanks
we ' re behind in our career but we really work hard
the whole company has high hopes for this
i see
if you give it to us you won ' t be disappointed
we ' ll take a good look
thank you
sure i appreciate it
thank you
go ahead go ahead
no you go ahead first
okay bye

you said you played go right ?
yes
ok
come on up someday
to play go
i received the additional documents sir
their executive director came himself
ok
he really wanted it to work out
ok
the whole company has high hopes for this
he was sweating in this weather
i felt sorry for him
geu rae yes
who are you feeling sorry for ?
what ?
you can ' t be feeling sorry for him in front of a head of a family
i ' m sorry
just focus on the papers
yes
before too
the person in charge should know what to do
you prepared so much and kept asking others
that won ' t do !
i ' m sorry
go get the fax and scan it for turkey baek ki
it ' s urgent
typos
maybe that ' s why it was disapproved
baek ki yes ?
the fax
where shall i send it ?
the company ' s not paying you to do your business only
what ?
is the meeting report complete ?
not yet
how can you do any project like that ?
i know you care about your first business
but i can ' t let you do that ignoring your current work you know why ?
that ' s when you make mistakes you know
you haven ' t given me the kotra data ?
i ' m sorry
go get the fax and scan it for turkey
also find the china samples in the storage
yes sir
are you sleeping ?
what ?
i thought you were sleeping with your eyes open
no
uh i heard you submitted a new item
did they approve ?
not yet
i heard the headquarters liked yours
is something wrong ?
no
see you later
and geu rae ?
never mind
bye
as i sweated like a dog
the miserable two hours went by
my body was shaking terribly till
i returned to the waiting room to get dressed
life is not easy for anyone
this is ahn young yi in resource team 2
due to personal reasons i won ' t be able to ?
? continue with the business item
thank you for the interest
i request you to replace it with another business
hi mr kim
how have you been ?
in front of the company ?
business proposal season right ?
you must be swamped
yes i ' m waiting for approvals
how ' s your business ?
same old ?
isn ' t it tough since it ' s not a franchise ?
you know ?
what ?
is something wrong ?
it was fine
i was confident about pizza
when i was a resident employee
and since i ate so much on business trips
it wasn ' t a name brand
but rumors spread
it was introduced on the internet too
but business hasn ' t been good ?
we closed it after a market opened
i used the funds i received when i left work
and also got a big loan
i thought i ' d start a new life
mr kim mr chun
yes
mr oh hasn ? t taken care of it yet ?
why hasn ' t he submitted it ?
excuse me ?
geu rae ' s kazakhstan case
i told him to change the person in charge
uh ?
mr oh didn ' t tell you ?
why won ' t he listen to me ?
i made sure he ' d understand
he checked with planning too what ' s he doing ?
sir ?
one of you two take it
why are you acting so foolish ?
i know you care about him
he ' s a temp it ' s not realistic
what does a person in charge do ?
he takes responsibility until the end
when mr oh comes in tell him to submit it
bye
bye
hello
geu rae
this is insane
sorry there ' s no room
ok go ahead
maybe i should ' ve hung in there then
go along with the politics
maybe i should ' ve
at least acted like i was lining up with the authorities
i can ' t sleep
out of regret
i ' d go on 3-4 overseas
business trips a month
the kids wanted gifts thinking i went sightseeing
but then
i thought i was doing a great job as a trading man
but it ' s all useless
my wife is sacrificing so much
i can ' t watch my kids grow up
hey
remember that time ?
back then our business partner was something else
i kept going to their embassy every day and asked for so much info
it was when you were new
we still talk about you over drinks
right
so much ambition
we ' d grab them by the collar
" give us the data "
" i need to make a living too "
it was like war
i gave him a good shake
he became so obedient
trading men aren ' t ambitious like that these days
you can ' t afford it now
the company is like a battlefield you said ?
don ' t quit until you ' re kicked out
outside ?
it ' s hell
i ' ll have to go out to the battle
yeah ?
then i ' ll
go back to hell
don ' t see me off it ' s ok
don ' t see me off
we ended up drinking
you should go back
go on ok
i should ' ve brought you a gift
buy your kids a snack or something
i ' m sorry about coming empty-handed
what is this ?
just accept it
take it bye !
bye
bye !
buy your kids a snack or something
i need to work again
i want to find the line i left behind
the overseas companies will still remember me
i left and i was so mad back then
but i need to work again
i have no choice
help me out
mr oh
yeah
what ?
uh geu rae found out as
he overheard us speaking
so ?
he won ' t answer his calls
the companies are calling us too
it ' s ok it ' s not like the country failed
he ' ll come back
do your work
yes
one international kim dong sik speaking
jang geu rae ?
he ' s not at his desk right now
okay
what are you doing here ?
mr oh
the companies are calling the person in charge
you ' re not answering them
we can ' t back you up !
we ' re not a call center !
come down
i ' ll go to the trade insurance corp
ok
mr chun
yes sir
how ' s your team these days ?
everything ok ?
i ' m sorry ?
geez
mr oh has a condition
a mental condition
he keeps at it though he knows the results
age doesn ' t change him
it ' s useless
but i like that about him sometimes
sir
can you possibly help geu rae out ?
i ' m sorry
why are you dragging for half a day ?
wouldn ' t she need time to calm down ?
she worked on it for a long time
you
were you always this emotional ?
don ? t act so soft just because she ' s the first girl
hey mr jung
yes
don ' t you want to get promoted ?
wow
what a gloomy day
young yi
yes
can ' t you give up ?
then let ' s say i ' m asking you a favor on this
excuse me ?
i have a promotion review
let ' s support
mr ma
but none of us could dare
to give each other advice
it ' s been 17 months since we started working
we know clearly by now
you have to withstand hardships by yourself
you were right
my item ?
my item
actually won ' t work out
you really think so ?
yes
i hadn ' t thought it out
i already emailed the headquarters
what ?
the factory is boycotting ?
what ?
-they ' re coming ? -where is he ?
i told you we can ' t work !
mister
we made it clear we can ' t do it
it ' s just an impossible mission !
other teams have orders too !
we ' ve only been getting
3-4 hours of sleep a day !
you want us to work the old machines ?
the manager clearly promised me
to make the deadline !
we know you forced us to do it
you said we had no choice !
the manager promised me
so you can go argue with him !
hey listen !
old machines are still machines
he said they work too !
you guys are so ignorant
what ? what ?
ignorant ?
if you don ? t go back to work today
it ' ll all be your faults
when sales makes an order
the factory should just do it !
and it ' s been promised !
if you have the time and energy to do this
you should go back and start working !
gosh let ' s go
we were crazy to think we could get through to them
fine !
do whatever you want !
we ' ll go on strike starting tomorrow !
let ' s go ! uh
this is ridiculous
how can you treat me like this ?
you guys are all responsible for the loss with the subcontractors !
mr sung !
suk yool do something what ?
you worked as an intern in ulsan right ?
we can ' t get our work done like that
persuade them so they don ? t go on strike
what can i do ?
you must be able to talk to them
you said you know people at the site
what can he do ?
just leave it
i ' ll make sure they take
responsibility if anything happens
yes sir
i ' ll take care of it
suk yool !
ok go do whatever possible
yes
*ahjusshi !
ahjusshi !
ahjusshi
you can leave like this
let ' s talk comfortably over a meal
what ?  meal ?
we can ' t eat in this situation !
ahjusshi
if you leave like this
if you go on strike
it ' s your loss too
loss ?
you always valued the site but now you ' re one of them
now that you sit in the office you
can just make orders to the factory ?
you can ' t make things happen just by forcing us !
don ' t you have a dad and a family ?
come on
can you work with an old machine ?
ahjusshi excuse me boss
there must be a misunderstanding
misunderstanding ?
my whole family relies on me
how would kids like you working
comfortably in the office understand that ?
i ' m suk yool i went to the site last time
i was born for the site
ok then you go to the site !
let ' s go
suk yool are you ok ?
mr oh yeah

thanks
mr oh
yeah
please switch the kazakhstan case ' s ?
? person in charge

i ' m sure i asked for euros
yes i ' ll revise it now
baek ki yes
congratulations

good job
thank you
i ' m sorry
i mean thank you
i guess the person in charge was switched for geu rae ' s case
i ' ll see you tomorrow
oh sure
bye young yi
for generations my family
well most of my relatives are blue-collar workers
we know the value of labor and integrity of sweat
we have pride in the site
hello ?
ahjusshi ?
ahjusshi
you ' re still here
did it hurt a lot ?
i ' m ok
you saw the man with the glove on ?
he ' s my older brother
he worked the machines with me two years ago
he lost two of his fingers
in the existing machine
it causes an accident every year
after the accident he went to the team for faulty goods
can you work with an old machine ?
my whole family relies on me
how would kids like you working
comfortably in the office understand that ?
suk yool
it ' s not like we ' re trying not to work
i just want to protect my hand
my family depends on it
my son ' s tuition depends on it
if i ' m not well
my family can ' t survive
you said you have pride in blue-collar workers
you said that ' s your family ' s background
you should ' ve considered this
geu rae
yes
yes baek ki
i ?
am so embarrassed of my specifications
what ' s wrong with your specifications ?
i know
i found out today
it ' s ?
it ' s not your fault
nor mine
nor my specifications
nor your past ?
anyway
i found out it ' s not our fault
so ?
cheers !
let ' s drink
long time no see
is your husband home ?
he ' ll be probably drinking nearby
it ' s tough right ?
it ' s just that my husband can ' t accept the fact
hi
why ' d you come to my house ?
you could just call
don ' t do this
how will you face your kids ?
keep sober
if you ' re drunk you can ' t do anything when new opportunities come
it ' s dangerous to be drunk when you ' re successful
but it ' s dangerous to be drunk when things aren ' t going well
our team has a new employee
he reminds me of you
he works hard without procrastination
but he ' s different from you
he works hard but
it ' s natural and he ' s passionate
but still rational
the young guy ' s not drunk
i ' ll get going
ok
mr kim ?
he started a business after quitting
he just watched me get kicked out
he started with three employees
but he ' s struggling without an expert
go see him
was he fired too ?
you know what it ' s like
fire and getting fired
come on no hatred
there ' s no hatred
oh the guy you mentioned
who ' s not drunk
yes
make sure this doesn ? t happen to him
it ' s not up to us
i hope he succeeds
that guy
mr oh
are you home ?
yes
ok
geu rae
yes mr oh
don ' t be drunk
yes
bye
right
i ' m not drunk
you were right
but realistically we can ' t give it to a contract employee
then you go to the site !
let ' s go
i can ' t be drunk
even if i lose a stone
the game must go on
i couldn ? t do it
i ' ll hire a subcontractor
suk yool !
you were acting arrogant and what have you done ?
you couldn ' t send the employees back to the site !
you shouldn ' t disregard the site
we shouldn ' t give them work for the
old machines and just badger them
it wasn ' t possible to begin with
mr sung must ' ve known it was impossible too
what ?
hey
you better choose good subcontractors
if you can ' t find them by today
the factory can ' t ever meet the deadline !
mr sung !
do what you can to find subcontractors
if you can ' t
our performances will be bad and we ' ll have a huge debt
that would mean trouble
i ' ll find them
it would ' ve been better to use the old machines
sir this is han suk yool in fabric
please work as hard as you can without the old machines
we ' ll find subcontractors and fill in what we can
ok thanks
but it won ' t be easy to find subcontractors now
we ' ll do our best
thank you

you really don ' t understand or are you feigning ignorance ?

oh really ?  including that one too ?
okay i see
but i ' ll need to take this matter for our internal discussion and
we ' ll come back to you shortly is that okay with you ?
just a second
baek ki
bring the turkey budget
yes
i told you many times you can ' t be doing your work only
i ' m sorry
i ' m not good at multi-tasking
sorry i have a few more questions on the cost you ' re talking about
i ' ve printed it out
mm-hmm
even a simple printout from you looks professional
is that so ?
yeah it ' s neat and smart just perfect
now you see that ?
i like your jokes too young yi
yes i ' m studying them hard these days
yeah ?
are we allowed to act like this ?
i don ' t know
i selected the subcontractors mm-hmm
they ' ll manufacture what ulsan couldn ' t within two weeks
the contract is complete
they ' ve been on it for three days so far
sounds good
i feel relieved now
the ulsan factory also said they ' d work hard to minimize our losses
sounds good
you take charge of communicating with them from now on
yes good job
i ' ll go have a cup of coffee
sure sure
how about saturday friends ?
i ' m not interested
come on stewardesses i ' m saying
they ' re smart kind and hot
so we should go on group blind dates for work …
why should we go on group blind dates for work ?
what are blind dates ?
it ' s the only way to meet girls
the way to confirm your love for co-workers and an opportunity to exhale
we need to hibernate
are there any girls around us besides transvestites or handsome young yi ?
what ?
what about me ?
hello hello
hello
the arrival is tomorrow right ? what time ?
4:00 sir
oh gosh he should just give up if the company opposes
i need to finish the vietnam case and ms sun is too much
it ' s just too much i mean think about it
we ' ll start working late tomorrow
we ' ll have to be prepared
she went to pakistan on a business trip
she asked our team for help too
i guess sales team 1 isn ' t too excited
yeah and the company isn ' t really either
there was an earthquake in pakistan last month
the pakistan government requested for assistance
if we can lower the price and payment won ' t be immediate
but ms sun just accepted that
from a humanitarian standpoint
so much work no effective results and the team isn ' t backing her up
ms sun will suffer on her own
she seemed to be exhausted
but
why were you talking about me ?
better go
suk yool those files from fabric …
oh regarding those …
don ' t you know what i mean by
go do it since i chose this item ?
is this item from mr choi ?
yeah
it ' s a solar energy development business for china
mr choi worked on it for a whole year
if we make the contract it ' s $05 bil business
it won ' t be as hard as you think
since this will back it up
it ' s all set up so you just need to get the contract signed
what do you mean this will back it up ?
is this the first time doing business with china ?
are you talking about connections ?
solar energy development businesses are national projects in china
i thought nothing was decided with poshin
look
they ' ll get this business
mr choi ' s judgment is good enough to say that will work
think it over this week and let me know on monday
hi mr chun
mr choi ?
why ?
why ' s he giving us such a big item ?
take it
if we pull it off it ' ll be worth 2-3 years '  performance results
i don ' t feel good about it
it ' s not like us to use connections
didn ' t we do whatever we could ?
if we don ' t do this they ' ll say we ' re totally incompetent
also using connections is normal in china
so what ' s there to feel bad about ?
yeah ?
this isn ' t about good will
what ?
using connections is normal in china
but in many times it ' s not legal
we could get in trouble
and the bigger issue is the connections for this are strong
failure to obtain the order of the solar energy business despite the connections
could get our team who ' s in charge blamed
and poshin obtaining this solar energy
development business is out of our hands
everything is possible if only they get this business
should i treat this gum disease
or just leave it ?
but
i like that about mr oh at times
this isn ' t about good will
failure to obtain the order of the solar energy business despite the connections
could get our team who ' s in charge blamed
mr chun
hi
i ' m good
i don ' t know what ' s going on
what ' s with mr choi ?
how do you really think ?
you really don ' t like it ?
you want me to be honest ?
mm-hmm
to be honest
i want to do it
if it succeeds
our team will really become huge
we ' ll be able to move away from the bathroom
poshin has always been in the business
in china so it ' s likely they ' ll get it
it ' s also a big company
but
i don ' t know why mr choi …
it ' s important for him too
he could become vice president by its success
vice president ?
but backup is necessary too
to prepare for the 1% possibility of failure
i ' m sure he wants to use our
team as his bullet and shield
that ' s all the more reason mr oh won ' t do it
there ' s no reason to at all
mr choi ' s intentions are obvious
it ' s totally different from the jordan case
no need to stick to it
i guess
but i still want mr oh to do it
since it ' s much more likely it ' ll succeed as you said
if only we make it we ' ll …
are you done ?
what ?
you didn ' t go for the demonstration ?
the china electronics researchers are coming for product demonstration
i told you yesterday oh right geez …
did mr oh leave ?
yes he did
he looked miserable with worries as if it was the end of the world
but he made it there ?
he said he needs to go to see if there ' s anything to sell
he ' s coming now
the blabbermouth factory manager too
oh mr ko !
how are you ? good
take care sure
oh you ' re so good-looking
hi
oh my you keep getting prettier
hello
oh our ramen hair mr kim nice to see you
take the jade cushion back
it hurts my bottom
you don ' t know what you ' re talking about
you need to get over that the same thing happens with medicine
you ' re all talk
sir why didn ' t you send us the report after the claim was resolved ?
i asked you a few times
i ' ll tell them to send it right away
you really don ' t need anything ?
no
what about a jade mat … i don ' t need it
what about a jade pillow … i don ' t need it !
mr kim is so diligent
you work so hard
when will you get promoted ?
i ' ve only had this position for three years
then won ' t you be promoted next year ?
then mr ramen-hair will be manager kim
but
it took years for you two to get promoted too
drop it will you ?
oh not you mr ko
you can ' t just make it by putting in time
right mr oh ?
hello
who ' s this ?
i ' ve never seen him before
this is our new employee
he ' s the china factory manager mr seo jin sang
he sits there jang geu rae
hello i ' m jang geu rae
nice to meet you
i ' m seo jin sang
your team must ' ve really grown
with these visually outstanding new employees and all
how many new employees are there ?
excuse me ?

i had high hopes to be honest
mm-hmm
with mr park ' s incident and the jordan case and all
though i don ' t have to go
you should !
working abroad is the highlight for us
i think i should ' ve gone to congo when they told me to
after i rejected that
i haven ' t gotten any offers
i don ' t even hope for america or europe
that one refusal must ' ve made a bad impression
i ' m sure that ' s not why
i ' m sorry
what ?
no !
come on
what are you saying ?
i ' ll go get some air
can the san paolo items be delivered by the deadline ?

you know chungsol is always late on deliveries
so what do you want me to do ? we can ' t work with them
there are other companies
geez
i didn ' t want to get you in trouble
i think youngmin will be better
who do you think you are jerk ?
what do you know about that
company to say such crap ?
crap ?

i think working with a lazy
irresponsible company like chungsol is worse

mr hwang should treat you to drinks
he should
are you putting it off to get married first ?
yeah that ' ll be more stable
dong sik got screwed again
i don ' t think mr oh cares about
others when he ' s focused on work
if you work like a dog anyways isn ' t it better
to have the results that shows ?
he doesn ' t have a luck for a boss
he always looks for work
why that …
but their team gets along
is it a meetup to get along well ?
a boss who procures items with results is preferable
of course !
good for him and myself
you get promotions and incentives
people badmouth them but actually want such teams
sales team 3 ?
they keep asking for trouble
let ' s go
why listen to nonsense ? come on

dong sik is a sociopath too
what is the world coming to ?
what are you saying jerk ?
why ' d you ask me to come when i wasn ' t even there ?

our team is difficult

i really
don ' t agree with them
that ' s not it …
i ' m like that
i ' m here because i want to work like a dog
you know
i want it
but it ' s not the case with you
when i ' m working i forget about those around me
so … mr oh
i like working with you
that ' s it
and i ' ll take care of myself
i ' ll tell you if i want to change teams
ok you ' re right

ok

ms sun collapsed sir
an ambulance came near the airport what ?
what are you talking about ?
come in
hi
is she ok ?
she ' ll need an overall checkup
the main reason is a sleeping disorder due to stress from overworking
she ' ll need to be hospitalized for a few days
with overtime work and the business trip
it was too much
just think of it as an opportunity to take a break
it was too much
i feel upset and guilty
i was promoted
really ?
congratulations
but what ' s with your expression ?
actually we fought because of that
i told her to quit since i got promoted
she had a hard time
maybe i was too hard on her
so she ' ll quit ?
no
she didn ' t want to quit
it ' s a big part of her since
she ' s worked for 15 years
she said she needs to protect herself
to love her family
mr oh we ' ll get going now
ok i should go too
i need to pick up so mi
i ' ll call you next time
thank you for your time
sure get going
thank you visiting
mr oh dissuade ms sun
the pakistan export case won ' t get much
credit and the company doesn ' t like it
i can ' t understand why she insists on it
actually you two are similar
anyway we need her
tell her to get lots of rest without worrying
tell her so she understands since you ' re close
sure
get going
i ' ll stay a bit longer
you woke up
are you ok ?
you didn’t have to come
come on
you ' re getting up hold on
it ' s going down
keep still keep still
i ' m good
you scared me
you ' ll have to stay for a few days
mr um and mr cha came
they ' re telling you to get plenty of rest
they said don ' t worry about work
worry ?
you should delay the pakistan case for now
get rest
and work twice as hard when you ' re out
maybe i shouldn’t do it
i don ' t think i can do this one
if it can ' t be delayed mr um and mr cha can do it
or
is it because your husband told you to stop working ?
when i was thinking about quitting
because of what he said
i talked to mr lee
and he …
have you heard about ms sun ?
what ?
she told mr lee she ' d quit
it must ' ve been withdrawn
what ?
then what about our promotions ?
we ' ll have to wait longer
i don ' t want to go to sales team 3
i want to work under you for a long time
i thought of them as family and took
care of their personal needs too
they were only thinking of getting ahead
they thought of my resignation
as an opportunity
they both had high hopes
since i ' m sick and all i don ' t want to do it anymore
it ' s because they haven ' t worked under you for a year yet
mr oh who ' s working abroad always
complimented you as an old subordinate
it ' ll be different when he comes back
just wait
hi
did you have dinner ?
yes
i heard ms sun collapsed
due to stress from overworking

you suffered a lot before
yes
bye
and about geu rae …
i heard there was a switch in the person in charge
sorry it ' s the company rule
i tried my best but i couldn ' t help
no sir
the company is tough
he did so much for it
so you need to be strong
it ' s not good for the company either
if they keep changing contract workers
you need to keep teaching them
from the start
let ' s get together for dinner sometime
ok
mr um
yes
about the pakistan case you two will continue with it right ?
anything i can do to help ? what ?
sir
you heard us
you couldn ' t dissuade her ?
sir
we ' re dying here
i thought of them as family and took
care of their personal needs too
they were only thinking of getting ahead
they thought of my resignation
as an opportunity
they both had high hopes
how ' s ms sun doing ?
she ' s ok
we were worried
if you ' re done you can leave yes
i ' ll get going
see you on monday

and baek ki
mr oh is amazing
how could he do this ?
we ' re young and we ' re sacrificing
our weekend for another team ' s work
are we a guerrilla army or human weapons here ?
but
i kept thinking
if that happened to me later would you all
do what mr oh did for her ?
could you ?
i ' ll guess your reaction according to your character
geu rae
" shouldn’t we have cup ramen for late nights ?  "
" if you don’t like it i ' ll totally change it !  "
come on
" mr oh "
come on
baek ki
" i ' d like to help but i can ' t move "
" the basics are really important "
suk yool
young yi
" i ' ll drive a truck if i have to !  "
" but i ' ll be moving like a snail !  "
see ?
only i ' d look bad
since i won ' t go
does that make sense ?
talking so much made me thirsty
drink mine
i ' m ok
let ' s go wrap up
ok come after you finish that
ok smoke
see you later
baek ki
i ' m impressed
come on we didn ' t need geu rae !
alright
thanks for the two days
i ' ll visit ms sun at the hospital
shall we go too ?
no it ' ll get crowded
go home and rest
i ' ll treat you to drinks
good day thanks !
take care
good day
let ' s go
ok
oh no !
how can you forget something so important ?
did you forget something ?
should i get mr oh ?
all you care about is work
we have 5 hours 34 minutes till sunday
let ' s spend the next 5 hours like it ' s 15 hours !
let ' s go this way since mr oh ' s there
hold on
remember this passionate day
let ' s forget about the past two days
this is no good
work shouldn’t be like this
why ' d you sleep holding me ?
you got into my arms
geez
you slept on the floor ?
on the bed …
i can ' t believe this
just thank me
you wouldn ' t let me rest and you want a compliment ?
you and i both
rest by doing work
what ?
that sounds like a nightmare
don’t say that please
gosh our new employees must ' ve worked hard
here
oh my !
it reminded me of how we worked on the china housing construction
the human mind is so fickle
you get ignored by team members you trusted
find out their thoughts
get sick
and want to drop everything
then because of these few pages
life is all about change
but
what are you concerned about these days ?
what ' s your worry ?
what is it that you want to heal yourself with work ?
i feel stuffy
can you get some air ?
our team is like a bullet
and a shield
mr choi is really
amazing
i hate myself for putting up with
him when i know his intentions
let me guess
why you ' re doing this
what ?
you want to see who wins right ?
you think you ' re at the point to do that
your unscientific views
what ?
you think you ' re fighting with mr choi
if you succeed with the poshin case
he will have to acknowledge
you and your team
support is necessary since the
vice president position is on the line
aren ' t i right ?
ok
then how ' s this ?
one thing is for sure
with a $05 bil order promotion to a dept head is possible
and after that
you get the authority to use whoever you want
that ' s the company rule
geu rae
you still think he can ' t make it ?
will i become a full-timer if i continue working like this ?
i told him he won ' t
high hopes
and irresponsible consolation are all useless
the company is tough
so you need to be strong
one thing is for sure
with a $05 bil order promotion to a dept head is possible
and after that
you get the authority to use whoever you want
dong sik was screwed
when will he get promoted if the leader keeps bringing unprofitable work ?
should i wake the kids up ?
oh let them sleep
this is nice
i ' ll ask my mom for some mustard leaf kimchi
ok
that ' s nice
your mom ' s kimchi
don ' t you hate me at times ?
maybe you always do
it ' s faster to tell you when i adore you
i like it when you eat my food without complaining
maybe i ' ve changed after i got married
tell me
what ?
you know …
can i
do something for someone ?
can i
butt in about someone else ' s life again ?
you think it ' s right to
help others ?
you can forget about it now
let eun ji go now
just bury her
what …
do it just do it
do whatever you want
you haven ' t done anything wrong that ' s what i think
you would do the same thing if you could do it all over again
and i think that ' s right
come on i ' m not that important
exactly
you only think about what you think is right
everything else doesn ' t go however you want it to
you ' re acting all influential
you think you ' ll just be able to boss people around ?
i thought you were saving the country or something
the soup is salty
don’t eat it it ' s ok come on
he never gets sick
he rarely catches a cold
i can ' t believe he took a half-day off
he ' s has a lot on his plate these days
he helped with ms sun ' s work on the weekend
he must ' ve overworked himself
he ' ll have to make a decision by today
i ' m worried
you only think about what you think is right
everything else doesn ' t go however you want it to
maybe dad didn ' t go to work today
maybe he slept in
maybe he ' s going in late since he got promoted
you can ' t go in late because of that
maybe he ' ll get in trouble
hey kids ! you should go to school
what are you doing ?
yes
yay ! bye
bye !
come in
jang geu rae !
it ' s not mr oh ' s style
then why did he accept this business ?
why sales team 3 ?
what else ?
switch to a full-time position ?
if i can help with anything …
i ' m young yi ' s dad
something ' s fishy
he got bribed
sang sik
if he gets promoted he can become a full-timer
mr oh
i ' ll make it happen
you only think about what you think is right
everything else doesn ' t go however you want it to
this is a surprise
you didn ' t like that nice suit since it becomes wrinkly easily
yeah just go classy today since you need all the luck you can have
order good food and take a taxi there
see you later
yeah ?
good thinking
hi
is mr choi in ?
come in
welcome
sit down
your concerns are leading to results
it ' s a good thing it didn ' t lead to disappointment
poshin joined the national solar energy business recently
so the variable isn ' t reflected
in the solar panel business
so reflect that
and have your team show what you ' ve got
yes sir
it ' s been a long time since we ' ve worked together
it feels great
it reminds me of the old days
and i feel passionate about it
mr choi
mm-hmm
i have a question
why me ?
why sales team 3 ?
why you ask ?
i ' m asking you because you ' re oh sang sik
oh sang sik
would there be any other reason ?
let ' s have lunch later
sure
you decided to do it ?
will it be ok ?
you did good
we can hopefully move away from the restroom
go over this geu rae
two items ? yeah
this solar energy development is a $500 mil business
what ?
$500 mil ?
how do connections work ?
connections ?
decrease our margin by controlling the original costs
and increase poshin ' s profits
mr oh
i ' d do anything you want to do
but the fact that they might not get
the power plant business is what
you ' re concerned about too
yeah as of now
as of now ?
there ' s a way to eliminate the risk factors
the chinese government wants quality solar panels and facilities
they want a company that does much
business and can handle a big development
from poshin ' s position
the more solar panels they have
the higher their chances to get the business
the more solar panels they have ?
hold on
but why did the company before
have such a small scale ?
since it wasn ' t linked to the power plant business
things changed recently
so it depends on how we do ?
so we actually have the upper
hand regarding connections
yeah
stop the nonsense
ask what poshin thinks about our plan dong sik
find out if any quality solar panel
exporters are connected to us
yes
there are some in the us and
europe as well as here in korea
ok
read that carefully and
support your bosses geu rae
yes
don ' t act like the captain like last time
if you act like a slacking philosopher again i ' ll fire you
ok go out and work
yes yes
but what do you mean by  " connections ?  "
it ' s better if you don ' t know it
come on it ' s part of the business manual
geu rae isn ' t like a pure organic being
they say in china connections come first in business
for the chinese personal relationships
are more important than the law
especially in business
so give me an example ?
don ? t simply think of it as bribery
emotional bonding is the priority
but it ' s definitely not mr oh ' s style
then why ' d he accept this business ?
and mr choi ?
according to mr chun it ' s to get
away from the restroom of course
i hate the smell don ' t you ?
it ' s time we move away
here
your dead project came back alive
the headquarters said they want yours
sir
then what about mr ma ' s team 3 ?
geez
congratulations
congratulations ?
we ' re really dead now
what will we do ?
be quiet
we could be sent to sales team 3 ' s spot
it stinks there
thank you
it ' s thanks to all of you
i ' ll get you all a cup of coffee
yeah ?
it ' s been a long time
what ?
that you didn ' t seem to wear it for a long time
oh this ?
what ?
what ' s been a long time ?
baek ki
what what ?
there ' s no water
change the water young yi
making the guy always do it is reverse discrimination
that ? s what mr ha would say right ?
my legs my legs ?
alright
wow
thank you baek ki
your dress shirt looks really nice
wait wait
this is
pima cotton and this type of fabric
is made with high standards
it ' s a quality shirt
easy to dye with a smooth finish
psyche
it ' s not that great
still you must ' ve spent a small fortune
but i don ? t think it ' s baek ki ' s style ?
geez
why don ' t you use the 16th floor
pantry instead of the 15th ?
they don ' t have this
you ' re not there nor young yi
young yi
young yi ?
uh ?
this was that expensive ?
no i bought it on sale
so don ' t worry
but you hadn ' t worn it
so i thought you didn ' t like it
no
it ' s just a bit tight
i worked out and lost weight to wear it
i ' ll get going
your coffee ?
is it high quality ?
sir
i see chungsol is set as the supplier
have you reviewed it again ?
yeah why ?
is there a problem ?
the company with lots of delays ?
i know
mr sung contemplated on that
so we decided to penalize them in case
of another delay by the contract
what ?
i told you an oral contract is enough
but he added it in the contract
gosh you ' re so meticulous
is that true ?
are you my superior or something ?
am i obligated to report such things to you ?
go check the contract
what ?
you can ' t believe it right ?
it upsets you to see me acknowledge
the delays and do that ?
i have much more experience
than you dude
no matter how hard you try
you can ' t beat me you know
what a joke
i ' ve seen you drink during lunch before
now you don ' t ?
i don ' t think it ' ll be helpful for work later
just drink a little
yes sir
partner management could
be the core to work
they say it has changed but china
is still all about connections
it works despite the views on it
i lived in china for five years
all my chinese partners are on their own now
they ' re all doing well
i think businesses should be based at facilities
the fulfillment ?
those you leave at some point after making profit
are no good anymore
it should go for a lifetime
you should make a lifelong friend too
sang sik
let ' s
make this happen
yes sir
and ?
i knew you wouldn ' t have saved my number
gosh
no eight your number
the number eight is a lucky number in china
let ' s talk on the phone like we used to
yeah
sales team 3 jang geu rae speaking
mr chun ?
he ' s on the phone right now
yes
your number is ?
i will contact you once we find the right one
i ' ll tell him to call you thanks
bye
the products of solar team korea meet poshin ' s requirements
so i got their number
thanks sure
sales team 3 kim dong sik speaking
oh thank you
i ' m sorry i didn ' t know it was the ceo ' s phone number
oh yes
we ' ll try our best with the supply too
thank you
china is proactive just like mr oh said
yeah since it ' s a breakthrough for poshin too
geu rae yes
find the person in charge at the trade association
and get detailed data on poshin yes
have a good day geu rae
i see she keeps contacting you
she tells me how she ' s doing at times
i think she ' s interested in you
no
be nice to her
maintain her pride for her
just reply to the text
it ' s hard for me
ha ?  hard ?
wow
it ' s just a nice simple reply
don ' t over think it
you know
the day we drank together after your blind date ?
let ' s go for round two !
where shall we go ? round two
geu rae !
where shall we go ?
let ' s go next time
ok
bye bye
oh see you next time
see you
if we see each other again yes
but why are you following him ?
i go in the same direction as him
bye !
come on you should go
where do you live ?
right over there
go now
i ' m almost home
ok go home then
i ' m on my way home too
where do you live ?
you live here ?
yes don ? t send me any more useless texts
ok
i ' ll send you useful texts from now on
bye-bye !
how ' d you know my number ?
i asked so mi ' s mom
it ' s pressuring
oh it ' s pressuring for captain jang ?
you don ' t know how lucky you are
mr kim
treat her well she seemed nice
it ' s not easy for a girl to be that aggressive
it ' s not the time for me to be dating now
what ?
what ?
it is of course
if you wait around you ' ll become a crappy old bachelor like me
right mr chun ?
of course there ' s a time for everything
then is it time for me to become crap ?
tell me no
what did poshin say ?
they like it as expected
they want as much supply as possible
i ' m looking into solar panel companies
it ' ll take time to go over the us germany and korea
right
but mr oh ?
what ?
poshin doesn ? t have a middle manager
what do you mean ?
i called the number on the file
and their ceo answered the phone
their ceo ?
yes
isn ' t it good if the ceo is on the same line ?
he ' s taking care of it himself since it ' s important
just like mr choi does it himself here
because it ' s our business
if there are no middle managers like us
who will take responsibility if there ' s an issue later ?
what issue ?
mr oh what ' s wrong with you ?
as soon as the solar panels are ready approve and submit it
i told you it ' s all set
the approval is just a formality
no olives but onion ?
a lot
ok
i will be back
where are you going ? out to buy sandwiches for snacks
are you ok ?
yeah
geu rae yes
let ' s be prudent with work
excuse me ?
yes sir
hello
i ' ll take your order
i ' ll have four sandwiches
one without olives lots of onion and heat them all please
yes
your team team the same taste as us
baek ki
new employees will have to come for us to leave these errands
your team seemed busy today
we have urgent work to do
mr choi ? yes
though it ' s weird why mr oh accepted it
right he doesn ' t like him
but i think that decision was
possible since it ' ll help the team
i was angry and i resented him
but i realized i needed suk yool and
had to acknowledge him
since there ' s a difference you can ' t overcome
with just pride and stubbornness
the leader has to think
of the team members
for mr chun mr kim and ?
did mr oh say anything else ?
no
i see
let ' s go
baek ki yes
the schedule has changed so you won ' t have to work late
is that right ?
mr kang
i have a question
what is it ?
what changes when a team grows ?
what ?
so
when the team ' s position changes or size grows ?
you ' ll need that much more manpower
the dept head can ask for more people
then
can you switch temps to full-timers ?
that should be possible
why ?
nothing
see you tomorrow
going home ?
yes mr oh
i heard your team is working late
yeah geu rae was complaining again ?
no
mr oh
uh ?
i heard you started a new business
yeah
uh ?
i ' m sure it won ' t happen
but if i mean if you need my help
let me know
ok
hi dong sik
yeah it ' s on the desk
it started coming off a few days ago
maybe it really costs a fortune
but it ' s definitely not mr oh ' s style
mr choi ?
yes
though it ' s weird why mr oh accepted it
but i think that decision was
possible since it ' ll help the team
however i still have this doubt
in my heart i can ' t get rid of
why ?
mr oh was insisting on it like never before
mr oh ?
it seemed like he decided not to make trouble about
poshin not having a middle manager
yes
yes the model ?
we focused on securing solar panels instead
procuring the companies went smoothly
regarding the supply costs and quality too
poshin agreed that the conditions were great
is this right mr oh ?
mr oh sent a contract to poshin
now only approval is left
everything seemed to be going smoothly
then something unexpected happened
why these ?  !
what ' s wrong ?
connect me to poshin ' s ceo
why me ?
why sales team 3 ?
i ' m asking you because you ' re oh sang sik
oh sang sik
would there be any other reason ?
was this why ?
mr choi ?
we need to go through an agent ?
and the commission is 25% ?
the contract we sent didn ? t say that did it ?
the ceo is saying it was agreed upon verbally
what ?
verbally with whom ?
mr choi ?
uh ?
so they ' ll take 25% out of our 3% margin ?
then our profit would decrease to 05%
we decreased the 5% margin to
3% considering the connections
but commission and an unnecessary agent ?
the 3% was set reflecting the
connections in the original cost
but the sudden agent and commission
from our margin could be a problem
i have a different opinion
it ' s not like the margin is zero
and many of our businesses have 05% margin
if we were to consider the potential growth of solar energy power plants
i think this could be considered connections too
i don ' t think there would be a problem
well
i have to say something at least
i don ' t know what ' s going on for sure
but i could feel disharmony
just like trying to squeeze into unfitting clothes
it felt unnatural
i had so many questions
what ' s going on ?
did you know about the tough conditions ?
the adjusted costs were already reflected in the contract
now it says our margin is lower and
there will be an agent designated by poshin
this is just too much
mr oh
just approve and drop it
then
you knew all about it ?
the profit may be small but the
figures are fine within the company
alright
let ' s say we use an agent
but don ? t you think the 25% commission is too much ?
there ' s no problem !
sir
i don ? t feel good about this business
with the middle manager this and all ?
if something happens
our team will die
come on who ' s going to die ?
you don ' t need to worry so much
please have some faith
you shouldn ? t be on this case now
wrap it up and focus on the solar energy power plant business !
that ' s why you ' re doing this anyway !
hold the china item for now
will that be ok ?
record all the calls
related to china for now
what ?
what ?
geu rae yes
you had contacted the resident
employee in china before right ?
yes mr suk
have you talked with him ever since then ?
i thanked him before
and what did he say ?
is he trustworthy ?
i didn ' t think he was flaky
call him
ask him to find out what the agent poshin designated is like
and whether there were other cases
where an agent was suddenly introduced
among poshin ' s items
tell him to call me directly
yes sir
it should be taken care of quietly
ok ?
yes sir
we need to go through an agent ?
and the commission is 25% ?
the ceo is saying it was agreed upon verbally
what ?
verbally with whom ?
we decreased the 5% margin to
3% considering the connections
but commission and an unnecessary agent ?
the 3% was set reflecting the connections in the original cost
but the sudden agent and commission
from our margin could be a problem
hold the china item for now
record all the calls related to china for now
something ' s weird
but it ' s definitely not mr oh ' s style
then why ' d he accept this business ?
and it ' s mr choi ?
mr choi ?
yes
yes sir thank you
sir yes
about chungsol ?
do you know they were sued for order delays ?
yeah mr sung gave me the report yesterday
you knew about it ?
but you still approved ?
i told you a penalty condition for delays was added
but a lawsuit is still not good
so why should we work with them ?
that ' s true
but mr sung guarantees it
so i ' m just trusting him
what ?
if a meticulous guy has such conviction
there must be a reason for it
sir i ' m back
hi
sir
i want to buy a car
pick one for me
a car ?
what you ' re going to buy something this expensive ?
i ' ll sign a contract with my bonus
i haven ' t spent it yet
you ' ll pay the rest in installments ?
did you have lunch ?
oh ?
hi
hi
see you at the garden
baek ki
what is it ?
what ' s going on ?
so uh ?
i thought the shirt was so expensive
what ?
i already found out so i had to do something
it cost $50000
and i really bought it at an outlet
so no worries at all
thank you
sure
see if it ' s your size
shall i ?
it fits perfectly
take care of the heels
i normally don ' t wear heels
what you bought it for her ?
uh ?
good job ?
i was going to buy you a pair
every time handsome young yi wears heels i feel uneasy
your right heel is shaky right ?
why ' d you observe my shoes ?
i didn ' t observe them your shoes caught my attention
your shoes did it not me
your shaky shoes
ok ok
i ' m glad you ' re here
let me hear your opinion
ok let ' s say there ' s a company
we buy it and sell it so we have the upper hand
but we have to serve them we have to
we should be on the receiving end
and they ' d been sued for not meeting deadlines
i ' m talking about that company
but they still go ahead with the contract
by adding articles to it
what is this ?
you don ? t know ?
i don ? t know
bribery is going on
bribery
i ' m sure of it
bribery ?
mr seok has called sir
hi mr seok this is sang sik
hello mr oh
work is tough isn ' t it ?
no sir
the agent you asked about is a corporation
but there ' s not much info since they ' re new
i looked into poshin
but they never used an agent before
if necessary they had one to begin with
and the 25% commission is absurd
you mean it ' s a lot ?
yes it ' s usually 1%
and our margin was 3% right ?
right
according to those in charge
considering the quality solar panel conditions
and the situation where we had helped them
we could have highered our margin
and it ' s an urgent item for poshin too
it ' s strange right ?
ah no
they must have their reasons
thanks i appreciate it
new ?
our margin could ' ve been higher than 5%
which is before reflecting connections ?
so what do you think mr oh ?
by any chance ?
sir do you ?
do you think mr choi is receiving a rebate ?
mr oh you should drop this case
i understand why you want to do it but
the team could end up being eliminated
mr oh
why are you hesitating ?
you have another plan ?
geu rae is on the line
what ?
what ?
yeah
how are things going ?
what ?
the new business ?
what are you so worried about ?
oh nothing
geu rae
i don ' t know what ' s on your mind
but just do it
don ' t look back
don ? t ask any questions and ?
trust mr oh
and do it
why should i ?
you said so
that this business is meant for mr oh to build up the team
if that happens and he becomes dept head you could
have the chance to become a full-timer
geu rae
i don ' t know what you ' re concerned about
but i wish
you ' d do it
switch to a full-timer ?
yes this is a good opportunity
that ' s why
if i insist the team could get in trouble
but if i quit
geu rae could be losing his last chance
mr oh
there ' s no proof mr choi is receiving a rebate
please give it some more thought
yes mr oh
if geu rae ' s on the line
i want to do the best i can too
if that happens and he becomes dept head you could
have the chance to become a full-timer
hi
where are you now ?
i ' m on the way back
i have something to tell you
go ahead
yes sir
yes
i ' ll get some air i need to think things through too
yes sir
do you think mr choi is receiving a rebate ?
geu rae is on the line
if i insist the team could get in trouble
but if i quit
geu rae could be losing his last chance
what is it why ?
is it because of me ?
what ?
all the strange circumstances with this case ?
things you wouldn ' t have ignored normally ?
this time you ' re overlooking them
is it because of me ?
you ' re so arrogant !
please stop if it ' s for me
i don ? t understand what you mean !
and what do you mean strange circumstances ?
stop the nonsense and go work
i couldn ' t understand why an agent appeared out of nowhere on the contract
and a commission was requested too
i call the shots
i ' m saying this out of concern that
i might ' ve affected your judgment
arrogant kid
who are you to say my judgment ? you ' re trying to save me
you ' re
trying to make me a full-timer
isn ' t that why
you ' re working with people who you normally never would ?
i don ' t want to put the team in danger
please
don ' t do it
i don ' t know what you ' re thinking !
but if you want to criticize mr choi save your breath
yes we don ' t get along
but we can keep our personal lives and work separate !
he and i both !
you think work is a joke ?
i think mr choi has ulterior motives
i think he ' s using us
don ' t be absurd !
he ' s produced much greater results than you !
also his contribution to this company is a lot greater than me !
he ' s worked for the company much longer than you or me !
he might hate me but he wouldn ' t
hurt his team or company !
don ' t worry i ' ll make this work
no one will have trouble
i ' ll find a solution to get the best results
mr oh
right it ' s a chance to save you
so i ' ll do what i can why you ask ?
if i don ' t do it now
even if the chance comes next time
i don ' t know if i ' ll feel the same way
i told him he won ' t make it
it ' s tougher than eun ji ' s times
what ' s the use of high hopes
and irresponsible consolation ?
many people are desperate for
those words or consolation
still he won ' t make it
go down
your job is to work
don ? t do anything besides that
don ' t have suspicions about anything
i can tell that you love your shoes
don ' t be so overt
you ' re embarrassing me
well whenever i get new shoes
i become more careful to walk ladylike
any problems with r&d ?
you can ask sang hyun for help if necessary
what ?
he said he has a close friend who could help
young yi
who is this ?
i ' m young yi ' s dad
oh yes
hello
i ' m jang baek ki and we started work together
go ahead
see you tomorrow
ok
i called mr shin
let ' s go for some rice and soup
i want to eat rice for a change
don ' t be like that
you ' re choking me
your mom has a cold
her bones hurt too with arthritis or something
you should see her
you can hate me
but don ? t hate your mom
how ' d you know where i worked ?
i called mr shin
i visited him recently
why ' d you visit him ?
just to say hi ok ?
he said he met you there and you ' re doing well ?
he was complimenting you
i went to thank him
i was late but i owed him that
i kept myself from going because you were dead against it
think about my position
he lent me so much money so i ' d be
a guy with no manners or conscience
so
what brings you here ?
i heard you got a new bank account
you paid it all off ?
i was going to help somehow
but i ' m sorry i couldn ? t
don ? t waste your money
and save as much as you can
that way you can use it in an emergency
oh yeah
uh ?
wire me $500 if you can
what should i do ?
what should i do to escape from you dad ?
wire it
shall we have a drink ?
this is my dad
dot dot dot
he really makes me speechless
my dad was a soldier
he was upset that i wasn ? t born a boy
he always said  " you should ' ve been born a boy "
he always told my mom  " don ' t put too much effort into the girl "
they never helped with tuition
so here it ' s  " they went to school ?  "
i started working part-time from high school
here ' s your pizza
my dad quit and started this and that business
he got swindled and went bankrupt
then he took my paycheck too
i went to college on a full scholarship
i worked part-time and gave him money again
but i couldn ? t get free
i got a job before i graduated
yes
at samjung
you know shin woo hyun ?
yes
he was my boss
but why ?
how much is your yearly pay ?
how are the benefits ?
since it ' s a big company you can get a big loan right ?
i ' m going to open a store
i loaned money from
the bank to help him out
but it didn ' t stop
there was no way
then my dad
went to mr shin
without telling me
mr shin
taught me how to live as ahn young yi
not a girl who ' s sorry for not being a boy
good job
china or arabian buyers don ? t think the person in charge would be female
whenever you ' re in a meeting with guys always sit in the middle
yes
the fulfillment of labor and
myself
my future ?
i started to value them
until i learned my dad had borrowed money from him
why ' d you do that ?
why didn ' t you ask me ?
you thought i ' d appreciate it ?
you thought i ' d thank you forever ?
i didn ' t want such circumstances to shake you
shake me ?
who ?
that ' s what he said ?
that i ' d have trouble without the money ?
young yi drop it !
you ' re a hypocrite
you did it knowing how pitiful i ' d feel
i know you ' re enjoying this situation
young yi !
i just yelled at him like i was crazy
and
it was over
after quitting samjung
i stayed home for about six months
like i was dead
i wanted to die
then one day
when i was watching a documentary on tv
i realized i shouldn ' t die like that
what documentary was it ?
i don ? t know
it was about company workers
arguing over who ' d pay for lunch
they looked pathetic
i thought i should be among them
i wanted to
live my life
did you like
mr shin ?
young yi
yes
shall we go see a late-night horror movie ?
what ?
you can ' t watch horror
uh ?
i suddenly felt
i could watch one
then let ' s have some red
blood soup afterwards
that ' s too much for me as of yet
let ' s go
sure
don ' t worry i ' ll make this work
no one will have trouble
i ' ll find a solution to get the best results
right it ' s a chance to save you
so i ' ll do what i can why you ask ?
if i don ' t do it now
even if the chance comes next time
i don ' t know if i ' ll feel the same way
please update the subsidiary material shipment status
yes
last time the factory manager complained due to the delay
the fabric is on time and under process
so don ? t worry
yes as long as the materials are
on time and the sooner the better
thank you
bye
bribery
i ' m sure that ' s involved
i ' m sure of it
gosh what is he thinking about now ?
did he get yelled at gain ?
i don ? t think it ' s right time for him
hi
what ' s going on with geu rae ?
i don ' t know is something wrong ?
how come you don ' t care ?
is he an outcast ?
is something wrong ? baek ki
something must ' ve happened to geu rae but you don ? t know right ?
what ?
i don ' t
what could he be so worried about ?
ok us newbies should get together for lunch later
did you hear anything about him ?
no
i think mr choi has ulterior motives
i think he ' s using us
don ' t be absurd !
he ' s produced much greater results than you !
and his contribution to this company is a lot greater than me !
he ' s worked for the company much longer than you or me !
he might hate me but he wouldn ' t
hurt his team or company !
geu rae
yes
what are you thinking about now ?
nothing
yeah right
i told you not to be a philosopher
mr oh ? we finished our talk last night
mr oh
do your work
mr oh
if you or the company has any trouble because of me
it ' s all useless
your intentions
to save me are more than enough sir
hi mom
you must be busy i ' ll make it quick
ok
which dry cleaners is your tie at ?
i need to get it for you
kim ' s or lee ' s ?
lee ' s closed down
oh right
ok bye
mom
yeah
i ' m busy hurry up
i ' m busy hurry up
mom
do you want to do public services ?
what ?
when i took my intern test
you complained that you couldn ' t go if i passed
of course i want to !
bye
come home early
ok
hello ?
geu rae
mr seok
hello
hi where ' s mr oh ?
he ' s away at the moment
you can tell me if it ' s urgent
i ' ll give him this recording
i contacted poshin and rumor has it
if this solar panel order works out
the power plant business will practically take off
then there ' s no reason for one international
to take these conditions right ?
don ' t we have a supporting role so that poshin can obtain the business
by securing supplies ?
right
so i told mr oh there won ' t be
any problem with a much bigger margin
but poshin is requesting the margin
we deserve as the agent ' s commission ?
under the name of connections
right
mr seok
i have a question
then aren ' t the roles
reversed right now ?
i don ' t know how mr choi made that judgment
but our company actually has the upper hand right ?
mr seok
geu rae !
see it to the end even if you don ' t think it ' ll work
we have no choice but to run now
did he just grab it ?
i ' m disappointed in mr oh
don ' t say that when you don ' t even know !
we ' re from the headquarters
we heard your team has a recording
what is this ?
in life there are many things you start knowing how it ' ll end
i have a question
then aren ' t the roles
reversed right now ?
i don ' t know how mr choi made that judgment
but our company actually has the upper hand right ?
mr seok
geu rae !
geu rae
what were you thinking ?
what did i …
connect me to mr seok
our youngest one made a mistake
no way
we don’t think so at all
i told you last time it ' s
to make things clear
don ' t worry
recording ?
come on i already deleted it
yeah
i ' ll treat you to soju when you come to korea
have a good day
mr chun and mr kim
leave the room
you couldn ' t believe me till the end ?
mr oh i told you i ' d take care of it
geu rae
listen carefully
what you did today could
actually put the team in danger
why did geu rae do something so foolish ?
even if he ' s not familiar …
mr seok must be so nervous now
it ' s like saying mr choi is corrupt
and mr seok is in on it too
mr seok is not in the position to take responsibility for his words
so there ' s no telling what he ' ll do if he gets negative vibes about this
and there ' s no proof for
your distrust in mr choi
if the case gets out of hand
and mr choi is proven to have no fault at all
our team and you will have to
take responsibility since you started it
geu rae found out ?
mm-hmm
you ' re trying to save me
you ' re
trying to make me a full-timer
he thinks he ' s affecting mr oh ' s judgment
so i think he wanted to confirm his suspicions
he must ' ve wanted to save the team
though it was immature
i ' m sure he couldn ' t take it thinking it was his fault
that fool
he should ' ve discussed it with me
uh mr oh
i ' ve put mr seok at ease
so things won ' t get out of hand
in order to make sure of that
we need to show him we ' re working again
you ' re right
we have no choice but to keep dashing now
check each company ' s contract
make sure it ' s checked thoroughly by others too
double check poshin ' s contract
and make sure the details are favorable to us
what about the agent ?
i ' ll go talk to mr choi
yeah the agent was confirmed
the details didn ' t exist in the previous files
didn ' t i tell you the circumstances have changed ?
i mean the solar energy power plant business
i thought the connections would take care of that
no that ' s the norm
we need something additional
categories were just divided with potential issues in mind
just think of it all as connections
then our profit rate from the
solar panel business would be 05%
that means it ' s nearly zero
considering the business ' characteristics
mr oh it ' s despite that
mr choi
i ' ve worked here for 28 years
i grew with this company
i always showed them results
i mean always
when the economy was bad and other companies were in trouble
you know how we were ?
we found a market using all my lines in china
i saved the company each time
i helped it grow and that ' s how it grew
this was all possible because i had
made family-like business partners there
it ' s no different this time
no matter how much we pay for the connections
it ' s for the company
i respect whatever way you had helped the company grow
but please don ' t use that method
for this case
we ' ll proceed with the original contract we had sent
mr oh
that ' s what the company approved
and that i can accept
so please help this business go smoothly
please delete the details on the agent sir
or we won ' t be able to work on this business
if that ' s deleted
we ' ll definitely get the second business too
i ' ll make sure there ' s no problem
with you becoming vice president
mr oh
proceed as the original without the agent
will that be ok ?
yeah
geu rae did you get replies for the emails you sent to domestic companies ?
yes they ' re on your desk
did you threaten mr choi ?
will that be ok ?
he ' ll accept it
he has to become vice president
your team is good
securing that much supply within a short period of time …
do you work well with them ?
yes
why are you so nervous ?
you still get nervous around me ?
oh what do you think ?
do you think it ' ll be impressive enough
even without the agent details ?
enough for poshin to want to give us the next business ?
i
my opinion is
i don ' t know
but
but mr oh will make it succeed
so please trust him
he didn ' t tell you about geu rae ?
mr park i asked chungsol so many times for the parts statement
it was delayed then replaced to
cheap items not once but many times
i said no
you don ' t care ?
mr lee said it was ok …  ?
no please call me after you find a solution
yes
how much will the frigging mr sung get ?
chungsol has to replace parts again
yeah ?
they must ' ve done so since they couldn ' t get the original ones
they must ' ve done so ?
you know it ' s not that simple the quality will …
will be fine just be quiet
they can ' t change it i ' ll have them come now
hey
have them come ?
if you need them you go
don ' t you know what the times are like ?
hello ?
yes sir i heard about it
no just proceed with it i ' ll get permission for it
meeting the deadline is more important
no you don ' t need to come
i ' ll call you back in a minute
jerk you made the factory come to a stall
till when should i clean up after your mess ?
no sir
come on think of our relationship
geez
yes
i received it
i know i ' ve received a lot
so i ' ll pay you back
i ' ll keep paying you back !
geez !
ok
i ' ll pay back all of it
see you tomorrow evening
i ' ll talk to you in person bye
dang
what is this ?
i was hoping my suspicions weren ' t true
oh my gosh
he ' s really doing something fishy ?
geez
hi have you seen geu rae ?
we couldn ' t have lunch together
he won ' t answer your calls either ?
no the office is vacant and his team must be super busy
yeah
maybe it ' s because of that
what ?
there ' s a china-related business
mr ma and resource team 3 were on it originally
but mr choi seemed to have given it over to sales team 3
the scale is quite large
about $05 billion ?
$05 billion ?
yes
if it ' s a success the team could expand
i ' m a bit disappointed in mr oh
i thought he was against all of mr choi ' s intention
i felt the same way
but work is work
but i ' m still disappointed
maybe he just grabbed the rope given to him
what are you talking about ?
oh geu rae
don ' t say whatever you want when you don ' t know what you ' re talking about !
don ' t …  !
don ' t say whatever you want
geu rae we …
geu rae …
right it ' s a chance to save you
so i ' ll do what i can why you ask ?
if i don ' t do it now
even if the chance comes next time
i don ' t know if i ' ll feel the same way
i think mr oh accepted mr choi ' s case
since he can make geu rae a full-timer
make him a full-timer ?
since he can ask for more people
if he becomes head of the dept
then how can that succeed ?
i mean what can i do here ?
what can we do ?
probably nothing
no i ' m sure there ' s
something like ms sun ' s …
no
no suk yool
this is different from that time
i asked you to come play go why won ' t you come ?
i ' m sorry
ok come when you have time
see you
hello ?
sales team 3 oh sang sik speaking
this is mr choi ' s secretary speaking
yes
he ' d like to have dinner with you
come on in
i invited him
i thought i was being too careless
after giving responsibilities
he ' s done a lot for the company
and i felt i ought to treat him
since i had chosen him as you said
i don ' t know if he ' s serious for his age
or shy
i asked him to come for a game of go but he won ' t come
oh you heard of this right geu rae ?
" a good move for me could be
good for the opponent too "
let ' s eat the bass looks good
geu rae has a lot of work today sir
is that so ?
yes
i guess we have no choice
let ' s eat together next time
yes sir
come to think of it
isn ' t there a reason you need this business too ?
i had you come since you seemed to have forgotten it
some people only think of winning
and having the opponent lose
they ' re bound to lose in the long run
i like to lose and have the opponent win
i don ' t like either winning or losing
let ' s have a win-win situation
you win and i win
isn ' t there a reason you need this business too ?
let ' s have a win-win situation
you win and i win
i ' ll do it
however you ' d like
but i can ' t just trust you
like i did with lee eun ji
so ?
i ' ll make this case work no matter what
so
please give me a definite answer
promise me that you won ' t ask our team to be responsible
for anything related to connections
promise ?
should i sign a contract ?
it ' ll be an arbitrary decision
i ' ll take responsibility if there are any issues
is that definite enough of an answer for you ?
that ' s not enough ?
i don ' t know what mr choi ' s thinking
i was sure he chose our team as the bullets and the shield
but he answers me so easily
circumstances always change
you made progress up until the point of signing the deal
you ' ve been a much bigger success than mr choi expected
your team is bullets for him now
effective and fast bullets at that
plus he ' s purpose-driven
you should just focus on your purpose too
yes mr lee
yes
i ' ll see you there at 6:30
don ' t give this month ' s accounts over to general affairs yet
why not ?
must i sacrifice myself when i ' m cleaning up for your mess ?
yes sir
what about headquarters '  work environment improvement survey ?
just check and submit it
since the spent expenses for the final report should be perfect
i revised this to this
ok looks good
hello
you should wrap up work in the office
don ' t give kids stress
you should quit smoking yourself
hasn ' t young yi said you smell gross ?
no she hasn ' t
headquarters will do environment improvement survey right ?
oh yes
it ' s such a hassle
nothing changes even if you tell them
sir you said you needed to go to finance
hello
we ' re from headquarters for a work environment improvement survey
i ' m kang min gyung and this is
our new employee lee yun suh
hello
you can give out the surveys now
you can give it back to me after you fill it out
they must ' ve fallen for her
no way
yun suh !
don ' t put your pen in your mouth that ' s rude
i ' m sorry
i ' m sorry give it to us we ' ll do it
don ' t give the whole thing to him !
i ' ll do it i ' m sorry
i ' m sorry
i ' m sorry
i ' m sorry
they say the enemy of women are women
she ' s being mean because she ' s younger and prettier
what ' s wrong with putting the pen in her mouth ?
personal habits in public settings aren ' t good
she should ' ve been told off
she was just cute
hello
cute ?
she lacked the basics
her boss lacked the basics
she embarrassed her
embarrassed ?
i ' d like to ask young yi how she ' s felt till now
mr kang
i always thought your taste in girls was unique
what do you mean ?
you like stick-skinny girls like her
stiff girls that are cold-blooded
watch what you say
i like girls who are proper
you like giggly pushovers don ' t you ?
come on get your words straight
i like warm girls who
can make others smile
i think you like thin or curvy girls
anyway the new employee is my type
she ' s cute
who do you like better baek ki ?
what ?
i think ms kang would be fussy
see ?
your taste is weird
yeah
you ' re loyal man
uh mr kang
i ' m disappointed in your taste in women
what ' s going on ?
you ' ve been working here for over a year and you still don ' t get it ?
the boss '  taste is the bible
to corny jokes you go … laugh hysterically
to his taste in food … " that ' s yummy "
when he wants to smoke " i ' ll go with you "
you need to adjust to his taste in music art politics and society
but you know what ' s way on top of all that ?
taste in girls taste in girls
you should always say his is the best
only if you like that boss
hello
hello
mr kang still doesn ' t acknowledge it right ?
what ?
oh yeah
his taste in girls is weird
it ' s ready thanks
young yi you saw them who was prettier among the two ?
i thought the new employee was much more charming
right ?
see girls have accurate judgment
so i want to learn to act cute
since i lack that
she ' s the best learner
clearly different from book-smart baek ki
different in every way
oh i better go
" learn to act cute …  "
we should be able to say that as company employees
where did suk yool go ?
i ' m glad i renewed my driver ' s license
meeting at the waterfront of the han river …
someone ' s watched a lot of movies
nice
gosh it ' s mr lee alright
mr sung is so nervous
now give him money money
money for bribery
what ' s that ?
suk yool
what ?
hi geu rae
getting off work ? yes
ok
is something wrong ?
no
ok see you tomorrow
geu rae
is work going smoothly ?
what ?
it should go smoothly it has to
see you tomorrow
right life throws tough quizzes
at you to make you helpless
but it leaves you hints in funny places at times
but of course there ' s no guarantee
the answers you get are correct
hi
don ' t get up
mr choi
sit down
you ' re working hard
let me know if you need anything
yeah mr kim will be losing some weight
have a good day
after that day between mr oh and mr choi
our team seemed like they wanted to succeed no matter what
we only focused on work
we didn ' t think about anything else
mr oh yes
about this what will you do for after measures ?
the sample test results …
then one day …
oh sang sik speaking
headquarters ?
mr oh sang sik ?
yes
we ' re from headquarters
we were checking on each affiliate ' s
belt-tightening policies and got a tip-off
tip-off ?
in the headquarters ' monthly earnings statement
there was a document regarding the issue
of mr choi ' s business with china
i heard your team has a recording
recording what ' s that about ?
the tip-off was from china
it must ' ve seemed smart to stay out of the strange game
though mr oh ' s consolation came right after
words were recorded and when a
contract employee pricked his conscience
mr seok indirectly agreed without overt denial
he must ' ve reported it to his boss with anxiety
after receiving his report the manager in china had a hot potato
he got it over to headquarters right away
how many times are you asking me ?
this is totally normal
they ' re saying it ' s not right
you ' ve always worked like this right ?
i mean for a long time
mr choi explained how he had worked for over many decades
but the scale has gone overboard
he thought he could persuade them
but the reality was …
we have all the data sir
look here
so didn ' t mr choi proceed with this
business with strong conviction
without consideration of the company ' s profits ?
did any of the executives not have conviction ?
then i ' ll rephrase that
you said connections are a custom in that society
then do you think this big scale is the norm ?
it can be out of the norm depending on your viewpoint
did you say  " viewpoint ?  "
are you saying it could be viewed as the norm ?
the trading business has many risks
the connections uncertainty
and losses are all analyzed
and for potential relations as a business partner …
partner management could be the core to work
they say it has changed
but china is still all about connections
it works despite the negative views on it
those you leave at some point are no good
mr oh sang sik ?
and for potential relations as a business partner
connections have been made by investments
i think the scale can be determined by
the potential profit we can acquire
then how come there are no connections
to be found in your past work ?
didn ' t you judge connections aren ' t justifiable ?
and it seems the request to the china
resident employee for investigation
after mr choi ' s order was made is similar
the president is here sir
sir
what brings you here ?
you should ' ve called me
i met with auditing team at headquarters
mr choi it ' ll go with the proper procedure
sir this is normal
what ' s the problem with custom ?
you ' re well aware of that
and you said you trust me …
i was aware of it but i don ' t
know if headquarters was too
prepare for anything you need to
he was your choice
oh you guys …
mr jung good job
you should get promoted
ok
go back and work
go now
no sir
let ' s go
mr choi !
i did it ! what ?
i got the deal for the offshore plant epc case !
it ' s the first offshore plant case in korea !
we did it !
yes !
this is great !
we did it !
come here !
no sang sik you did it
mr choi was appointed to unlisted affiliate one global
by raising issues regarding connections
and effort to improve the circumstances
mr oh and sales team 3
weren ' t punished
poshin stopped the solar
heat power plant business
it was in protest to issues about
connections and mr choi ' s punishment
geu rae
go shred this
things were unsettled in the office
rumors about connections spread in chinese firms we had relations with
so some teams suffered direct losses
the reason could be found in mr oh ' s
inflexible work style and side effects
as the days went by
he was blamed for everything
that strong mr oh seemed to waver too
and i knew
that it all started with the careless
words of a certain contract employee
it ' s not your fault
it ' s my fault
i ' m the one who got mr seok
to find out all the details
i ' m the one who made the whole company nervous
as well as you who knew nothing
so i started it and ended it
geez what ' s with you ?
i told you not to be like this !
the one who should be responsible
and take responsibility is
the share and prerogative of those in that position
i hate when you do this
not knowing your place !
i just can ' t believe it
it ' s just  " omg omg "  as kids say !
it ' ll be tough
the scale is different from mr park ' s case
you have one thing you ' re good at !
patience !
let ' s hang in there !
we ' re the tough sales team 3 !
look up
stand tall
the bituminous coal contract went according to your request
we reviewed other companies …
how can you ask to recheck the shipping contract right before production ?
don’t you know verbal contracts have legal validity too ?
isn ' t the contract regarding the
chinese firm that even visited us many times ?
that ' s right abd shipping
right abd shipping among all those companies
they want to review the whole contract
this is all because of sales team 3
mr oh asked about the agent regarding connections through poshin
and rumors must ' ve spread to all the chinese companies
why that …
mr choi leaving is making me anxious as it is
let ' s look for another shipping company
i ' ll look into it now
negotiations are hard when it ' s urgent
we can only choose from japanese firms
their costs are so high
man i ' m going to write on the noticeboard  " leave mr oh !  "
i ' ll select a good company
young yi
i know you ' re worried about mr oh
but we ' re not the only issue here
all the teams related to china will be influenced
we could ' ve continued business with
poshin since our relations were good
don’t you know our team had no choice
with headquarters '  auditing and all ?
while we ' re on the subject
did they have to find out that way ?
it was wrapped up with righteous results and mr choi ' s punishment
but was it worth it ?
poshin stopped it as the issue got out of hand
exactly
a trading man set up the whole
infrastructure and couldn ' t persuade the buyer
think of the potential loss of $05 bil
how can you influence all businesses related to china ?
please check the noticeboard
if you have a conscience you ' ll feel bad
are you telling me to take responsibility ?
that ' s not it
i ' m checking who ' s at fault from the company ' s viewpoint
i ' m telling you its position regarding customs
mr oh
it ' s not your fault
time will solve everything stop drinking
no keep drinking today here
mr choi fell into his own trap
no one ' s at fault
times have changed so how can he not ?
right ?
he hasn ' t changed
neither have i
shall i make you a boilermaker ?
i ' ll make it for you
when boilermakers and
sales team 3 get together
that ' s it a success
mr oh said it ' s a must for sales
here
i ' ll feed you suk yool
drink it my arms hurt
there you go
it ' s ok
here
tissue tissue
it wasn ' t intentional it ' s good
it ' s ok
let go i have to wipe this off
you don ' t have to
oh gosh
i ' m home
why are you so late ?
you drank again ?
you know about drinking ?
i know better than you
you need a snack ?
you must need one after drinking so much
yeah ramen !
with some green onion yeah !
ramen at midnight ?
that ' s all we have
get up and eat this
your dad used to cook his
own ramen after drinking
i ' m cooking it for you when
i never cooked it for my honey
bon appetit
mr choi
hi there
it ' s really cold isn ' t it ?
yes
how are you ?
good
how about you ?
i ' m doing better than expected
i worked for that company for 28 years and i was shocked when
they had an issue with my ways
they say an executive is someone
who can see the stars on clouds
when everyone is looking at the ground
i thought it was ok to jump above
the ground to get on the clouds
how many people could possibly see the
stars with their feet on the ground ?
but i learned my lesson
nevertheless
the type of executive the company wants
is a giant who can see the stars
with their feet
on the ground
when i first met you mr choi
i was sure you ' d be like that
yeah ? yes
i thought you were amazing
i wanted to become like you
thanks for not bringing up other
issues during the auditing process
i wanted to tell you that
are you talking about the doubts regarding the rebate ?
they weren ' t doubts
they ' re your groundless suspicions
yes
that ' s why i couldn ' t bring it up
it wasn ' t for your sake
i just didn ' t have hard evidence though i had suspicions
just like with lee eun ji
i ' m glad you ' re still working
it ' s hard to see results in the global service business
but performance is key
but things will be tougher for you
since you affected china that way
it won ' t be easy for you to
work in one international
is that so ?
i don’t understand
that ' s right
mr choi was right
we tried to work as usual
but the company ' s atmosphere was still disturbed
hi where ' s mr kim ?
he ' s in a meeting
can i see the items '  chart for sudan ?
mr kim said he needs to give approval for everything
what ?
he told us not to show our data to anyone when he ' s away
give me the data
hey buddy !
our team worked on it too !
why can ' t i see it ?
i ' m sorry i ' ll take care of it after i tell mr kim
let me see the data
mr kim it ' s so hard to see a simple chart
what ?
you want me to go up there again ?
send it by messenger
what are you trying to do now ?
i get it
oh !
is something wrong ?
it ' s weird
what ' s wrong ?
about the import from laos
the finance manager has approved it too
but the chief of the headquarters hasn ' t yet
it was turned down
this is too much
totally
dang
your team isn ' t even working on any businesses now
sales team 3 oh sang sik speaking
apparently there has never been so
many complaints from china before
the business team doesn ' t know
how to take care of it now
i ' m sorry to say this
but all the businesses you were involved with before
and all those related to sales team 3
are being rejected
the losses for other teams are increasing
are you saying we should
take responsibility ?
not necessarily
still personal responsibility …
anyway chinese companies are saying
they can ' t work with one international
since connections can be an issue
so each team had to persuade them
it wasn ' t the company ' s position
but an arbitrary individual opinion
but things aren ' t looking good
so i think we need to make
a gesture that we fired you
but we couldn’t fire an employee
that wasn’t even punished
so the company is saying i have
to leave for china to calm down
that ' s not true
no
you know how they ' re treating our team
i ' ll have to leave
for our team to survive
the company will obviously want the fastest easiest way
but that ' s not the best way
we can find the right way
so wait till …
then what ?
what if all dies while waiting ?
mr oh
so you ' ll hand in your resignation or something ?
resignation …
yeah resignation
mr oh
it ' s ok
it ' s not like they can ' t run without me
all of us employees are ready to submit it
we always dream of submitting it every night
and go to work with it in our pockets
i ' ve been preparing myself mentally
but …
but …
i ' m just worried about that kid
go to bed it ' s late
you won ' t get much sleep before work tomorrow
can i
quit work ?
no you can ' t
right ?
are you quitting or getting fired ?
i ' m quitting
myself
ok
but you remember we have three kids right ?
what ?
receive your bonus before you quit
what ?
fridge
tv
two computers
what are you doing ?
things to buy before you quit
you get an employees '  discount
i hate you
oh hi young yi !
mr oh you ' re early today
yeah for a change
you ' re looking good
your team must be treating you well
yes there are no problems
yeah the one who enjoys it wins !
hello mr oh
good morning
i was so focused on a bad boss that i couldn ' t think about your team
i ' ll serve you better mr oh !

i couldn ' t take
responsibility for you till the end
i ' m sorry
thanks for everything
mr oh

i ' m sorry
hang in there
i ' m sorry

yours dropped a file !
mailbox or message box …
what ' s the definition ?

geu rae
what are you doing here ?
hello mr oh
first merry christmas
who are you to say my judgment …  ! you ' re trying to save me
you ' re
trying to make me a full-timer
isn ' t that why
you ' re working with people who you normally never would ?
mr oh
oh i ' m so sorry
sorry
i ' m so sorry
just because you can ' t see the road doesn ' t mean it ' s not a road
anything should be done
i ' m just asking you for a fair evaluation not special treatment
but it ' s not a solution
let ' s do it
geu rae

april is the cruelest month breeding
lilacs out of the dead land mixing
memory and desire stirring
dull roots with spring rain

if you ' re itchy go to a sauna

d ?  ? vu ?
oh mr ma and mr oh ' s conflict ?
i ' ll get going
i need to finish organizing the receipts
go ahead ok
the contract due date is approaching and there ' s no solution
mr kim and mr chun are doing their best but they can only do so much
and they can ' t do anything about it
but ms sun is doing her best
i want to do anything i can to help
is the myanmar case bidding complete ?
no sir
myanmar is special so i went with the original company
you guys just proceed without approval ?
sir
this is how we worked up till now
this is how  " we "  worked ?
and how is that ?
you guys have your own way
so just shut up and go with it ?
no sir i mean ?
just go with what i say
must i explain and convince you each time ?
coffee please yes
i ' ve been watching you guys
so you want to argue about everything ?
are you taking this seriously ?
you know ?
don ' t explain things to me
tell me through the papers
make calls brief without explanations
what ' s there to repeat over and over
again when files were already given ?
i ' m sorry i ' m sorry
aren ' t you tired of blabbering at the end of a day ?
give me the coffee
yes sir
i ' ll do my best to find a
proper new employee next time
i ' ll find one with good specifications
so work hard until then
get to work
i asked you for a lot of water
i asked you for so much water it seems too watery
i ' m sorry i ' ll get you another cup
forget it
hey
what happened to the chungsol payment ?
the items came over ages ago !
you want to be sued ?
many documents are missing including a quality guarantee
they said they ' d send it
then they will !
even if i input payment in the erp
you think they ' d take responsibility for the missing files after that ?
if an issue arises because of that
i ' d have to take responsibility
responsibility ?
you love responsibility don ? t you ?
how on earth were you raised at home ?
you trust no one and you ' re a selfish mess
why do you go crazy over the chungsol case ?
raised at home go crazy ?
take care of the payment asap ok ?
asap !
i can ' t even look at this dirty one
they should take care of those who are here
our steel team will start an additional
business with discarded fridges
and electronics related to
resource ' s urban energy business
i wish file transitions would be finished soon
mr yoo and ms ahn will help as much as they can
fiber will take care of the asbestos
if resource gives us the files on asbestos
we ' ll develop a malaysia
export case through samgang
geez why does everyone
want resource ' s business ?
a tf or transition every
time things get exciting
mr jung yes
how are you doing work ?
i ' m sorry
we were on the\m ghana fast internet line
installment case with sales team 1
since we ' re receiving the payment through mineral resources
i ' d like resource to take care of it
so why receive the payment through mineral resources ?
bartering is from the stone age
right mr jung ?
oh right
but apparently large inspection teams have come for french consultative groups
regarding ghana resource development investments
international projects to secure
ghana energy develop ?  lop
develop what ?
what are you trying to develop ?
what ?
what ?
i think it ' s a good opportunity for related businesses sir
yes
we ' ll research about the consumers and demands
why should your team do that ?
we can do that right mr jung ?
what ?
then go ahead
i wish you could do it by tomorrow
ms ?  ms sun
alright
i have another meeting to go into so let ' s end it here
wrap up individually too
yes it ' s true that there ' s a price drop in raw materials as
with the end of the super cycle
but the market of canadian chromium nickel and platinum is still large
you can read from the data that there will be
a variety of synergy effects among this consortium
so the schedule will be ?
i ' m sorry i ' ll send you the detailed schedule by email as soon as possible
ok thank you
why couldn ' t i even say  " development ?  "
is it over ? yeah
this is pitiful
ever since mr jung attacked him mr ma doesn ' t care about us
what if we end up sitting next to the restroom ?
be quiet let ' s just hope we don ' t
i hope our luck gets better
when will that happen ?
the day you retire ?
mr yoo you still haven ' t gone to london ?
i wish dept heads were contract employees
young yi
geu rae is leaving soon right ?
yes
mr kim will suffer the most after he does
yeah you have to train interns and newbies
that ' s if geu rae ' s successor comes
right their team rarely had newbies
but he really can ' t sign another contract right ?
why would the company sign him on as a full-timer ?
ms sun and the team seemed to be making efforts
but it won ' t produce any results
i ' m sure they know too
i thought i ' d just have to do my
share despite who became my partner
but i preferred someone
i could communicate with
i just wanted to tell you
i didn ' t have the ulterior
motives you ' re thinking of
i ' m sorry
no apologize after getting the job
young yi
i ' m sorry
congratulations
thank you
it ' s sad isn ' t it ?
the four of you started work together
is there really no solution ?
that ' s all i think about these days
there isn ' t
maybe you can start a movement
movement ?
the more the better you know
the company can reconsider
it if many people think about
though it ' s not a solution
start a movement ?
mr ha meant we should try to make
the company understand geu rae
that he ' s worth keeping and he has to stay
how ?
yeah we can ' t have a presentation for him
or put up posters like in college
we can ' t go to upper management like in the dramas
why not ?
we can go talk convince and cry out loud
this is like the last resort
they ruin someone ' s life instantaneously
why ' s it so hard to see the real of a person ?
where are you going ?
i have to do something
i ' ll try the method that made me fool once
i ' ll get going
i think there ' s something i can do
what ?
hi young yi
ms sun
i have a favor
i ' m fabric team 1 han suk yool
it ' s been nearly two years since i ' ve started working here
i had contacted you before because of an unpleasant issue
i ' d like to apologize first
the reason i ' m apologizing first
is so people won ' t close the window
just by the mention of my name
i ' d like to ask an
important favor today
two year contract employee jang geu rae has started work with me
and he ' s working in sales team 3
i hope he can become a full-timer
you can ' t ignore jang geu rae ' s performance
well i know
the interns were always complaining he started through
connections and special treatment
that ' s not necessarily true
we ' d like a fair evaluation
not special treatment
he passed the presentation interview with me two years ago
he joined sales team 3
he was the first of us to be in a
presentation with upper management
that radical presentation brought the
jordan used car business to success
we owe it to jang geu rae
connections
yes people called him the ged
jang geu rae who used his connections to get the job
so when we all entered as a full-timer
he joined as a two year contract employee
he had to suffer various insults since his intern days
but he worked harder than anyone else
thinking of one international as our company
is that for geu rae ?
yes
i ' m hoping it would help
i ' ll make files proving his performance for our team
yeah such portfolios are necessary for full-timer transition evaluations
i ' ll take a look when you ' re done
yes sir
he ' d come to work with us
and leave after we do
he worked so hard to make up
for his lacking experiences
when the item he planned he was excluded
because he was a contract employee
he gave up on it without a complaint
please change it
i ' ve
never been so embarrassed of my specifications before
i feel that way too
how can specifications make someone ' s
treatment so different from another ?
why should one ' s effort be
treated differently from others ?
that must be reflected in regulations
but transition to a full-timer is impossible
yes you ' re right
but i ' m just asking you that he won ' t be evaluated unfairly
in a standard evaluation
due to mr choi ' s incident
please sir
the basics are key to evaluate one ' s adaptability to work life
though it was hard to prove
his basics at the starting point
he has shown enough potential during the last two years
jang geu rae must become a full-timer
he said
" i ' ll sell this fabric with you suk yool "
please help me keep that promise
i ' ve had my shameful moments
but i ' d like to keep that promise
please
please check the payment regarding the malaysia contact lenses
yes the proposal review is complete it ' s doubled because of the stock
i ' d appreciate a prompt reply
each team can send one employee for
college graduate intern selections
wow new interns after two years
yeah
it ' s like geu rae came yesterday
nice to have a successor isn ' t it ?
show them as the senior
go
yes i ' ll be back
i ' ll be back go
let ' s have a talk
what kind of possibility ?
headquarters will send guidelines to the company soon
competent contract employees will be
transitioned to full-time positions
it ' s an opinion among upper management
so we will go by those guidelines too
trends are changing
please help out mr chun and mr kim
i ' ll do my best too
first of all make a file of all
of geu rae ' s performance results
yes sure
yes !
hey hey !
let ' s do it geu rae
can i
be ambitious again ?
i ' m back

yeah ?
about geu rae

smooth from the various circumstances

thanks
keep working hard

tomorrow

thanks
bye

hello ?
see you three hours later in petra
what ? why petra ?
two roads diverged in a yellow wood
and sorry i could not travel both
and be one traveler long i stood
and looked down one as far as i could
to where it bent in the undergrowth;
then took the other as just as fair
and having perhaps the better claim
because it was grassy and wanted wear;
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same
and both that morning equally
leaves no step had trodden black
oh i kept the first for another day !
yet knowing how way leads on to way
i doubted if i should ever come back
i shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence:
two roads diverged in a wood and i ?
i took the one less traveled by
and that has made all the difference
alcatraz
pharaoh ' s treasure
the gateway to petra
it ' s a path you have to pass by
it was the central trade route in the ancient times connecting
the persian bay to the east red sea to the south
and mediterranean to the west
incense road ?
come to think of it
my dream as an 18-year-old
was to travel around the world
as i watched indiana jones 3
i became determined
indiana jones 3 ?
mm-hmm
i had forgotten about it
but jordan reminded me
of my dream
dream ?
as commerce decreased
petra was forgotten for over 1000 years
i see
so i was thinking
just because you forgot your dream
doesn ' t make your dream vanish
just because you can ' t see the
road doesn ' t make the road vanish
lu xun said this
? hope can ' t be said it exists
nor can it be said it ' s not exist
it is just like roads across the earth
for actually the earth had no roads to begin with
but when many men pass one way a road is made ?
i see
uh mr oh
yeah ?
why did you want to meet here ?
i just told you
what ?
when ?
just now
what ?
i just told you
what ?
i should ' ve brought young yi

sponsoring for a few years
already 70% ?
then that ' s a mafia ' s company
mr suh
mr oh told me to tell you something
what ' s that ?
in russia the fist is more influential than the law

let ' s wrap up
the fist is more influential than the law

then there won ' t be any problems
geu rae amman airport
in a locker at amman airport
no 20 i ' m sorry
i ' m really sorry
please let me go
geu rae you ' re a true one international employee
who did you call a one international employee ?
why is he a one international employee ?
it ' s just an analogy
he worked so hard so that one international wouldn ' t suffer a loss
you mean our company not one international !
that ' s the same thing
one international ' s loss is your loss and your loss ?
be quiet !
don ' t you know our motto ?
you can steal our business but not our people
i heard it ' s your bad luck
dong sik ?
you ' re bad
i ' m not bad
geu rae yes
why didn ' t you say anything when he called you a one international employee ?
what ?
you still miss it ?
no
before you said you only needed some insurance and gosh ?
now that a year has gone by
you want more pay and benefits right ?
i know please increase my pay
what ?
you really miss one international ?
i don ? t know
why you ?
captivate me sir
what ?
just captivate me
what do you have that you can sell ?
what do you have that you can sell ?
my effort
i ' ve never used my effort
so it ' s like brand new
brand new ?
i ' ll work hard
i ' ll do whatever it takes
drive man
i had an accident don ' t hit me
a road opens
as you tread along it
a road that doesn ' t
open isn ' t a road
roads are open to everyone
but not everyone can have the roads
this isn ' t the army for you to get proficiency pay
you told me to catch me
i risked my life and caught him
this is wrong
another road has opened
and i ' m not alone
