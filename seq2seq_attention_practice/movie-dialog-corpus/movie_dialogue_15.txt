unidentified flying objects
then this is a flying saucer ?
they are so remote cold beautiful the stars but now i wonder
yes ?
which is the one we have to worry about ?
we are stuck tight !
skipper ! look at the depth gauge !
you ve got to let us try skipper
us ?
reef and i can take the explorer down clamp it around the eye and
you all wait here i am going inside take a look
not u alone u you are not !
yeah ?
listen ! hear that ?
hey you know somethin ? it s getting lighter in here !
you know it u is u ?
you hear that ?
the sound again ?
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from ?
somewhere down there ?
wonder where powell and carney are ?
we will have to look for them later
well ?
i am with u you ! u
here keep these it wants me to come alone
oh it does ? ? ?
dave !
what s goin on in here lad ? what ?
get ready we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard
right skipper
is there any way out of it ?
seems to be all around
what about down ?
i don t know !
course and speed ?
speed about twenty two knots course due north !
what course skipper ?
right at our one eyed friend !
you better take powell and carney with you
the frogmen ?
with their underwater experience they will be invaluable take sidearms and flare pistols
sidearms ? but the saucer s dead
we hope !
excuse me skipper
yes griff ?
all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor
skipper could you take a look here ?
something wrong ?
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
why do you say that ?
we are dead in the water but it indicates we are moving !
what ? ? ? ?
now they feel it down below
radiation level constantly rising
it doesn t seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center ?
under u water u ?
high intensity arcs will burn submerged and millions of volts discharged in random directions
the radiation level from the saucer it s rising !
what direction does the system indicate ?
as we near the pole
there s got to be an explanation !
there is i believe our friend cyclops is returning to life !
all ready ?
as ready as we u can u be ! i will report to the skipper
doctor neilsen ? when did u that u happen ?
huh ?
it will be all right we are old friends !
what do you think ?
i think i should have joined the air force !
determine extent of damage immediately
after torpedo room report !
you are sure it s cyclops ?
take a look
what s the running time ?
thirty four seconds !
right u at u him ?
that s what i said !
but what can we accomplish ?
we can u ram u him !
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots !
nothing we can do now
what s the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole ?
minus three
remove your weapons commander and come here alone !
come where ?
swell !
your friend was to remain where he was !
he did !
i am afraid not therefore
it is a living thing when damaged you would say wounded it immediately heals itself
that s why no water leaked inside when we rammed you ?
of course but it is time to be gin the return voyage
to navigate won t you have to see your way ?
obviously
u that u might be a u little u u rough u !
my yeoman will show you to your quarters
thank you
well i will be !
i will be another !
we ve asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times
but u answers u are what we need not more questions !
due north at five knots no six !
toward the pole !
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks

coffee ?

you know our two most senior senators gaius cantus and falco verus ?
only from a distance
it s my brother s neck you want not mine
yours will do !
you cannot die
would that marcus had lived
marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son
he killed his father and then my family
narcissus i have your family they are alive all of them
i made the plume from a quail feather
much more colorful than the ones we wear and of course less dented
i see the emperor s little boy has finally caught up with the army
let s hope he doesn t start giving orders

herb wants to see me ?
when you have a moment
so miles if you have a proposal let s hear it
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation
my client has ruled that out
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice
that s delusional
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order
ha ha
heh heh
so much for the icebreakers what are you after ruth ?
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets
why only fifty percent ruth ? why not ask for a hundred percent ?
oh brother here we go
why not a hundred and fifty percent ?
yes maybe you are right miles maybe we are being too conservative seventy five percent

please let me handle this okay ruth forget kirshner what s your bottom line ?
i think that went as well as could be expected
she always looked out for me
and she had private investigators assisting her
she brought my digestive enzymes
in anticipation of making you sick
maybe i should reconsider my
wait he wants to give her ?
nothing
and she has ?
video
what the fuck ?
wrigley !

you ve made your point ! you ve got control of the system
system s running on auxiliary only seven hours before it crashes
true
you are in there everybody dies you go with them
but don t you remember ? i am already dead
it s okay
okay
it s all been transferred
why ?
to live forever
she said i have a son
no she said she had a son in a dream she once called life

why
because there will be no remorse not in my world
as long as it s not what s your sign ?
if you could meet god what would you say to him ?
that s a strange question you a strange man ?
there you are sitting next to the creator what do you say ?

what s happening ?
nothing go back to sleep

the patterns were moved around but they weren t changed
true but why ?
but what would happen to me ? i have no body to return to
not my problem
so wrong
divinity ?
yes
you are not a god
in here i am
god creates man man creates technology technology creates god end into beginning
in a computer program
the new world
it s not real
not real ?
you were the one who was dying
yes
you sealed off the system when it crashes everyone dies with you
yes but only in the dream they call life
dream ? !
and all dreams no matter how appealing must eventually end
unlimited energy out there enough to run this world for all eternity
but you will never be able to get it through the maze
me ? of course not that s why you are here
but once the system touches the net all links are severed everybody dies
only up there in the dream they called life
and down here
remember i am not the one who chose this
yes so which one of us does that make the coward ?
where the hell are you going ?
unfinished business
and what about the reconfiguration ?
perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth

but have them wait for me till they move in on him
won t be time if he gets access
he won t
he had access to the keys
yes
we can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system

the only way to eject it is from the inside

no you won t
you d best take a swim jack
the last time you do this you left me a pistol with one shot
so how did you get off that island anyway ?
you can go to your grave not knowing
that s fair
no i really think i do
all right then
you ve no hope of surviving norrington s attack that is if you are mortal
what are you suggesting ?
now you can take care of the dauntless right ?
men ! are you up for it ?
there s another exit ?
aye for us there is

my apologies miss as you were saying before you were so rudely interrupted ?
captain barbossa i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal
i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request means no
very well
you have a name missy ?
elizabeth turner i am a maid in the governor s household
maid or not it fits you
dare i ask the fate of it previous owner ?
now none of that please dig in
oh there would be no sense in killing you miss turner
then why aren t you eating ?
would that i could
do you not know what this is then ?
it s a pirate medallion
it s a piece of the treasure of isla de muerta
agreed you have my word as a gentleman of fortune

man overboard !
boy overboard !
fetch a hook haul him out of there !
did he speak ?
his name is will turner that s all i found out
very good
commodore i must protest pirate or not this man saved my life
one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness
elizabeth i hereby withdraw my proposal
what ?
i know where your heart truly lies
elizabeth ? is everything all right ? are you decent ?
yes yes
it s beautiful may i inquire as to the occasion ?
is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts ?
although i did think you could wear it to the ceremony today
ceremony ?
captain norrington s promotion ceremony
difficult to say
i am told that dress is the very latest fashion in london
women in london must have learned to not breathe
elizabeth this is hardly appropriate
about the day we met do you remember ?
i could never forget it miss swann
will how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth ?
at least once more miss swann as always
i am glad we got here in time
truthfully you were a bit late
i can t believe he would make such a sacrifice for us
i guess you can never truly know someone else s heart
there and don t you dare tell me that wasn t a proper kiss !
elizabeth i think it doesn t matter that we are of a different class
it doesn t !
but that was not a proper kiss
miss swann
miss swann if you will be so kind ?
you are despicable
i saved your life now you ve saved mine we are square
you ? !
me !
you are in league with barbossa !
no i am rescuing you
come on !
no this won t work i will stay behind and fight them you go on
has it changed since the last time you were here ?
the trees are taller
captain sparrow ! we have to get off this island immediately !
don t be thinking i am not already working on it
that was before i met one of course
now i must hear this song an authentic pirate song have at it
well perhaps with a bit more to drink i might
more to drink !
to freedom
to the black pearl
what are you doing ? you ve burned our food the shade the rum !
yes the rum is gone
kid s a bit of a stick isn t he ?
that he is
we d best drop canvas sir !
she can hold a bit longer
what s in your head to put you in such a fine mood ?
we are catching up !
how did you get off the island ?
ah that s a dark and unpleasant tale best left untold
blast it i am already awake !
i know that was for the smell
we can at least fight we might be able to kill a few
will it will go worse for us for elizabeth especially if we fight
all the men in place sir ready to fire
wait for my order what the blazes is that ?
sir ! shall i break out the cannons ?
i don t think that will be necessary
this dock is off limits to civilians
sorry i didn t know
what s your name ?
smith
well well jack sparrow isn t it ?
captain jack sparrow if you please
but it seems to be enough to condemn him
indeed
we had time to get to know each other
we are bound for port royal not isla de muerta
do you think this is wise boy ? crossing blades with a pirate ?
you threatened miss swann
only a little
you cheated
pirate
move away
no
move !
no i can not just step aside and let you escape
agreed
agreed !
not without my effects
we need to go !
this is either crazy or brilliant
remarkable how often those two traits coincide
everybody stay calm we are taking over the ship !
aye ! avast !
tortuga ?
oh did i forget to mention that ?
just do it quickly
don t worry i ve already got a quartermaster there !
shut up before you lose them all !
these are the only ones worth having and we are going to need them
miss swann ! we are here to rescue you ! it s going badly !
this way !
no
i will lead them away
do you have any idea where you are going ?
jack !
don t talk these caves magnify sound just follow me
are you certain this is the right way ?
it s the right way
what s your business in port royal am r smith ?
and no lies !
i think he s telling the truth
he s not telling the truth
he may be
if he were telling truth he wouldn t have told us
that jack sparrow he talked about the black pearl
mentioned it is more what he did
still
he s still breathing
where did he come from ?
what happened here ?
an explosion in the powder magazine merchant vessels run heavily armed
has my daughter given you an answer yet ?
no she hasn t
well she had a very taxing day ghastly weather tonight
bleak very bleak
commodore
a moment
but
please
dammit man it appears someone is stealing your ship !
how long do you leave him in there ?
until he s done
wheelchair accessible
dr argon i demand an explanation
you can t mean that
come with me susan i want to show you something
something to drink dr bright ?
no thank you
you will forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched poppy ?
we will always love most that which we create don t you agree susan ?
does that mean oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb ?
what are you going to do to him ?
do ? well i suppose that depends on you
what did you use ?
a light mixture of oxygen dioxide and sodium pentothal he will sleep that s all
i should kill you right now for what you did to me !
maybe you should but you can t
how apropos
ain t it
i know what you are doing
you mean besides kicking your ass ? !
you think you can use me to stop the meltdown
like rotting meat
you are not rotting meat
oh no ? smell this
icarus please if you want me to give you a bath just say so
no i am getting used to it
icky ! what s happening ?
who cares ! we ve got to find him ! hurry !
gently ott gently
dr nebbleman i want to know the moment the nanobot arrives the instant understand ?
do you think she will give us the designs ?
eventually these things are always a matter of leverage
and you think o brien is that leverage ?
that remains to be seen
and you still believe he s going to come here ?
based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable
do you think she loves him ?
she must feel something for him after all she and i did create him
poppy are you in one of your moods again ?
no icky this is real
icarus ?
i promise my dear i will give the matter some consideration
consideration ?
if you honestly trust me then you will have to trust me
it will be an ascension
i am so excited icarus
i was wondering if you d finished considering ?
considering what ?
what i asked you earlier ?
poppy please
if you loved me like i loved you ?
poppy this is not the time !
did you feel that ?
did i ? i ve been waiting for that for years
not that
she could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys
dr nebbleman take care of them
where did he go ?
the trunk
they are here ! they are here ! we have the nanobot
excellent how long until the assembler tank is complete ?
dr makeo is working on it now sir i estimate at least another six hours
in the meantime why don t you find something useful for dr bright to do
excellent work dr nebbleman you have outdone yourself
thank you sir
hey !
you don t want this
yeah i do !
you have no idea what this is doing to your body
i like trix !
here kid this is great stuff why don t you give it a try ?
i want trix ! mommy !
do you remember about five years ago that uh incident at purnell labs ?
oh yeah they were working on molecular assemblers too weren t they ?
they also tried using viral r n a as the bonding element
that s right c d c found out and closed them down
what did security say ?
they will in validate the key probably nothing
well you got another problem
the replicators ?
worse mrs argon wants to talk to you she s waiting in the lab
this day just keeps going from bad to worse
you were never invited to my house
you are looking for a urine sample
i don t believe this is happening
susan dr argon is giving you an opportunity here
opportunity ?
yes ?
it s sim we are almost there
mr sim watch out ! o brien escaped and could be on his way !
what s it smell like ?
smell ? uh something like methylcyanoacrylate
like crazy glue ?
yes that s it he s got it oh god he s got it !
sir please try to hold still
so i guess it worked
susan !
wellie well dr bright you are just in time
daniel
what ? no kiss ? not even for old times sake ?
when did you ?
been out for six months now
really ? what have you been doing ?
you know this and that
nothing really worthwhile
that s what i thought
daniel give him the trix
susan this is the future of america here
susie ! you gotta help me !
daniel what are you doing here ?
please susan ! i need help ! something is wrong with me !
sorry daniel i am a physicist not a psychiatrist
no something is really wrong look !
they did it to me !
the nanobot
just like the mouse
mouse ? what mouse ?
my first organic polymerization was a lab mouse
what happened to it ?
i don t know
you don t know ?
it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment
but you ve polymerized single celled bacteria and the fruit flies i know you have
yes
then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure
pills you know how i feel about pills
if you don t want to do it this way i can remove it surgically
why do we need it ?
the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste
what waste ?
the replicators start off like assemblers but the replicators never stabilize
what happens ?
that was an egg ?
three days ago it was
what do these replicators do to people ?
with enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else
so right now there s little replicators spreading throughout argon s lab ?
that s right
isn t it already too late then ?
i think while we are waiting we had better run some basic diagnostics on you
you are the doctor
is something wrong ?
no no i just feel wired !
susan !
what ? what s wrong ?
look at this !
what about it !
just look at it !
the polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl cyanoacrylate so what s wrong ?
just like old times
yeah old times
i want you to know that i really appreciate you helping me
i am glad you came to me for help
i feel very emotional right now a bit out of control
probably the caffeine
do you have something to bring me down ?
no problem
uh oh i remember that temper
daniel i didn t hear you come down
what s wrong ?
the nanobot it s not here
it s still inside me ?
how far can you stretch ?
i don t know
that s pretty good
getting used to it
did you go ?
on the counter
who is he ?
the head shrinker at the prison
run daniel ! get out of here !
i am not leaving without you susan !
you saved my life
did you think i could just leave you ?
what in the ?
oh shit the meltdown it s spread to the tower
we ve got to get the nanobot
it s too late argon injected it
you mean he s polymerized like me ?
that means the nanobot is still inside him
yes
what would happen if i threw him into the core ?
the same thing i suppose
you are not going after argon !
i have to !
do the words hero fantasies mean anything to you ? how about infantile dementia ?
things do change
i guess they do
only this ain t no tranquilizer gun now let s go !
forget it pissboy ! you tell argon he can call my lawyer
all the different ways that i could kill you
oh yeah ?
maybe you are ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof ?
the question is are you ?
that s impossible
it s a miracle
mrs argon ? it s sim
mr sim ? do you have him ? he s alive ?
oh yeah he s alive technically
and you have him ?
we lost him
vermin
can i help you mrs argon ?
i could have you fired right now
you won t that s why you are whispering
icky !
get him daniel ! knock his block off !
okay barbie let s get this over with

so i will meet you at the restaraunt ?
ok
and the listless ones do the binding
it s remarkable doctor the patients are so subdued so docile
they ve the satisfaction only a hard day s labor can provide
to seal the wound he took a poker from the fire
a poker he took a poker from the fire
then how can we know who is truly good and who is evil ?
we can t all we can do is guard against our own corruption
has he hurt you ?
his stinking breath caused my eyes to run that s all
in part yes
he s not the man who s cast a shadow here
charenton has changed it s not safe for you here
i ve you to look after me haven t i ?
don t turn us out abbe
turn you out ?
go back to your room quickly
what ? what ve i done ?
don t come back not tonight not again
you will hate me now won t you ?
free his mouth
mustn t do that sir
i must grant him his last rites
i don t take my orders from you not anymore
you d deny a dying man his salvation ?
care for a splash of wine abbe ?
it s not even noon
conversation like certain portions of the anatomy always runs more smoothly when it s lubricated
you ve a touch of the poet too perhaps you should take up the quill
do i have your word ?
you mean to take us all down with you ?
don t be absurd it s only a play
i will die of loneliness ! i ve no company but the characters i create
whores and pederasts ? you are better off without them
virgin birth ha ! an entire religion built on an oxymoron !
orvolle his wine from now on nothing but water at every meal
water !
and your meat shall be de boned
why this sudden torture ?
because your writing continues unchecked
off with your clothes !
coulmier you animal !
i do not mean to flirt marquis !
oh but you must my pumpkin ! sex without flirtation is merely rape !
now strip
it s a potent aphrodisiac isn t it ? power over another man
your wig remove your wig
it s no secret that you loved her
oh that s rich coming from her lapdog
i saw the longing in your eye
that was lust
the passion in your heart
i dare you stab my flesh which one of us will bleed ?
tomorrow we will cut out your tongue
abbe de coulmier !
i am here
surely you will grant me a final word
of course
i understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction
a few indiscretions in his youth
why is he in your care and not a proper prison ?
his wife s influence
his wife s ?
better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one
oh that
well ?
it s essential to his recovery a purgative for the toxins in his mind
do you favor its publication ?
for sale ? to the general public ? certainly not it s unprintable
on the contrary let me take up this matter with the marquis myself
and place my reputation at stake ?
charenton is my life s work to have her wrested from beneath me now
well ?
i spoke to him with reason and compassion the tools which serve us best here
and ?
he s sworn to obedience
he s more than a patient doctor the marquis is my friend
you keep strange company abbe but if you truly have matters in hand here
i have
then i ve friends of my own to visit
madame bougival mademoiselle clairwil and of course the marquis wife
oh indeed ?
it was fiction of course
of course
it was not inspired by circumstance
no it most certainly was not
you will get more from her with kindness than you will with force
what could cause a tincture like this ?
if only blood will appease you then shed mine
you d suffer in her stead ?
perhaps you will be so kind as to remind me of her name
i beg you doctor don t make me say it
her name abbe
but here at the hotel dieu we favor an aggressive course of treatment
quite
i don t seek popularity or renown monsieur delben mine is a higher mission
charenton ? the administrator there is quite well loved is he not ?
i am afraid so he s an idealist you will have to be politic
do you know how i define idealism monsieur delben ?
you asked my name once it s madeleine
sweet then ? like the pastry ?
i am only a laundress not a detective
now s not the time to be cheeky maddy
i am hungry for a proper visit
don t start
go ahead you ve a key slip it through my tiny hole
the peril of composing such incendiary prose
i put myself at life and limb surely that s worth a few louis
a kiss for each page
must i administer them directly or might i blow them ?
the price my coquette is every bit as firm as i am
oh you you talk same as you write
it s a long story this one
the climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap
you demand a lot from your readers you do
the story s thrilling conclusion comes at a premium
what s that then ?
they ve taken your clothes ?
they decreed me a savage and now they have made me one
surely you ve seen a man naked
it s only been described to me in your books
i must say in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations
you are far crueler than i my sweet
it needn t be not if you ve another story
how do you propose i write it ? with dust upon the air ?
you could whisper it through the walls of your cell
it is customary to write first and request an appointment
desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy
my schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics
perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them
i am not a wealthy woman
but you ve a pension haven t you from the sale of his books ?
it s tainted money doctor
what a beautiful thought marquise
what thought is that ?
that ill gotten funds borne of his degeneracy might now effect his salvation
i am eternally in your debt
and i in yours
doctor can i impart to you his cruelest trick ?
of course
once long ago in the folly of youth he made me love him
hm ? tell me what other treats ?
shame on you truly
leave at once
but it s just begun
do as i say
ever met walter winchell ?
no when i was but a tender lad

orson please it s too bright
he will destroy us
then let him what have we got to lose you and i ?
so who is he ? we have to know him
everyone sees someone different that s what we show

readers digest april 1939
well i only quote from the best
i predicted it
how ?
stella in economics a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market absolutely none
it crashed didn t it ?
his personal effects he s probably running away the coward
sometimes it s worse to stay than it is to run
but it takes a particularly low type of man to do it
what about this morning ? any developments ?
no the shades are still drawn in their apartment
in this heat ? they are up now
a federal offense
get back there ! he will see you !
goodbye mr jefferies i will see you tomorrow
uh huh
i am just going to get the name of their truck !
i will watch the alleyway in case it goes that way
mrs thorwald ?
uh uh the dog i think i know now why thorwald killed it
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around ?
and digging in look at that flower bed
you shouldn t have let her do that ! if he ever
look !
thank heaven that s over !
i have a feeling we ve just begun
you know ? you might not be too bad a bargain for lisa after all
you don t say ! i might just take that compliment as an insult
what are you two talking about ?
got a shovel ?
no
there s probably one in the basement
now wait a minute
you know miss fremont he might just have something there
there s no point in taking unnecessary chances give me the phone book lisa
what s she trying to do ? why doesn t she turn him in ?
smart girl
smart ? she will be arrested !
that will get her out of there won t it ?
what do you need money for ?
to bail lisa out of jail
one hundred and twenty seven
how much do you think you will need ?
first offense burglary probably two fifty the piggy bank
ten here
thirty three here totals one ninety not enough
i got twenty or so in my purse give me what you ve got
what about the rest ?
when those cops get a look at miss fremont they will even contribute
hello
mrs doyle ?
yes
jeff again has tom come in yet ?
not yet jeff
you haven t even heard from him ?
not a word
how s your leg ?
mmmm hurts a little
and your stomach ?
empty as a football
and you love life ?
not too active
anything else bothering you ?
uh huh
the lisa fremont who never wears the same dress twice ?
only because it s expected of her
something big going on somewhere ?
going on right here it s a big night
it s just a run of the mill monday the calendar s loaded with them
what would you think of starting off with dinner at the 21 ?
you have perhaps an ambulance outside ?
big enough ?
fine corkscrew s on the right
you can t buy that kind of publicity
that s good news
someday you might want to open up your own studio here
how could i run it from say pakistan ?
jeff isn t it time you came home ? you could pick your assignment
i wish there was one i wanted
make the one you want
you mean leave the magazine ?
yes
for what ?
for yourself and me i could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow fashion portraits
well she picked the most prosperous looking one
she s not in love with him or any of them
how can you tell that from here ?
you said it resembled my apartment didn t you ?
oh some songwriter in the studio apartment lives alone probably had an unhappy marriage
i think it s enchanting
almost as if it were being written especially for us
no wonder he s having so much trouble with it
you don t think either one of us could ever change ?
right now it doesn t seem so
can t we just sort of keep things status quo ?
without any future ?
i am not exactly on the other side of the room
your mind is and when i want a man i want all of him
what do you think ?
something too frightful to utter
okay chief what s my next assignment
to get on home
all right but what s he doing now ?
i wonder where he s going now ?
i don t know
suppose he doesn t come back again ?
he will all his things are still piled on the bed
well i guess it s safe to put on some lights now
not yet !
something on your mind lisa ?
it doesn t make sense to me
what doesn t ?
women aren t that unpredictable
lisa i can t guess what you are thinking
we have all what ?
night i am going to stay with you
you will have to clear that through my landlord
i have the whole weekend off
well that s fine but i only have one bed and
say anything else and i will stay tomorrow night too
lisa i won t be able to give you any
i will trade you my feminine intuition for a bed for the night
i d be no better than thorwald to refuse
from his landlord once a month
it s utterly beautiful i wish i could be creative
you are you have a talent for creating difficult situations
i do ?
staying the night here uninvited
i hate funny exit lines
who was the trunk addressed to ?
did mr doyle think i stole this case
no lisa i don t think he did
i will rephrase the question
thank you
for a minute doyle almost had me convinced i was wrong
but you are not ?
in the whole courtyard only one person didn t come to the window
do you think this was worth waiting all day to see ?
is he cleaning house ?
he s washing down the bathroom walls
something s in there those flowers have been taken up and put back again
it could be the knife and the saw
wasn t that close ?
too close
what for ?
maybe i can get thorwald out of the apartment
get an ambulance don t move try to lie still
lisa i i can t tell you how scared i was that you you might
shut up i am all right
think you ve got enough for a search warrant now ?
steady marlon !

congratulations ! it s happy homes for harry and emily weiss of denton
infantile regression

i got it ! i got it ! ! !
introduce yourselves
i am janet majors and this is my husband brad
we ve been hearing some bad things about you brad
he needs help
i know i know it s just
looks like are st home for this marriage
i know he s boring but neuro specialists ! that sounds pretty drastic
it s no use pussyfooting around janet we have to cut quick and deep
sin i ful
little black dress
dear old bert s settled everything
jah you endorse his product he endorses your research
how did you come by this scenario ?
i am in farley s employ and we are discussing a network deal
why janet ?
everyone loves the girl next door particularly farley
so it seems
in my time they used to call me the merlin of berlin
they probably meant irving and wanted you to swing
we are the experts
who trusts experts ?
out of self comes selflessness
show yourself the real you the secret you
a free thinker
everything s free there
conspiracy is right the denton dossier is
closed ?
clever of you to find this spot betty
it pays to know your way around oliver
a stately pleasure home indeed
oh i adore coleridge taylor as a matter of fact
look look at that bert schnick can see why he s dancing
yes macabre isn t it the blind leading the blind
care to indulge ?
indulge ?
in a little masquerade ?
some people do it for enslavement
some people do it on the pavement
oh ah i am not calling at an inconvenient moment am i ?
not at all you have your life and i have mine
yeah well here betty i just came to give you this
i will leave you young things to it
shove it ralph !

that s us
i don t want to get up there
we ve got to brad everyone s watching
i am looking for love
i am looking for trade
some people do it for compassion
some people do it for the fashion
some people do it to be funny
some people do it for the money
some people do it for for each other
some people do it for for their lovers
some people do it for for improvement
some people do it for movement
some people do it for for enjoyment
some people do it for for employment
you will find a rambling rose and a picket fence
tenderness and innocence in denton
oh harry what are we going to do ?
well maybe i could wear my black leather brogues ?
too flashy they will clash with the new outfits
could i do that later ?
of course

brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you

the captain would make a much more valuable hostage
we will consider it a prisoner exchange
it s working
where is he ?
i thought he was the chief engineer
he is
then when is he going to engineering ?
target their bridge
full disruptors
actually captain your precise target area was thirty five meters that way
thanks for pointing that out
this is its current position
can you project its course ?
are any of them inhabited ?
veridian iii is uninhabited but veridian iv supports a pre industrial humanoid society
population ?
approximately two hundred thirty million
approximately forty seven minutes sir
i have to find a way to get to soran
but at the first sign of trouble i am going to deactivate it agreed ?
agreed
i get it i get it
you get what ?
i don t see a control panel or an access port
it appears to be a magnetically sealed
data this isn t the time
i am sorry but i cannot stop myself i think something is wrong
data are you all right ?
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays
we better get you back to the ship la forge to enterprise
that s it bridge we are all out !
one minute to warp core breach
sensors show five life signs aboard the station captain
the station complement was nineteen
looks like you are stuck with emotions for a while how do you feel ?
i am quite preoccupied with concern about geordi
we all are data but we are going to get him back
i hope so sir
i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters attempting to level our descent
all hands brace for impact !
we are within visual range of the energy distortion captain
on screen
we are within range sir
beam them directly to sickbay
deck 15 section 21 alpha
i will go you have the bridge
guinan what s going on ? where am i ?
you are in the nexus
this is the nexus ?
for you this is where you wanted to be
but i never had a wife children a home like this
enjoy them jean luc
i am captain john harriman i d like to welcome you all aboard
it s our pleasure
well may we have a look around ?
please please
excuse me gentlemen if you will take your seats
oh of course
what about the gravimetric distortions ? they will tear us apart
risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair
beautiful day isn t it ?
yes yes it is
this clock i gave this clock to bones
i am from what you would consider the future the 24th century
so you are telling me this is the 24th century and i am dead ?
not exactly as i said this is some kind of
temporal nexus yeah i heard you something s missing
no no it s not it s better
better ?
this is my uncle s barn in iowa
antonia ?
she s not real either is she ? nothing here is nothing here matters
captain of the enterprise huh ?
that s right
close to retirement ?
i hadn t planned on it
you know scotty it amazes me
and what would that be sir ?
sulu when did he find the time for a family ?
it s like you always said if something s important enough you make the time
their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space time continuum
phasing ? to where ?
the first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death scotty ?
there s just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude !
keep her together until i get back
i always do
kirk here
captain i don t know how much longer i can hold her together !
sir ?
make it so
there s still no indication of why they attacked the station ?
we think they were looking for something they practically tore the place apart
hmm inform starfleet command this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector
you want me to contact starfleet ?
is there a problem ?
no sir
thank you number one
report
a quantum implosion has occurred within the amargosa star all nuclearfusion is breaking down
how is that possible ?
that s a pretty big margin of error
too big how long until the ribbon arrives ?
captain are you all right ?
yes fine if you will excuse me
you felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line
my brother had shouldered that burden allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs
there s nothing selfish about pursuing your own life your own career
or perhaps they are on the surface
mr data scan the planet for lifeforms
doctor soran ?
yes yes captain thank you for coming
we are all mortal soran it s one of the truths of ou existence
what if i told you i found a new truth ?
the nexus
time has no meaning there the predator has no teeth
the royal studs ?
you see the top yardarm now look to the
it looks like we are too late
there are no other ships in the system
these blast patterns are consistent with type iii disruptors
well that narrows it to klingon breen or romulan
sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago
the star s going to collapse in a matter of minutes
they have found a way to penetrate our shields
lock phasers and return fire !
status !
all automates ready and functioning automatic moorings retracted all speeds available through transwarp drive
incredible machine helmsman one quarter impulse power
transwarp at your command sir !
execute !
what s going on ? when do we get paid off ?
soon captain quite soon
mr chekov ?
an energy reading from c deck from inside mr spock s quarters
mr chekov i ordered spock s quarters sealed !

shall i alert dr mccoy ?
yes he has a long journey ahead
calm yourself bones
sir commander starfleet on emergency channel he orders you to surrender this vessel
no reply chekov continue on course
excelsior closing to 4000 meters sir
mr scott we need everything you ve got now
admiral there is no response from the grissom on any channel
keep trying chekov at regular intervals
still no response sir
bones can you give me a quadrant bi scan ?
nothing on my scanner sir
short range scan mr chekov on screen mr sulu
sir the shields non responsive
scotty ?
aye sir coding now
dr marcus it s your planet
do you wish to advise starfleet sir ?
wait a minute ! we don t know what we are talking about here

locate
surge from astern sir aft quarter !
on screen
i don t believe it
what is it ?
all right get your gear i will put you down next time around
thank you u sir u !
same sector metallic mass
underground deposit ?
negative on surface a manufactured object
there s only one thing it could be short range scan
approximately two meters long cylindrical in form
a photon tube !
new orbit commencing coming up on sector three
short range scan
as before metallic mass verifying triminium photon tube no new data
check for trace radiation infrared enhancement
radiation residual level is minimal
spock s tube
david
what is it ?
spock s burial robe
later let s go
grissom your message acknowledged will advise out
this planet is aging in surges
and spock with it they are joined together
whoever they are they are getting closer
i will go
no ! i will do it give me your phaser
if equipment is functioning properly indications are an animal life form
you said there wouldn t be any
captain this is saavik come in please
yes saavik go ahead
ah saavik that s ah extroadinary what would you ah like to do next ?
request permission to beam aboard immediately
saavik does dr marcus think there could be any chance of ah radioactive contamination ?
none that i can detect sir
well all the same i am going to advise starfleet and get instructions
captain what s happening ? !
we are under attack ! stand by for evasive stand by for
mr scott ?
i d be grateful admiral if you d give the word
gentlemen may the wind be at our backs stations please !
steady steady all right mr scott
sir ?
the u doors u mr scott !
aye sir she s got her second wind now
scan for vessels in pursuit !
mr scott all power to the weapons systems
aye sir !
mr scott two photon torpedoes at the ready sight on the center of the mass
aye sir !
good shooting scotty
aye those two hits should stop a horse let alone a bird
precautionary mr chekov shields up
how many more ?
just him sir !
bones help spock ! everyone else find a station !
what happened ?
he gave his life to save us that is all i know
the genesis planet is gone
goodbye david
my god
much is at stake
i know you do i not ?
yes and i know you
my father says you have been my friend you came back for me
you would have done the same for me
why would you do this ?
because the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many
yes yes spock
the ship out of danger ?
you saved the ship spock you saved us all don t you remember ? !
on course admiral estimating spacedock in two point one hours
very well mr chekov i need pre approach scan take the science station please
admiral what s going to happen to enterprise ?
she s to be decommissioned
the word sir ?
the word is no i am therefore going anyway
count on our help sir
i will need it sulu
we have cleared spacedoors
full impulse power !
warp speed mr sulu
aye sir warp speed
excelsior the great experiment is adrift in space
mr scott as good as your word
estimating genesis 2 9 hours present speed
can we hold speed mr scott ?
we are secured from warp speed now entering genesis sector of mutara quadrant
what about grissom mr chekov ?
see ! that shimmering area
yes sir it s getting larger as we close in
that distortion is closing rapidly opinion sulu ?
i think it s an energy form sir
yes enough energy to hide a ship wouldn t you say ?
a cloaking device ?
red alert mr scott
klingon bird of prey sir ! she s arming torpedoes !
fire mr scott !
mr sulu what is the crew complement of a bird of prey ?
about a dozen officers and men

what about surface life signs ?
close there
come on !
if i read this right sir we have full power

david please
this is just to give us something to do isn t it ? come on
are you sure these are the coordinates ?
captain this is the garden spot of ceti alpha vi
i can hardly see
you are crazy !
i saw it !
there s an air lock
i told you ! i told you i saw a
ssssh !
u botany bay u oh no !
what s the matter ?
but the child
never mind ! hurry !
a criminal captain a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering
what do you want with us ? i demand
beyond what i told you sir it is classified information
umm and would admiral kirk have access to such information ?
i would think so sir he s on the fleet general staff
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis ?
to doctor marcus the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i
i see helmsman ?
well done commander
you realize sir that they will attempt to contact admiral kirk and confirm the order
where s dr marcus
i am doctor marcus !
why didn t you tell me ?
she s making it up ! my father was professor
it s a long story
we appear to have plenty of time
it s the genesis wave !
what ?
he s on a build up to detonation !
how soon
we encoded four minutes
we will beam aboard and stop it
you can t !
i don t mean to intrude
uh no i should be on the bridge
are you running away from me ?
i was wrong about you and u i am u sorry
is that what you came here to say ?
mainly and also that i am proud very proud to be your son
let go he can t !
only half of you would get there
what are you looking at ?
the admiral s son
don t you believe it
oh i believe it
what are u you u looking at ?
i don t know
sir our shields are dropping !
raise them
they won t
u where s the over ride u ? ?
well ?
warp drive still inoperative all other systems should be restored shortly
departing dark side regula
visual
we will lose them if they go in there
rake her
no sir ! we have genesis whatever you want
u full power damn you u !
tactical !
inoperative
raise the shields
yours is the superior
i shall avenge you
genesis what s that ?
don t play with me kirk my hand is on the phaser control
give me some time to recall the data on our computers
i give you sixty seconds admiral
time s up admiral
here it comes now spock
captain we are waiting what s the delay ?
all is well sir you have the coordinates to beam up genesis
first things first captain kill admiral kirk
scotty what s left ?
just the batteries sir i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes
we don t have minutes can you give me phaser power ?
a few shots sir
just barely sir
i am going down to the station
i will need ten minutes sir til the radiation dissipates
uhura send to commander reliant prepare to be boarded
uhura can t you augment ?
i am trying sir stand by
she s not responding
try the emergency channels
enterprise to reliant come in reliant
picture mr saavik
mr scott on discrete
scotty let s have it
on screen
admiral
do it while we have time
no response sir
sensors captain ?
saavik for god s sake tell her we are all right
i say again this is enterprise please acknowledge signal please
enterprise to reliant you are ordered to surrender your vessel respond ! nothing sir
we will beam aboard alert transporter room
mr scott you old space dog you are well ?
i had me a wee bout but dr mccoy pulled me through
oh ? a wee bout of what mr scott ?
no sir ! you will flood the whole compartment !
he will die !
if he hadn t we d be space by now
admiral this is spock
kirk to enterprise damage report spock ?
admiral if we go by the book like lieutenant saavik hours could seem like days
i read you captain let s have it
meaning you can t even beam us back ?
not at present
spock this is kirk it s two hours are you about ready ?
right on schedule admiral just give us your coordinates and we will beam you aboard
and who is this ?
midshipman first class peter preston engineers mate sir
your first training voyage mr preston ?
yes sir
i see well shall we start with the engine room ?
is the word given ?
the word is given warp speed
aye
hrummm and where are you off to now ?
the enterprise i must check in before your inspection and you ?
home
there s a first time for everything admiral
to be sure captain
carol marcus
yes
what s she doing here ?
chekov s on reliant isn t he ?
is it possible their comm system has failed ?
it would explain a great many things
they knew just where to hit us
who ? who knew just where to hit us ? and u why u ?
one thing is certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power
visual ! mr sulu divert everything to the phasers
too late
not enough against their shields
who the u hell u are they ?
the prefix code ?
it s all we ve got
what is working around here ?
not much admiral we have partial main power
that s it ?
best we could do in two hours
estimating nebula penetration in two minutes reliant is closing
steady as you go
admiral they are reducing speed
uhura patch me in
spock !
the ship out of danger ?
yes
the good of the few
or the one
uhura ! what s happening ? damn it
transmission jammed at the source sir
damn alert starfleet headquarters i want to talk with starfleet command
any suggestions admiral ?
prayer mr saavik the klingons do not take prisoners captain
lieutenant are you wearing your hair differently ?
it is still regulation admiral
may i speak sir ?
lieutenant self expression does not seem to be one of your problems
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
you earned it
i did not think so
you are bothered by your performance on the u kobayashi maru u
i failed to resolve the situation
there is no correct resolution it is a test of character
may i ask how u you u dealt with the test ?
you may ask lieutenant
that was a little joke
humor that is a difficult concept it is not logical
we learn by doing lieutenant
yes
take the test again
this is damned peculiar yellow alert
energize defense fields
khan !
who ?
reliant s command
hurry
indeterminate life signs
phasers on stun move out
that s true admiral all the memory cells have been emptied
erased
what s on your mind lieutenant ?
the u kobayashi maru u sir
regulation 46 a if transmissions are being monitored during battle
no uncoded messages on an open channel
that was close
they just don t want us going in there
hold your course look sharp
at what
mr saavik all stop
all stop sir
descend ten thousand meters stand by photon torpedoes
cease fire look sharp
power levels quite low sir
mr scott can you get the mains back on line ?
saavik get us out best speed !
aye sir
time from my mark
two minutes ten seconds
engine room ! what s happening ? !
time !
three minutes thirty seconds
distance from reliant
admiral on the bridge !
as you were mr saavik
aye sir on course to ceti alpha all is well
good i believe you already know my uh son
yes well why don t you show him around and
aye sir
stop engines
stop engines
course plotted for regula i admiral
engage warp engines
reliant in our section this quadrant sir and slowing
visual
mr sulu the shields !
trying sir !
i can t get power sir !
scotty !
mr sulu lock phasers on target and await my command
phasers locked
approaching regula and space lab regula i
try again
admiral on the bridge
battle stations
phaser lock inoperative sir
best guess mr sulu fire when ready
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
aye captain
may i remind the captain that if a starship enters the zone
i am aware of my responsibilities mister
now entering the neutral zone
shields activated !
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission
we are over our heads mr sulu get us out of here
i will try captain
aft thrusters mr sulu
aft thrusters sir
we are clear and free to navigate
course heading captain ?
prepare for warp speed
ready sir
fire all phasers !
no power to the weapons system sir
very well mr saavik clear all moorings
aye sir
all moorings are clear captain
thank you mr saavik
lieutenant how many times have you piloted a starship out of spacedock ?
never sir
take her out mr saavik
aye sir
certainly
by the book
you lied
i exaggerated
heard there was some excitement
just a couple of kooks
you sent them away without even letting me say goodbye ?
gillian
he never jokes perhaps the professor could use your computer
please
no ! no what did you have in mind ?
a moment alone please
bones
dammit jim they ve made him into a goddam green blooded computer !
bones stay here
no way somebody has to keep an eye on him !
it doesn t look all that different
let s hope so bones mr sulu set us down in golden gate park
oh joy
captain spock and i will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source
what did you say she was getting ?
cramps
an experimental device doctor
tearing of the middle meningeal artery
wake up man wake up !
come on pavel
he s coming round jim
pavel can you hear me ? give me your name and rank
congratulations jim i think you ve saved the earth
not me bones they did it
you just said there aren t any except on earth of the past
that is what i said doctor
then how ?
angels and ministers of grace defend us
hamlet act i scene 4
i don t think he understands
no spock it means he feels safer about your guesses than most other peoples facts
you are saying it is a compliment
it is
who are you ? doctor adams was supposed to assist me
we are just observing
i was not informed about observers
what the hell do you think you are doing ?
reading the patient s vital signs
what s causing that ! ?
captain their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power !
can you isolate the wave ?
negative it s impacting on all our systems !
damage report !
captain all systems have failed we are functioning on reserve power only
we are out of control rig for collision
find it ?
yes under u s government now we need directions
how long ?
depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor
no sir and no federation wessels on assigned patrol stations
that s odd uhura what s on the comm channels ?
shields mr chekov
shields aye
may fortune favor the foolish mr sulu warp speed !
no choice now scotty !
sir heat shields at maximum !
yes sir
dr mccoy you mr scott and commander sulu will convert us a whale tank
ah well done team 2
and admiral it s the enterprise
understood what is your plan ?
cloaking device is stable all systems normal
stabilize energy reserve ! report helm
the mains are down sir ! aux power is not responding
mr sulu switch to manual control !
attempting the hell to communicate
communicate ? communicate what ? you have no right to be here !
they like you very much but they are not the hell your whales
i suppose they told you that ?
the hell they did
so you were at berkeley
i was not
you sure you won t change your mind ?
is there something wrong with the one i have ?
no ma am no dipshit
well that s something i da let you off right here
just a little joke see you later old friend
how did you know gracie s pregnant ? nobody knows that
he s just going to hang around the bushes while we eat ?
it s his way
do you trust me ?
implicitly
good a large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions and a michelob
what s that ?
what s what ?
you got a pocket pager ? what are you a doctor ?
wanna try it from the top ?
tell me when the whales are going to be released ?
who are you ?
who do you think i am ?
what kind of spaceship is this anyway ?
a spaceship with a missing man
if we keep going up they will catch us !
calm yourself nurse scotty get us out of here !
you tricked me
you need me
oh my god we are too late !
mr sulu full power descent !
where are you going ? !
to the on board computer room to confirm my suspicion
spock ?
as suspected the probe s transmissions are the songs sung by whales
whales ?
mr spock your computations ?
in progress admiral
uhura get me through to starfleet command
weren t those a birthday present from dr mccoy ?
and they will be again spock that s the beauty of it how much ?
oh the complete works of jacqueline susan the novels of harold robbins
ah the giants
admiral full power is restored
thank you spock
admiral may i suggest that dr mccoy is correct we must help chekov
is that the logical thing to do spock ?
no admiral but is the human thing to do
right will you help us ?
mr spock where the hell is the power you promised me ?
admiral you must wait one damn minute
spock did braking thrusters fire ?
they did admiral
then where the hell are we ?
spock condition report !
no data admiral computers are non functional
guidance is functional onboard computer will interface with federation memory bank
weapons systems ?
estimating planet earth one point six hours present speed
continue on course chekov any signs of federation escort ?
warp two three
steady as she goes
warp nine nine point two nine point three
mr sulu we need breakaway speed !
hang on sir nine point seven point eight breakaway threshold
steady ! ! now mr sulu !
mr sulu ? mr sulu ? !
aye sir ?
what is our condition ?
sir braking thrusters seem to have fired
picture please
aye sir descending
we will divide into teams commanders chekov and uhura are assigned to the uranium problem
ready sir
go mr sulu
maintaining impulse climb wing five by zero helm steady
advise reaching 10000 steer three one zero
three one zero aye !
uhura scan for the whales 401 megahertz !
10000 m s l admiral
wing to cruise configuration full impulse power
aye sir three one zero to the bering sea e t a 12 minutes
i have no control sir !
picture uhura !
sir i ve got some back pressure on manual
ground cushion ! keep the nose up if you can
let s see what she s got mr sulu
aye sir !
systems report communications ?
communications systems ready communications officer ready as she will ever be
mr sulu ?
what is it ?
overlapping distress calls some from starships others
on screen !
then this is what it would sound like underwater ?
yes sir
admiral i am receiving whale songs
on speakers
we will stick together till we get orientated bearing to the whales ?
283 degrees 15 2 kilometers
everyone remember where we parked
any luck ?
nothing i should never have left him
uhura you did what was necessary keep trying you will find him
i ve found chekov sir he s in emergency surgery right now
uhura ! where !
mercy hospital
bearing !
bearing 327 range 600 nautical
put them on screen !
admiral i have a signal closing on the whales bearing 328 degrees
on screen
estimate range ship to whales !
sir estimating one nautical mile
unidentified aircraft 40000 feet msl range 30 miles bearing 010
mr scott how soon ?
i can t sir nothing !
out of control and blind as a bat !
mr scott how soon can we get underway ?
give me one more day sir the damage control is easy reading klingon is hard
scotty how long is this bay ?
about 60 feet admiral
that should be enough can you enclose it to hold water ?
i suppose i can sir are you planning to take a swim ?
scotty we have to find some humpbacks
humpbacked people ?
whales scotty 45 to 50 feet long about 40 tons a piece
admiral how am i going to handle all that weight ?
you will work it out scotty and remember two of them
two ?
it takes two to tango mr scott
what is it ? i thought i told you never to call me
sorry admiral we just thought you will like to know we are beaming them now
oh i see tell them phasers on stun good luck kirk out
i am ready spock let s go find george and gracie
mr sulu ?
scotty are the whale tanks secure ?
aye but i ve never beamed up 400 tons before
stay with me sir i need more power curve
how long scotty ?
10 seconds admiral 5 4 3 2 1
stand by sir miracle worker at work
mr scott don t make jokes we are in danger of
full power sir
mr sulu if you please
ironic when man was killing these creatures he was destroying his own future
the beasties seem happy to see you doctor i hope you like our little aquarium
you better get up there sir we are having some power fall off
on my way !
the whales ? !
no power to the bay doors
the explosive override ?
it s under water ! there s no way to reach it
go on ahead close the hatch !
admiral you will be trapped !
excelsior ? why in god s name would you want that bucket of bolts ?
scotty don t prejudge a ship is a ship
professor scott if you will
i demand to see the owners ! i demand
with pleasure
well that s different
if you will follow me professor
i will can my assistant come too ?
of course
hello ? computer ?
just use the keyboard
the keyboard how quaint
transparent aluminum ?
that s the ticket laddie
but it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix !
hi
hi huey 205 isn t it ?
right on you fly ?
oh here and there i flew something similar in my academy days
all right then this is old stuff to you
old yes but interesting do you mind if i ask a few questions ?
you have warp capability ?
capability yes but where can warp drive take us except away from here ?
i understand how you feel we just want to retrace data s movements that day
why ?
i don t like to leave questions unanswered
then you must spend your life answering questions
there s a cavern at the base of the next hill
this way !
mother and son you arranged this ?
i thought it might begin the healing process
there is no need for concern i am operating within normal parameters now
you are what ?
i am better
my father told me i shouldn t talk to you
i understand
i don t
don t you ever get tired ?
my power cells continually re charge themselves
i can t imagine what it would be like to be a machine
anij !
tournel will take you the rest of the way
no i want to stay with you
it is safer there i will join you shortly
i have to go home now
bye
can he breathe under water ?
data doesn t breathe
won t he rust ?
no
very funny
your captain used to cut quite a rug
prepare to transport the hostages to the ship
they should be quarantined before joining the ship s population
will he live ?
yes but look at this medscan
she s stabilizing
is it safe to move her ?
safer than leaving her here
hello data
captain geordi ?
you are aboard the enterprise
tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills
how about a passive radiation scan ?
a ship
it is clearly federation in origin captain
just a few loose ends to tie up
incomplete i might add
what you are seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields
it is conceivable i was shot to protect the secret of its existence
what possible purpose could a duplicate village have except to deceive the ba ku
why would the federation or the son a wish to move the ba ku ?
i don t know
captain i ve activated transport inhibitors around the village
good let s begin to move these people out
how many ?
another forty three people reported taken sir
i am showing fresh air behind this calcite formation captain
will the structure hold if we blast through ?
i believe it is safe sir
it isn t safe for you to remain in this area
he s right our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies
i will order riker to turn around
picard s first officer do you really believe he will listen ?
you are not going to launch anything until
in six hours every living thing in this system will be dead or dying
we are taking this ship out of here this mission is over
it is not over
it is over
i wonder which one of us will be facing that court martial
there s nothing further to be gained from this
the countdown control has been transferred to the collector i can t override
scan for lifesigns
they are following the kelbonite deposits using the interference to block our transporters
recommendations ?
we are about to lose communications with starfleet captain
do you have everything you need from command ?
the torque sensors are out of alignment by twelve microns you could hear that ?
when i was an ensign i could detect a three micron mis alignment
implants bothering you ?
it s nothing i am just tired
a photon torpedo isn t that the universal greeting when communications are down ?
i think it s the universal greeting when you don t like someone
we are pulling it like a zipper across space
options ?
eject the core
i don t think they believe us
why not ?
sir they ve detonated an isolytic burst a subspace tear is forming
on screen
the tear is closing on us impact in fifteen seconds
eject the core
the purpose being i intend to shove it down the son a s throat
commander if one of their weapons hits that gas
it s our only way out of here mister nara
commander i am showing two son a ships on an intercept course
how long til they reach us ?
eighteen minutes
i thought subspace weapons were banned by the khitomer accord
remind me to lodge a protest
we are still thirty six minutes from transmission range sir
we are through running from these bastards
they are powering their forward weapons array
blow out the ramscoop stand by full thrusters
yew cheen chef faw
deck ten
who is it ?
commander riker
admiral dougherty wants to know why we haven t left yet
we are not going anywhere
deck five
you klingons never do anything small do you
prepare the ship for departure at oh seven hundred hours
aye sir
you must be planning on doing some hunting
go back to your quarters that s an order
i wish there was a way to bring them back home
ask them
i am afraid there s too much bitterness on both sides
bridge to captain picard we are approaching sector four four one
slow to impulse we are on our way
i i must have slept through my alarm i am on my way
we will skip the court martial this time picard out
worf to picard
yes yes i can hear you
we are trying to get to you sir
worf you must hurry
we are coming as fast as we can we can t risk using phasers
i understand tell doctor crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready
captain
worf what the hell are you doing here ?
come out come out wherever you are
sir ?
hmm ? oh it s just something my mother used to
direct hit he s resetting his shield harmonics
beam him out !
he s activated a transport inhibitor
prepare to enter the atmosphere we will use the ionospheric boundary to shake him
scanners are off line !
evasive maneuvers heading one four zero mark three one
the damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire !
transferring controls to manual
did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings ?
no sir
debrief them again have you been in a fight commander ?
no sir it is a gorch
gorch ?
doctor crusher asked to talk to you when you returned
picard to crusher
should i distribute phasers to the ba ku sir ?
no we will be responsible for that mister worf
you need a haircut commander
accelerated hair growth is often experienced by klingons during jak tahla
isolinear tags their transporters can lock onto them
we have to find shelter
all injector sub systems are confirmed off line
decloak the holo ship and engage a tractor beam mister worf
one it s ru afo
can you beam him off ?
negative he s established a security field around the control room
is there any other way to disable the injector ?
population three hundred million
say the greeting again
yew cheen chef faw emphasis on the cheen and the faw
i don t see anything to suggest the son a have any interest in sociology
what are they interested in ?
wine women and song
you should feel right at home with them
why would we be involved with these people ?
good question
you haven t done that in a long time
what ?
what you are doing to my neck
was i doing something to your neck ?
this isn t one of the usual therapeutic postures
but it s comfortable
why don t you try sitting up ?
or you could try lying down
you are in quite a mood today
both i think i am having a mid life crisis
i believe you
i am not sleeping well
doctor crusher has something that will take care of that
augh
augh ?
i never kissed you with a beard before
all hands battle stations !
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up ?
initiate launch sequence
activating injector assembly
exactly as the simulations predicted
sir i am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels
your scanners must be malfunctioning
all ship functions are off line
this ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters are they all useless ?
they must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here
isolate one and re route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor
montana energize
montana ? well that answers everything why the hell are we
i have to go back to the silo will you be all right ?
i will be fine he s a different story
you actually performed surgery ?
it was an experience metal scalpels needle and thread
how long has he been unconscious ?
at least four hours
is it japanese ?
um yeah now he s going to need a respirator do you have one ?
we have two but we don t have the juice to run them
his automatic reflexes are fluctuating we ve got to get him on a respirator
bag him
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg ?
intelligence ambition desire i bring order to chaos
have you ever wondered what it s like to have flesh ?
it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference
you ve taken your first step toward perfection how does it feel ?
i do not know what you are referring to
that s because you haven t been properly stimulated yet
no i will not betray my friends
they are not your friends they ve held you back kept you from your destiny
that is not true they have tried to help me
have they given you what i have given you ? did they even try ?
i do not want this
yes
then take the final step give me the enterprise and we can be together always
i ve deactivated the sensory inputs that flesh on your body is just meat now
no no please you cannot
isn t it better like this ?
yes but the enterprise my duty
is to yourself don t make me hurt you again
no no it s so empty please give it back i need it
and i need to control this ship let me into your mind
there is a perimeter alert a ship has entered sensor range
vulcan ?
no
dispersive armor is holding
bring us about target borg ship alpha four port side battery
the borg ship has modified its shields captain our phasers will no longer be effective
ready quantum torpedo
i have helm control
where s the sphere ?
the vortex is collapsing sir
contact starfleet command
what year is it ?
according to our astrometric readings the year is 2063
apr cell count ? what the hell are you talking about ?
doctor crusher has been studying some advanced medical theories
where s the battery room for the hospital ?
i told you there s no
where ?
outside around back next to the water tank
what did you do to the batteries ?
oh just a little tinkering how is he ?
i have the silo sir bearing three one zero distance three hundred meters
let s go
i am picking up faint life signs twenty meters below
there should be an access hatch nearby
alphanumeric lock we need a password to get in
i have the password right here
blast door it s designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched
there should be some kind of manual release
picard to enterprise enterprise please respond
it could be the radiation captain try from the surface
ready to make a little history ?
always am
phoenix to control initiating five minute countdown mark
we can t leave her out there when the ship launches she will be killed
tell her to go back to resurrection
she s a very determined woman phoenix to control mister lange let her in
captain
this is picard i ve suspended the launch sequence
ready to deploy the warp nacelles
as they used to say all systems are go
passing one half light speed the starboard nacelle s running a little hot
i am on it
captain the enterprise !
picard to enterprise picard to enterprise do you read me ?
they are getting awfully close what the hell are they doing ?
we are crossing the threshold !
atr setting
active
main bus
ready
initiate pre ignition sequence
where in the states ?
oh here and there you know how it is
not really i was born and raised right here never had much use for travel
where are you from most recently ?
california san francisco
beautiful city used to be anyway i didn t think anyone still lived there
there s a few of us left
you seem to have an answer for everything
something wrong with that ?
not yet
there is no invasion
wrong answer mister picard try again
from another planet oh i almost forgot they have green blood and pointed ears
and you know all this because u you are u a space man too
i am afraid you ve caught me i am a space man
take care of him he s a very special man
yes he is
were the two of you involved ?
no not like you and doctor crusher used to be
how did you know about that ?
i d say you already have
don t flatter yourself i take pictures of a lot of junk
signal the endeavor to fall back we will cover them
aye sir
incoming transmission from the borg
on screen
life signs ?
population thirty five billion all borg
track their weapons fire
western hemisphere north american continent
port battery ready sir !
fire
captain there are five borg ships closing in on our position
data set a course for that vortex
hull integrity down to thirty percent
steady as she goes
target locked !
fire !
incoming transmission from starfleet command admiral hayes
onscreen
we are caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex
worf torpedo now !
they must ve done it in the past they went back and changed history
they did it they assimilated earth
report
we are still in earth orbit
on screen
looks like they damaged the silo
life signs ?
can t tell long range bio sensors are off line
good luck sir
i will keep in contact you have the bridge
return to our own time ?
yes sir
then make it so have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex ?
yes sir but captain are we all going back ?
unless you d like to stay
no sir
casualties are light captain minor buckling on the port nacelle nothing serious
incoming message from the starship intrepid admiral hayes
a ship wide decompression has been initiated !
what ?
what the hell is happening worf ?
it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room
what are they doing ?
they appear to be modifying the deflector dish
they are re routing the deflector power conduits
computer thermal enhancement
they are connecting the conduits to subspace communications
they are converting the deflector dish into an antennae
we have to stop them from sending that message
agreed options ?
destroy the deflector dish
worf ! i am going to need at least five minutes !
understood !
report !
we ve lost bridge control !
emergency override !
nothing
all right we ve lost control of eight decks three cargo bays one shuttlebay
do we have any idea how many borg we are dealing with ?
they are bypassing engineering
where the hell are they going ?
i remember it made me sick
what are you suggesting ?
i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll
i have to admit there was a moment there when
hold that thought
worf to bridge
riker here
there s a dampening field in place on this deck our tricorders are useless
worf to bridge we are about to enter the environmental control room
any sign of data or the borg themselves ?
worf ? is something wrong ?
something is very wrong commander we are falling back
what the hell happened down there worf ?
commander we have a problem
captain they are firing at a nuclear missile silo in central montana
target
even data ?
data s positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise command codes security protocols
good luck captain
i am going too they may need a doctor
i believe the operation is over
the charge is murder
i am going to perform surgery on a torpedo you never know
you may need assistance doctor
fascinating
bet you wish you d stood in bed
vulcans sleep lying down
spock that was actually funny
we do sleep lying down
calm yourself doctor the operation is almost complete
thank you nurse jim she s ready ! lock and load !
pity they are retiring us just as i was starting to understand you spock
we were beginning to hit our stride together doctor
or not to be
that s the question
uh jim
you heard the order lieutenant
what the hell s going on ?
i wish i knew uhura ?
sweet jesus ! he s lost a lot of whatever this stuff is
can you ?
jim i don t even know his anatomy
no !
chancellor gorkon can you hear me ? chancellor ?
thanks
what s the brotherhood of aliens ?
figures
we ve been set up all along
three months till retirement what a way to finish
we are not finished
speak for yourself one day one night
what is it with you anyway ?
still think we are finished ?
more than ever
what kind of creature is this ? last night you two were spooning
don t remind me
jim leave me i am finished
no way you see this ?
damned clever if you ask me
killed trying to escape it s a classic
absolutely not !
come on
perhaps with a few small steps at a time like this one
and perhaps with a large step or two like a peace treaty
we are explorers not diplomats !
starfleet s killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of exploration
this is fun
captain shall we attempt to return fire ?
too bad we can t smell her
in space no one can hear you sweat
are you carrying a surgeon ?
we were until your torpedoes !
then let me help !
doctor mccoy what is your current medical status ?
aside from a touch of arthritis i d say pretty good
was chancellor gorkon alive when you first examined him ?
barely
have you saved patients as barely alive as he was ?
i didn t have the knowledge of klingon anatomy i needed
you say you are due for retirement may i ask do your hands shake ?
they will respect him now
that s a comfort
i ve always wanted to meet you captain
i am not sure how to take that
would you care to go topside ?
very much
he s a doctor !
how can i trust
are those your words ?
yes
spoken by you ?
yes
louder please we cannot hear you
those words were spoken by me
as captain i am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command
your honors the state rests
where is mr sulu ?
captain sulu on assignment anyone seen spock ?
captain you are not going to show them the bridge ? ?
full diplomatic courtesy mr chekov
just the size of my head
i know what you mean
torpedo room ?
uhura monitor !
captain if they fire at us with our shields down
torpedo bay ! did we fire those torpedoes ?
from starfleet ?
who else ?
where is the conference ?
she s only a cog in the wheel no way she knows that
shields battle stations
shields up battle stations
mr chekov take us forward thrusters only one half impulse power
aye sir thrusters
mr chekov slow down take us forward thrusters only one quarter impulse power
aye sir thrusters
course heading captain ?
second star to the right and straight on till morning
they are preparing to fire
shields up captain ?
klingon blood
they must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here
this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory
now we go to starfleet ?
now we expand our search to include uniforms
all uniforms ?
aye sir
mr valtane any more data ?
captain i am getting a message from klingon high command
onscreen
an incident ?
do we report this sir ?
are you kidding ? send to starfleet command
we d be delighted to accept your gracious invitation
we will make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours
i shall look forward to it
thank you captain kirk the evening has been most edifying
we must do this again soon
i ve heard of chameloids shapeshifters i thought you were mythical
give a girl a chance captain
your friends are late
they will be here
isn t it about time you became something else ?
i like it here
what took you so long ?
kill him ! he s the one ! !
not me idiot him !
he wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens
he s got it
and your coat
fraid not it wouldn t fit him anyway
krandog aranty
how did you know ?
there s a reward for your death
we don t get many presidential assassins
we didn t kill gorkon
of course not anyway somebody up there wants you out of the way
how much time s left of your sentence ?
don t you know ? everyone on rura penthe is here for life
that s not his knee not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place captain
anything else you want to tell me ?
listen no one has ever escaped from rura penthe
except us
it is possible
maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed
energize
stand down your weapons
captain if
stand down mr scott all stop that s an order
aye sir
this is incredible
who else ?
as you were lieutenant ?
saavik sir we were told you d need a helmsman so i volunteered
aft thrusters
thank you lieutenant one quarter impulse power
captain may i remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock ?
aye sir
plot a course for kronos lieutenant
kronos sir ?
i am still in the chair lieutenant
aye sir
sorry
come on saavik you could knock
we are almost at the rendezvous i thought you d want to know
right
uhura hailing frequencies right standard rudder bring us alongside
right standard rudder z plus five degrees
i hope you are happy
captain
saavik you know anything about a neutron energy surge ?
sir ?
mr chekov anything unusual ?
captain our shields !
uhura signal our surrender
just the prototype
you hear that ?
i have personally vouched for you in this matter captain
you have personally
never been this close
the chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal
i believe the captain feels that starfleet s mission has always been one of peace
far be it for me to dispute my first officer starfleet has always
what is it ?
i am uncertain
spock i am really tired
we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation
where ?
curiously it appears to emanate from us
from enterprise ?
what the
we ve fired on the chancellor s ship
we haven t fired
according to the data bank we have twice
captain
he was just about to explain the whole damn
i ve been dead before uhura raise excelsior she ought to have the co ordinates
why would they give them to us ?
the commander is an old friend of yours
close enough to beam down ?
not yet section 4236
what s she waiting for ?
probably trying to figure out why we are reversing wondering if we detect her
the only way to find out if a man s trustworthy
is to trust him
control tower reading sir
control this is enterprise requesting permission to depart
channel open captain
this is the starship enterprise captain james kirk commanding
captain
we surrender
this is enterprise we surrender repeat enterprise surrenders
gorkon s own man ? ?
who else ?
uhura ?
nothing captain if they are here they are rigger for silent running
captain we can t see her but she gives off heat
not from a distance she won t show up on any type of scan
you must have faith
faith ?
that the universe will unfold as it should
her own father ?
such things have happened before sir
a lie ?
an error
if you are logical
i don t want to
i believe you please
direct hit
confirmed captain !
according to this we ve completed our exploration of the entire sector
fifty four planets and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies our sensing and analytic equipment worked well
then it s time we were heading home three years is
i have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port
visual !
i have confirmed the location sir but
what is it ?
i cannot confirm the existence of praxis
praxis ?
what s left of it
no way !
mr scott you forget yourself please accompany me
it s as i said mr spock inventory still registers every torpedo
yet the data banks insist we fired twice one computer is lying
a computer canna lie sir
i think not
you can check the torpedoes visually if you like
we will have to check every one of them mr scott
that could take hours !
nevertheless
and if they are still in place ?
then someone forged a data bank entry
twenty four hours from now we won t have a clue where the captain is
i know precisely where he will be
they dinna fire on themselves and there were no other ships present
there was an enormous neutron energy surge
not from us !
too far off very near us perhaps underneath us
if another ship had been beneath us the klingons would ve seen her !
would they ?
a bird of prey canna fire when she s cloaked !
this one can
they you are talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction mr spock
i believe i am
they are outside the beaming shield mr scott start your engines
aye aye sir
they are naturally wary ma am we ve been at war a long time
how do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice ?
sulu s giving us his position and telling us he s standing by
he s placing himself in a most awkward position
i don t think starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament
maybe we should write them a letter ?
they might as well arrest me too i felt like lieutenant saavik
but you didn t join a conspiracy
do you know who i am ?
you are me
no my name is data i am your brother
do you know where you are ?
i am in a room with lights
can you remember our father ?
no
do you know the name of the captain of this vessel ?
no
is that your final answer ?
brother i cannot move
no i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines
why ?
because you are dangerous
why ?
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship
i do not understand
i know
do you know anything about shinzon s plans against the federation ?
no
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship ?
no can i move now ?
no i must deactivate you
for how long ?
indefinitely
how long is that ?
when was he created ?
about twenty five years ago they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell
i think a skin cell s the more likely of the two
beverly come in
you are working late
remember him ?
he was a bit proud as i recall
he was a damn fool selfish and ambitious very much in need of seasoning
he turned out all right
aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels you are completely normal
can you describe it deanna ?
how long does he have ?
i can t be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating
so to happy endings
to happy endings
the closest signature is two kilometers to the west that direction sir
thank you data let s see what she can do
the final signature is approx imately 300 meters up that incline
mister worf accompany data please
he is very observant
i can see that
data !
sorry sir
a bit less florid data
aye sir this way
a weapon
it would appear so
what do you imagine this is ?
port thrusters sir would you like me to drive ?
do you think this is a wise course of action ?
we are about to find out power up disruptors and fire on my mark
ready captain
fire !
how long until we reach the fleet ?
at our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes
we are losing dorsal shields
full axis rotation to port ! fire all ventral phasers !
captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine
divert power and compensate
we are being hailed
deanna stand by open a channel
sir allow me to go you are needed here
negative
sir
why am i looking at me ?
you are not looking at your self you are looking at me
you do not look like me
you have a red shirt
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation
why ?
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle
why ?
we have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten
emergency force fields are holding
what is our approximate distance ?

it appears to be an arm
why is it moving ?
like me it has been designed with modular power sources
it s you
the resemblance is striking
no
i would like to pick you up now may i do that ?
if you wouldn t mind
thank you
may i have this dance ?
with pleasure captain
counselor
do you have a moment sir ?
of course sit down
i am going to miss you
and i you
how can you be certain ?
i know how he thinks
captain i might have a way to find them
counselor ?
the one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle me
make it so
but how can he ? he will kill you
this isn t about me anymore
imzadi this is so good
no !
i will always be with you now now and forever
you sick bastard !
no
i can feel your desire deanna
captain picard commander donatra of the warbird valdore might we be of assistance ?
your timing is impeccable commander
the empire considers this a matter of internal security we regret you ve become involved
when this is over i owe you a drink
i am afraid that drink will have to wait captain
do you have life support ?

understood
i read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface
what do we know about the population ?
cannon fodder
then how did a reman get to be praetor ? i don t get it
what s he doing ?
he wants to look me in the eye
he thinks he knows exactly what i am going to do
sir ?
we ve got him !
how long until he can fire ?
the targeting sequence should take about four minutes
sir we are being hailed
on screen
enterprise we are the reman warbird scimitar
praetor shinzon i am pleased to
i am not shinzon i am his viceroy we are sending transport coordinates
i won t do it
won t do what mister worf ?
captain i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear naked
come now a big strapping fellow like you ? what are you afraid of ?
i am picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system
what sort of signature ?
to find the head sir ?
if you don t mind
sir i recommend we raise shields
not yet mister worf
no !
captain !
tactical analysis mister worf
fifty two disruptor banks twenty seven photon torpedo bays primary and secondary phased shields
we are being hailed
on screen
sir we ve had an unauthorized access into the main computer
who was it ?
sir we are being hailed
on screen
coordinate our attack with the valdore s tactical officer triangulate fire on any shield impacts
aye sir
captain the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock
on my way please notify commander riker
what s this ?
your new chair sir
diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone
still well on our side
captain you have an alpha priority communication from starfleet command
acknowledged i will talk to data
we have to assume he had romulan collaborators
a coup d etat ?
the praetor s power has always been the romulan fleet they must be behind him
she s not out for a pleasure cruise
she s a predator
not very chatty
away team transporter room four
he wasn t designed to live a complete human life span
can anything be done for him ?
strength in numbers ?
we can only hope so
report
he s firing through his cloak we can t get a lock
serving with you has been an honor
the honor was mine captain riker
i hope you will forgive the darkness we are not comfortable in the light
praetor shinzon ?
and you are not as we imagined you
no ?
praetor ?
i ve never met a human woman
romulan ale i am surprised i can t stand it
you will acquire a taste for it
after you praetor
age before rank jean luc
so i am not as tall as you expected ?
i always hoped i would hit two meters
with a full head of hair
there is that
in time jean luc
in time
hello jean luc
why am i here ?
i was lonely
that s your life not mine
please
it s too late
you can still make a choice ! make the right one now !
i have no choices ! i can t fight what i am !
praetor we ve received the transponder signal
on my way
report !
two ships decloaking sir ! romulan !
target disruptors destroy them
disruptors are off line sir
deploy the weapon kill everything on that ship then set a course for earth
what about picard ?
our greater goal is more important brother
but praetor you won t survive without him
well that sounds relaxing too
it is invigorating
so they ve got him up and running
he s a very unusual android
runs in the family
my god
should i raise shields ?
minimal damage to the scimitar
defensive pattern kirk epsilon geordi get those shields online
believe it or not i think the cavalry has arrived
we are being hailed
intruder alert !
let s go
are we prepared ?
yes praetor
this is a mistake
he s gentler than i thought and he has a sense of humor
don t forget our mission shinzon we should act now time is running out
my time i will spend it how i choose
the bond is broken
find her again
no this is wasting time
do as i tell you !
it s accelerating you have no more time for games
have the doctors prepare i will be on the bridge
how long ?
a matter of hours now
how long until we reach the rift ?
seven minutes
praetor
full stop and fire !
what is it ? ! ! focus on your job ! !
she is here
how many warbirds will you need ?
none
then i don t understand the reason for the delay !
you don t have to understand
and bringing the enterprise here ? ! what possible purpose could that serve ?
i have a purpose
then perhaps you will enlight en us ?
silence romulan !
benny god take it easy
i don t want to scare them away
what did i tell you ?
probably kids
don t you think you should call a backup ?
no we can handle this
mike call for back up benny you all right ?
i don t think so
benny this is me i am going to take a look
gate three it s boarding now

elmo s

about five miles back

it s a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes
houston found it in the extraterrestrial s suit
they must have picked it up in space
contain it and get back to me
what do you mean by contain ?
why did you let it get into a populated area ?
it s taken on a disguise
clarify that
it s made itself look like the woman s dead husband
the extraterrestrial now looks like this

the gulls were after your fish mr sholes really let s be logical about this
what were the crows after at the school ?
what do you think they were after miss ?
daniels i think they were after the children
for what purpose ?
to to kill them
how do you plan to do that ?
with smoke
how can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke ?
can we go on living here otherwise ?
scotch light on the water
you and mr sholes seem to be implying as much
birds ?
yeah birds all they do is make a mess of everything who needs them ?
we need them
not if they are starting a war
they are incapable of organized warfare !
then fight back get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth
that would hardly be possible
kill them all get rid of them messy animals
probably contain more than a hundred billion birds !
i am going out that way lady you can follow me
then let s go now !

wait a minute wait a minute ! bombs don t unscrew
it s no meteor that s for sure !
darnedest thing i ever saw the way that s unscrewing !
hey there open up !
come on out ! we are friends !
that explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move
madrid has just blacked out ! ! nothing more coming through
the same thing that happened on our pacific coast anything from them yet ?
mister secretary if they link up with those others near fresno
all right i ve seen enough !
hurry up ! jump in !
there was a girl with them if i could find her
you look kinda lost yourself
but i think i know where she will be
is that it over there ?

he s top man in astro and nuclear physics he knows all about meteors !
i do know him slightly

they ve all stopped at the same time
there s only about one explanation for a thing like this got a pin ?
how does it happen cars are running ?
automobile ignitions are insulated
how long was i out ?
hours i ve been so scared !
maybe they aren t too sure we are here
they could be as curious about us as we are about them
maybe maybe they want to take us alive
i probably wouldn t be able to get to them if i tried
you will be all right with us for as long as anybody s got !
don t let s lose each other
that s what knocked the phones out too
how could it happen to everybody s watch together ?
have you got a pocket compass ?
that needle ain t pointing north !
it s pointing out to the gully where that meteor came down
what is that gizmo ? !
i think that gizmo is a machine from another planet
we better get word to the authorities and look !
a forlorn hope but there is a chance
it might give us time to search out some weakness in the martians
i believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood
there s one there s the other and we are right between them !
so is the town i notice !
i warned you civil defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate
i just came to tell you everyone has been alerted
that probably dropped half way to pomona ! what do you think ?
it was nearer than that
they don t do much of anything !
there s a square dance at the social hall this evening
must be somebody in there

when was that ?
the twenty third of january on that night one of our elder nuns passed away
sister paul ?
yes i don t remember where agnes was i was needed in the sick room
and my permission ?
i d like yours too
we will see about that
don t deny it !
i haven t decided yet
the woman s health is at stake
her spiritual health
i don t give a damn about her spiritual health
i know you don t
do you think agnes is still attached to god ?
listen to her singing
i d like to begin
begin what ?
the hypnotism do you still disapprove ?
would it stop you if i did ?
no
may i be present ?
of course
then let s begin
stop this she will hurt herself i am not going to allow this
no no i said leave her alone
this is permission to take her apart
where is she ?
hasn t she had enough ?
i have a few more questions to ask her
my god but you are determined
that s enough
agnes what happened to the baby ?

what happened to the baby ?
oh don t do this !
wasn t it !
lay them down

locked
kill drive engines
engines off
nine hundred meters and dropping 800 700 hang on gentlemen
good ! maybe we will be able to see something then
or something will be able to see us
there could be a whole city out there and we d never see it
not sitting on our butts in here that s for sure
dell what s the last thing you can remember ?
i don t know
do you remember the pyramid ?
no just some horrible dreams about smothering where are we ?
where s irth ?
sandy scan the whole sky
i don t recognize that constellation
dell plot our location
i got it oh boy
where the hell are we ?
just short of zeta ii reticuli we haven t even reached the outer rim yet
can you get it a little closer ?
that s what i am going to do
any rotation ?
yeah two hours
gravity ?
point eight six we can walk on it
close enough to walk to !
martin would you run me an atmospheric ?
i am sending do you hear me ?
receiving
i will go first
no you will follow me
just machinery
but functioning
what is it ?
take a look
maybe we can get in by the top
you want to try ?
sure
can we come up ?
no it s too small only room enough for one person
can you see anything in the hole ?
dell you want to come down we can figure out where to go from here
no i want to go in
okay i am in the mouth of the chimney now and i am starting down
take care
how do you feel dell ?
wretched what happened to me ?
don t you remember ?
don t remember nothing can t hardly remember my name
hell you are in great shape you ve got your sense of humor back !
god i am hungry
what s wrong ?
i don t know i am getting these u cramps u !
breathe deeply
u oh god it hurts so bad u !
computer this is captain standard what conditions are you talking about ?
i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin
a transmission ?
a voice transmission
i have recorded the transmission
play it for us please
computer what language was that ?
unknown
i have interrupted the course of the voyage
what ? u why u ?
i am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise
unknown ! what do you mean ?
it is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man
yes !
i have a temporary sequence on the monitor
hold it i can t hear a damn thing !
just a minute hold it i am checking
has the hull been breached ?
how long to fix ?
hard to say
well get started
right talk to you
hello faust !
yeah !
how s it coming on the engines ?
u he u died
what ?
not u they u u he u
where s it coming from ?
machine s screwed up i can t tell needle s spinning all over the dial
okay
that way
what happened to the lights ?
bulbs burned out nobody bothered to replace em
where does that go ?
all over the ship we will have to check the charts to know for sure
what happened ? where s sandy ?
dead
dead !
it s monstrous it grew like some horrible tapeworm we were completely unprepared
it s still in the ship ?
oh god oh
is it alive ?
oh no oh no
what was that ? what the christ was that ?
and then we run out of food and oxygen
the water will still recycle
jay how s it coming on the repairs ?
well i am going to have to blow the engines out
and when will you be ready to do that ?
oh i am not near ready yet
then why the hell are you sitting around here ?
right
it s really on there tight
here let me try
hey guess what ?
what ?
the engines are fixed
this dust is getting clogged in the intakes again !
just hold us together till we are in space that s all !
might even incinerate the damn thing
i hope not
so it s trapped in between now we have to drive it out
poison gas
hey are you guys still there ? what s going on ?
meet us on the bridge be careful it s u huge u now
right
all right but do u not u go below decks
right
and be right back
where did it come from ?
u he s u the only one that knows that
how does he breathe ?
blood s thoroughly oxygenated
yeah but how ? his nose and mouth are blocked
god that smoke s poisonous !
it s eating a hole in the floor !
i never saw anything like that in my life except molecular acid
but this thing uses it for u blood u
hell of a defense mechanism you don t dare kill it
it makes me sick to see him like that
isn t there some way we can get it off him ?
it s a crude symbolic language looks primitive
you can t tell that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits
we can t go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose
we d be sitting ducks in the freezers
it s over hunter
boy that s terrific
well how does it feel to be rich men ?
that thing god almighty didn t you try to get it off him ?
it wouldn t come
hey now what is this ?
ask him
there should be coming through about there
careful don t get under it !
i will do it the rest of you continue
i will come with you
now we are in for it
the door was closed it must still be in here
yes ?
how s broussard ?
he s running a fever
still unconscious ?
yes
can you do anything for him ?
the machine will bring his temperature down his vital functions are strong
good
while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net
sounds like a rough one
got a better idea ?
we d better seal off the lower maintenance level at least trap it there
at least it can t get up here now
we ve got six hours left
oh my god
does anybody know what happened ?
you can t say that i think it s a good plan
the flamethrower needs more fuel
right we ve got a lot to accomplish let s get moving
the ship s gravitational attraction must have drawn him back
should we go outside and bring him in ?
no the risk is too great perhaps after we ve destroyed the thing
it will be
what we really need is some red meat in here for bait
it must have stopped moving i am not getting anything
let me go first you stay behind me
the flamethrower !
i can t the acid will pour out !
now what s wrong ?
i ve completely lost their signal
can you get them back ?
i am trying
i ve got em ! they are back on my screens !
how many ?
three blips ! they are coming this way !
oh no
jay this is cleave ! meet me at the main air lock !
i keep my mouth pretty much shut but i don t like hitting
i guess i had it coming let s call it settled
what s happening up here ?
i think it s fizzled out
this is horrible
hey ! what about the film ?
what common objects ?
listen hadn t somebody better check on broussard ?
you mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him ?
it was horrible horrible like a chicken
don t count on it
we sure need this flamethrower
blow the ship up ?
and the creature with it we can make it back to irth in the lifeboat
sandy you want to give us some vision ?
feast your eyes
first contact
sandy can you home in on that beam ?
what s the frequency ?
computer what s the frequency of the transmission ?
that way
you lead
what s wrong ?
my signal s fading
it s close real close
how far ?
we should be almost on top of it i just can t quite
air lock ?
who knows ?
doesn t seem much doubt about it does there ?
that creature sure must have considered it important using his last strength to draw it
this looks ancient
can t tell these weather conditions could erode anything fast
what d he say ?
i couldn t make it out too much interference
there it caught !
is it still coming up or is it hooked on something ?
no it s coming
can you see anything ?
u what is it u ?
u don t touch him watch it u !
oh god oh god no
help me i am going to try to get it off
it s not coming off not without his whole face coming off too
let s let the machine work on him
no thank god just missed him
is it still dripping ?
it appears to have healed itself
we are going home we are in hyperspace
we are going into the freezers now
how ?
room by room corridor by corridor
i ve got hunter and something else as well in front of him
are they close ?
they are on the next level up
let s get moving with this net
my god it s stormy for a piece of rock that size !
just a second those aren t water vapor clouds they have no moisture content
source of transmission is to the northeast about 300 meters
close
it appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort it blocks the x rays
that tube must be depositing it in him
could be some kind of venom or poison
we do know that
yeah ?
they never made it off the planet the parasites won
where are we ?
sandy contact traffic control
oh my god
well it s finally happened
it s out of focus
no that s atmosphere cloud layer
atmospheric turbulence dust storm
turn on navigation lights
what the hell happened ?
engine room what happened ?
yeah okay
sandy how far are we from the source of the transmission ?
okay chaz i hear you i ve got you on my board
good i am getting you clear too let s just keep the line open
martin uh we ve found it
found what ?
it appears to be some sort of spacecraft we are going to approach it
martin ?
i agree this is the single most important discovery in history
but ?
what killed it ?
find anything we missed ?
i don t even know what i am looking for
still worried ?
oh well you know me
i ve always respected your opinion martin if something worries you it worries me
this ship is full of cat hair
tell you what martin as soon as the engine s fixed
here chaz
we are coming up now open the outer lock door
chaz what happened to broussard ?
it s some kind of organism it s attached itself to him let us in
i understand why you did that
good
look at these suckers no wonder we couldn t get it off him
is that its mouth ?
take us up
up one kilometer jay
engaged
let s take her into an escape orbit
we made it ! damn we made it !
you bet we made it martin set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive
with great pleasure
what s it doing having a seizure ?
it started crashing around right after we locked it in
now what ?
i guess we open the door and net it
this stuff s deadly i hope we know what we are doing
go ahead jay
now what ?
what do you think ? now we go in
so the only question left is who gets to crawl down the airshaft ?
let s be democratic
how did it get so u big u ?
by eating our food supplies
two down four to go
what s that supposed to mean ?
nothing
which presumably means
more spores coming
u hey watch it u !
it s stable it doesn t hurt to drop it
yes and maybe launch the boat and blow it too if the others are injured
who gets the privilege ?
kill me
what did it do to you ?
look
that was melkonis it ate hunter
i will get you out of there
no don t
but i can save you get you to the autodoc !

eve i ve heard the most wonderful things about your performance
mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all
we are having lunch with a movie talent scout
they certainly don t waste much time
nothing definite yet it s just to have lunch
i was wondering whether you d come at all
don t get up and don t act as if i were the queen mother
i don t expect you to be pleasant
i don t intend to be
can t we sit down ? just for a minute
i ve got a lot to say and none of it is easy
there can t be very much
oh but there is
and easy or not i won t believe a word
why shouldn t you ? please sit down
she knows enough not to be here
but not all of it not that lloyd and i are going to be married
congratulations eve
thank you karen
hello miss harrington
how do you do mr richards
no thank you yes i ve seen every performance
every performance ? then am i safe in assuming you like it ?
i d like anything miss channing played
well it started with the play before this one
are membrance
it s been a real pleasure eve
i hope so mr richards good night
you haven t noticed my latest bit of interior decorating
well you ve done so much what s new ?
the curtains i made them myself
they are lovely aren t they lovely birdie ?
while you are cleaning up i will take this to the wardrobe mistress
don t bother mrs brown will be along for it in a minute
no trouble at all
don t get up and please stop acting as if i were the queen mother
i am sorry i didn t mean to
if you d like
i wouldn t like
the hors d oeuvres are here is there anything else i can do ?
thank you eve i d like a martini very dry
good evening mr dewitt
i had no idea you knew each other

she s just outside the door
the heave ho
dear birdie won t you sit down miss worthington ?
harrington
i am so sorry harrington won t you sit down ?
would you like a drink ? it s right beside you
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you d seen the play
how much time have we ?
roughly ten minutes
how far to the station ?
three or four miles
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas ?
none in sight there aren t many along this back road
not many car either not much chance of a lift
he always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical
it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down
be brave he will come back with or without gas
do you want it on ?
it doesn t matter
i detest cheap sentiment
i remember
you will be there won t you

in a minute
lloyd be careful

nothing much she apologized
what s so funny ?
nothing
who is it ? what s it all about ?
did miss harrington tell you to call mr richards ?

i like that girl that quality of quiet graciousness
among so many quiet qualities
the general atmosphere is very macbethish what has or is about to happen ?
what is he talking about ?
there you are both of you max karen has decided it s time to go

not exactly sometimes though i wish i understood you better
when you do let me in on it
i will
karen and i just don t want an accident
i have no intention of having an accident !
it s not important whether you do we are wearing long underwear
and bill especially bill eve did that too

guenevere
you are not listening your heart is not love is deaf as well as blind
excalibur ! is it true ?
the lady of the lake take it take it quickly !

oh yes i ve heard of you doctor
just one general
yes ?
where can i get a cab back to town ?
yes alan
meet grant this is dr michaels chief of the medical section
glad to have you with us mr grant
line of dialogue cut off
i don t agree just because he s often difficult
difficult ? he s impossible !
that s no reason to suspect him of disloyalty
listen the heart
yes slowed down agreat deal
that s beside the point now i don t see the sense of going on
we must !
with no laser
wouldn t it be quicker if we all helped ?
yes there s no time to spare and those fibers can be quite tenacious
doctor
yes cora
i i want to say
what is it ? anything wrong ?
i just wanted to thank you for taking me along
thank you for volunteering
never saw that not even under an electron mrcroscope
they are much smaller than bacteria
yes a fistula too small to show up on the x rays
but big enough for us
cora is something wrong with the laser ?
i don t know yet doctor and i won t know until i test it
he s making a fine recovery
he certainly is he should be up and about in no time
that will teach you where to keep your hand
now i know
i never never imagined it could be anything like this
i always thought it was nothing but red
at which point the heart will be stopped by electric shock
and if it should take more time to get through
look at that they are changing color
doctor is it possible ? that we are seeing it happen before our eyes ?
looks like you didn t batten it down too well
but i did i am positive !
then how come it worked loose ?
i have no idea
shouldn t you answer that ?
not now we need air not greetings !
you must carry spare parts
not anything built into the chassis if it hadn t come loose
open it ! open it before they get here !
i can t till the hatch is flooded !
no need to get up
i feel much better now
thank you for saving my life
that s what they pay me for
a great deal more than that i believe
such as ?
keeping an eye on dr duval
what gives you that idea ?
we better get back to the sub every second counts now
look ! they follow the direction of her glance are startled to see
doctor what s wrong ?
i can t breathe ! i ve got to get out !
it s too late now we must go on
we can t take a second more
captain head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it
what can we do ?
nothing against all that force
and certain chemicals involving proteins
you left something out
what s that ?
the breath of god
removal point ? what are you talking about !
we have no alternative with only six minutes left we will just barely make it
i d hate to get lost on that freeway
they all lead to the same place the lungs
isn t there another surgical procedure you can try ?
no there s no other way
how does it look doctor ?
if i can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels
doctor we ve just about had it
it i can clear this central nerve that may be enough
you said there was a quick way out !
what about dr michaels ?
it s too late !
miss peterson his technical assistant
how are you miss peterson ?
a what ?
a forced joining of an artery and vein must ve happened when benes was hurt
that s just dandy we can t go forward and we can t go back
i am afraid there s only one thing we can do call off the mission
tell them to take us out
if there s any chance
request removal mr grant
sounds like heavy artillery
it lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime forty million beats
there it is !
fasten yourselves in there should be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again
yes with all that pressure and suction within
there s no other way tie my safety line to the sub
all right now push the snorkel through as soon as i get inside
walt for the lull between the time he inhales and exhales
well sir ? which is it ? the wireless or benes life ?
send the following message
skipper you are picking up seaweed or whatever it is
reticular fibers we ought to be clear of them soon
may i ?
go ahead
what d you do that for ?
i am married
and she said it was indelible
out of your element aren t you captain ?
sort of
that makes two of us
all in all quite a canoe
designed for piscatorial research the spawning habits of deep sea fish
remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus
prepare for miniaturization
positions please and strap yourselves in
any reserve air ?
enough to breathe but that s all
come on it s no use !
we can get out through the lab section
what is it skipper ?
we are losing pressure in the flotation tanks check the manual right over there
yes there is
could i run a tube through that wall without harming benes ?
what s wrong skipper ?
what i was afraid would happen the stuff we passed through that looked like seaweed
how s it look ?
i could use a lawnmower
captain how will you be able to follow my charts from up there ?
on the repeater
that s it
looks simple to operate
i will never find my way through that
i will guide you once we are in the heart
we could never fight that current it s physically impossible
then don t drift down further
i will do what i can
doctor the channel s getting awful narrow
we are entering a capillary remain in the middle

they are ubiquitous what we try to do is make them a little less so
and you still maintain what ? that he was murdered

he wasn t a lonely man though
what makes you think so ?

going into the barn naked or so it appears
now you were saying ?
but what is he doing ?
about to hang himself i should think
poor phillippe !
the mask is terrifying especially when unexpected do you notice ?
all i noticed was that phillippe feels even more like an animal
remember phillippe nobility is born in the heart
hold your goblet with two fingers
bloody hell
we can t stay here that traitor d artagnan knows about this place
then to the bastille
to the bastille and death
a simple theological discussion
aramis the king wishes to see you
still you serve him loyally though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem
i cannot betray louis i will defend him with my life
i know god go with you
pull them back d artagnan
you can t do it
pull them back !
everyone back
phillippe get into the boat into the boat ! now !
once you are through don t stop until you reach the river
they will know you helped us if we go this way
that doesn t matter now
forgiveness
forgiveness ?
i observe your forgiveness isn t sweeter than a plump nipple
can t you see i am praying goddammit ? !
aramis is this the way to hell ?
hell may be our destination dear porthos but not this trip
mother of god !
it is also a place of burial
a tomb ? we are in a tomb ?
catacombs very holy

we go someplace dangerous
why didn t you say so ?
let s see you rob somebody with your pistol there !

aramis these are these are whores !
so was mary magdalene and our lord loved her
did she have tits like that ?
he s going to kill you aramis
then let him kill me if all my faith is wrong
d artagnan watches everything we have to be lucky
we will make our own luck tonight if phillippe holds up
can we eat before we go ? this excitement s given me an appetite
bread and wine in that cupboard
d artagnan perhaps you should accept his offer for we are dead anyway
he is right d artagnan
he gets one day of confession each year today is the day
who does ?
best not to ask shouldn t even talk about it
what do we do now ?
i don t know about you but i plan to wait here

what ?
i am just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective
you don t miss much
part of being a new yorker
is it ever embarrassing having your bum kissed in public ?
if your ass isn t chapped you are not a good writer of note
is it sad to be an editor and bask only in reflected insincerity ?
i ve adjusted and thanks for asking
sometimes i do like for two months
weeks
whenever george tells someone how steadfast i am he always makes me sound boring
solid and genuine is not boring michael can be completely insane
you think
desperate to talk
he can t do that to me !
we are about to find out
we will never be the same
i have a suggestion
i will have to kill myself before i call him
you have no appropriate sense of emergency my best friend is ruining his life
no he s ruining yours
same difference if you love someone it s your duty to save them from themselves
you have a real philosophy of life
it s called the law of love asshole
chill we don t want your face coming off with it
chill ? since when do you say ch
when i am talking to children
this is my whole life s happiness i have to be ruthless
and you believe that
sure
jesus you are supposed to take your make up off before you apply the m
i know that ! i was distracted by grief !
zit cream ?
i wish
neosporin ?
try less appropriate
ben gay
that was thursday
elmer s glue ?
don t be ridiculous we are having a serious conversation !
i give
i can t even say it
i suppose it s too late to start over
it s too late to start over
two words
major dish
manicure
i did what i came to do
good girl
i will think about it i am okay
oh you are more than okay
excuse me ?
i can be quick i can even be funny
but i can t be dry
can you watch the road ?
see dry it s in the delivery
this is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav
you want a menage on your wedding night
i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress
not you you won t be comfortable unless you are distinctive
what else did he tell you
you hate weddings you never go
that s why michael and i were the wrong fit right from the start
he said that too
well you ve been introduced to the symphonic range of
his snoring yeah he says it s worse than ever that snaffle one ?
and loving him means loving all of this
do you get nervous in small confined spaces ?
so it s sweet of you to be protective
let me rephrase that
but nothing ever could ever did give me a moment s pause about this marriage
do you get hysterical in small confined spa
except one
you are enshrined in his heart and memory unassailable which works out great
i ve missed a step
he has you on a pedestal and me in his arms
jesus we are trapped !
ju
no this happened to me once almost it was excruciating !
about michael s job
oh that i forgot i even said th
i just think you are wrong is all
probably am forget i brought it up
but he always says
whatever is manly and independent
for the twins ? what in the world is th
gold nose hair clippers
gold dog collars ? they don t have dogs
hello
so one almost has to
exactly
exactly what ?
what you said make it appear that he s doing you the favor
he will see right through it
only if he wants to
in six months he will be happy settled successful
he won t get mad huh ?
uh kimmy ?
we settled this and i reneged that wasn t fair
look at all this beautiful food so lovingly prepared
they will eat it anyway you ever been to a walk ?
who ? the jerk who s running your life ?
this must be very very hard on him
what with the psychosis and all yeah
yeah well lots of couples are imcompat
i love him
in one minute you are going to feel so foolish
why don t you just drive a stake through my heart ?
have you ever heard of irony ?
i never want to go through this again
that s entirely understandable
well see that was a reflex to see if it would
look good on kimberly
right and then it didn t want to come off exactly
i saw the show
well maybe it works on fingers too
is anybody watching ?
i hope so this is all too mysterious to waste on just me
it s a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson michael s boss
i know ben
i thought michael was picking me up
i told him get the important stuff kim s ring i will collect the inconsequentials
i haven t caused a problem have i ?
nobody has so far
well you are a little early
i need to make some calls could i use your office ?
well that s great you haven t really had anybody since dingbat jennylee
you don t understand i ve never felt this way about anybody !
well sure
but they are so down to earth such wonderful people
you ve met her parents
well maybe we should talk ab
i need you
please come please
w
i can t wait for you to meet her !
what s the sec
mirrors
best everything joe but i am going to dance with you
dance ? you don t dance ! you learn to dance ? ?
every day she makes the bed
quite the little eccentric
at first i thought it was a gag but she s always done it !
is there a coup de grace in here somewh
she admires tommy lasorda
waiter ! check please !
she finds him personable
can that kind of defect be passed on genetically ?
gimme like eight and nine off the top ten list
first girl i ever knew who lets me give her a bath
where was that florence huh ?
firenze
the vespa ? me hanging on behind in the rain all night ?
till the gas ran out
should i whistle down a cab ?
hey cabs are expensive i am cheap remember ?
i guess you are right that would be deceitful manipulative controlling emascula
i got the point
still all s fair in love and w
that would be a girl i don t even know
you are not eating
i never eat when i am serene
you never eat when you are despondent
i switched that around when you weren t looking
last zoo we were in was beijing yeah ? sure the rhinos were fucking
boy those were the days
it s weird being the groom all these things kimmy has to take care of
you need a baby sitter that s what i am here for
wow and wow you have a date after this ?
never can tell
why don t you start being honest for one fucking sec
michael ! !
you guys are heartless my bride picked this out
like i said dazzling
big weddings are so strange
you keep saying that
kim has all this stuff to do i hardly see her
well you ve got the rest of your lives
you miss her huh ?
no i ve got you
don t you throw up on boat ?
if you like
i ve been thinking a lot the last couple days about us actually
have you
well there s a lot of memories to choose from
it s more than that
you ve sort of been y know the woman in my life
you ve been the man in mine
and i was thinking this could be our last time alone together you know ?
except for the hot affairs we will have twice a year
except for that
i can hardly wait for your wedding
me either
dance card filled ?
i will check i have it on powerbook these days
where did we first hear th
the night we met
so we heard it like right that that first
we danced to it just like this
takes me back
well
will she like it ?
yes
i am up against a deadline
me too i am getting married tomorrow
that s my point ! !
this thing means that much to y
it means a lot
what happened ?
it s over
she denied it said i was crazy and paranoid
a bad combination
should we take a walk ? or maybe some food sent up or something
i just want to be alone is that okay ?
or we will go somewhere if you have the time
if san antonio sweeps sacramento
this is her family and her fault
and your point ?
well how come she didn t
because she s as chickenshit as you are you morons are made for each other
i asked you
she admits it s her fault
does that make it right
love doesn t have to be right it just has to be love
thank god you were here
oh yeah
i was so confused so conflicted so unstable
well it happens
the big hurt huh ?
nellie fox walter likes the past and he likes the little guys
what s up ?
shhh
uh i saw that moving
don t speak !
you are not saying you actually you are saying that y
wrote it yeah i am the bad guy
are you crazy ?
i am so glad you didn t jump on that train before
i came here looking for her
why would she come here
this is where i proposed
i never forgot that
it s two weeks
almost three
that is so romantic
well the school will be here architecture will still be around right now
i travel every week college ball motor sports training camps
the most important thing is being together
because i could come
to the twins soiree ? so they can paw you and drool ?
it s not just a gag huh ?
no it s uh a real big favor
he never mentioned that neither did y
and public relations is a big problem area for him
he needs someone incredible someone really close who he can trust
like family huh ?
and to m
and you knew about this
fine i am an insensitive chauvinist asshole and you are well rid of m
michael ! !
reverend dyer this is kimberly s somewhat butch maid of honor
mr julianne potter prominent new york drag queen

blessed are the vegetarians
which one was wearing the strange clothes ?
him

i don t know this beast lost a lot of blood
objection the accused is indeed a man therefore he has no rights under ape law
well dr zira ? this is a man is he not ?
objection ! these remarks are profane and irrelevant
sustained your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature
objection !
sustained
good morning dr zira
good morning julius how s our patient today ?
no change the minute you open the door he goes into his act
you could get hurt doing that doctor
don t be silly he s perfectly tame
awww it still hurts doesn t it ?

huh ?
he s trying to form words
well you know what they say human see human do
what happened ?
those fools and their torches ! do you have any ointment ?
i will see
get me a collar and leash i am taking him to the infirmary

yes sir but this creature is a special case
why special ?
we are conducting a new experiment
dr zira tell bright eyes to sit down

this hearing is absurd ! let me tell my story
bailiff ! make the animal be quiet

dr zira ! silence that man !
this is a joke in very poor taste
is it a joke to seek the truth about this man ?
sustained
sustain all objections but face the truth !

i am trying very hard to be polite about it

i think i d like to dance
why certainly baby
i think you are drunk
just drunk enough
what s the matter baby ? don t you like being kissed ?
next time you try that mr mitchell don t i am warning you
they might think i was running away from something
possibly miss
you can have the table yourself if you d rather i am only killing time
no please
sit down then we often have a double up here
i see
dance ?
no thank you
i know it s a littler late for an apology
much too late
don t take it so big it isn t a tragedy
go ahead if you want to it doesn t matter
i d rather wait until it does matter
you tried to run away
there wasn t any plane
it s always a mistake to run away always
want a spike in it ?
no thanks
bad ?
bad enough
he could hardly help suspecting you
that s putting it mildly
cold ?
is this the best you can do ?
at this time of night it s not as bad as it looks
that man over there he was in the hotel lobby
i didn t notice him
we walked right passed him he s following us
killaine s not that sort of guy he said no he meant no
then he s got to be a detective
couldn t be
then he s
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby ?
absolutely sure
we will find out
it still doesn t matter if i kiss you ?
nothing matters
no use waiting then
that s the second round i ve lost tonight that fellow hurt me
so have i
from you i like it
i hated to go to that place i almost went to the police station instead
no percentage in that
they are going to arrest me
i know killaine has a warrant
i have my own warrant stop a minute please
i d still go through even if i ended up in jail
you wouldn t like it i ve been there
my father died in jail and he was twice the man i am
well ?
you leave it
see anything ?
i can still see the shoreline the moon is rising
there would be a moon tonight
i decided i didn t want a drink i am beginning to wonder
wonder what ?
if you are doing all this just for me
that and the fun of it
i thought you had to be back to the hotel to leave my my note
that s right
i think you mean that
do you think i was faking ?
if i did i don t now
yes miss
i d like a dry martini very dry please
sorry miss beer and ale only canadian law

regimental ! seaforth highlanders
i am sorry
stop saying you are sorry i want information not regrets
would you be satisfied if i said i shot him ?

why don t you arrest me and be done with it
i probably shall after i ve tortured you a little more

i don t want to talk
i ve come here to arrest you for murder

now and then mostly just for the fun of it
i tried it once i lost my shirt
i buy my shirts by the dozen fortunately
where did it all come from ? or is that a permissible question ?
i had a father who knew how to steal

you asked me where it all came from
oh that was just one of those idle questions one doesn t expect an answer
hello mitchell having fun ?
the liquors lovely the rest of the party you can have
good afternoon mr campbell
mr mitchell
a little something on account perhaps ?
rather more than a little something mr mitchell
i am afraid this is all for the moment
i think we d better discuss this in my office mr mitchell
nothing to discuss tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter be grateful for small mercies
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair
oh shut up ! you haven t even got your spats on
mr clarendon have you ever seen this before ?
i am sorry inspector i don t know much about
recently then
no not recently i am sure of that
thank you
i needn t keep you any longer mr clarendon
thank you it is rather late and i am not young anymore good night

it will be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet

when you sign for it you count it it s your dough
that s pretty risky business inspector

was that about the right angle ?
i think so

she might
this gun permit was issued to clark brandon ?
the card says so doesn t it ?

i figured if you were gonna then i wouldn t have to
that s what i figured too

for like twelve zillion eternities ?
a sweater
and then we can ice her no nun no evil eye
what s she doing ?
she s praying
are you going to shoot us all tough guy ?

dress rehearsal at four performance at 8 30 sharp
we sound terrible we need mary clarence
we are losing it
look what she did with the choir she made us sing beautifully
that should have tipped us
we ve got to save her !
we can t leave it up to the feds !
mary clarence how is your weaving progressing ?
oh she s doing just fine reverend mother
she shouldn t have come back she knew she was in danger
but why would anyone kidnap a nun ?
she told us about one the little sisters of the moonlight in las vegas
all right it s a beginning las vegas nevada
peace on earth
however we can also pray for other things
measles
is this like your old convent ?
which convent was that sister ?
mary clarence has a background in music that s what reverend mother said
really mary clarence ? were you a choirmistress ?
we did it ! we actually sang a chord !
that was exciting !
he s not like other guys
he s decent
he s kind
i d rather sing than do anything !
it s better than ice cream
it s better than springtime
but reverend mother everyone loves our new style
it s brought people back to the church
ice cream !
mary clarence you shouldn t have where did you get this ?
mary clarence ! sister !
it s no use she just isn t here
we can t sing without her ! what should we do ?
we will pray and she will be there
you mean they kidnapped her ?
yes two men and they had guns
an entertainer ?
she wasn t a nun ?
well i don t care who she is we can t sing without her !
she s our inspiration !
it s so beautiful
and what a lovely name las vegas
the little sisters of the moonlight !
but how do we get there ?
excuse me has anyone seen a nun ?
a benedictine
mary clarence you are alive !
christy
not a note
impossible
i don t understand where is she ?
her whereabouts are unknown and we must proceed without her pull yourselves together
las vegas she s here somewhere
but where ?
i mean won t she talk ? she seemed kind of upset
she did bring her back now for a talk
soon you gorgeous thing tell me how lonely ?
it s that call you were expecting vince
can you hold ? can you try ?
we both missed
okay so the problem is still the nun outfit right ?
where ?
find em !
if we could speak alone
this is not a time for frivolity katrina is it ? am i mistaken ?
excuse me gentlemen but who has seen this horseman ?
many have
then name one person who has seen him with their own eyes
hail constable how are you ?
well enough your gathering does honor to the deceased
certainly not
excuse me miss they have a laugh at your expense
we haven t heard your name yet friend
well unless your name is baltus you should not worry over mine
what the hell are you doing ?
you are the blacksmith ever shod a horse with a hoof this large ?
never a shoe that size i would have remembered
they spend two days in chains
two days ? for murder ?
why did you move the body doctor ?
to place it inside its coffin
we must be a curious sight to him
what are you spying on ?
the lenape he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time
he is a behemoth
a diseased monster
keep still constable you were half drowned when they found you
brom bones
he is dead you would be also if your wound had not somehow shut
bring young masbath here
you need to sleep
bring him
you need rest
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves
you will stay at her side ?
help yourself you pompous ass i will be in bed
would you stay doctor ? i may need assistance
stains of blood
what of it ?
it is sacrilege !
i cannot proceed without examining the previous victims
taken taken by the headless horseman taken back to hell
pardon me ?
do you have these persons wills ?
i have everything last testaments birth certificates death certificates deeds
yes sir but do you have these ?
may i see them master hardenbrook ?
hmm ? see them ?
may we look at them now ?
of course you want them it shall not take long wait here
maybe you should take this
a fine idea
damn damn damn
master hardenbrook
perhaps i could assist in finding them ?
well that might be helpful
just a moment if i may it is possible this man was murdered
he drowned anyone could see
there are surgical ways of telling how he died by the water in his lungs
he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health
i could determine if he were dead u before u he went into the hudson
must we again hear these heretical rantings ?
the widow windsor
is that all you say ? look at her
it s not something people speak of openly she did not remarry
found the body this morning you do believe now don t you ?
believe ?
listen to what you say
no you listen ! you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards
at times i do
what is the common thread between these victims ?
i am sure i don t know
we must discover it the reason the murderer chose these persons
where are we going ?
up
out there what do you see ?
the western woods
look again
are you familiar with magnets ?
what kind of nuts ?
not for eating i assure you watch here
it s spectacular

no crickets or cicadas calling no bird songs
we are leaving
what happened ?
what is it ?

we should go
why this tree ?
my father had farm land it was the only thing we owned of any value
and it now belongs to you according to baltus i heard him say it
yes
only the heirs were killed proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment
but if the farm is not mine who stole it away ?
no one yet far as i can tell it has gone intestate
in test what ?
intestate your farm all the farms they belong to no one
what does it mean ?
there is no masbath here my father s loan papers are missing
there are none for magistrate philipse either paasch james pieter thomas pos william

v ger is that which seeks the creator
the examination is a normal function
you may proceede
disclose the information
not until v ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet
kirk unit ! disclose the information !
kirk unit u why u do you not disclose information ?
because v ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet
they have repressed the creator
the information will not be disclosed
then v ger must withdraw its orbiting devices
v ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information
what does that mean ?
when my examination is complete the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns
does v ger object to the presence of the two carbon units ?
the carbon units are of no consequence v ger will determine their purpose
you said v ger s purpose was to find and join with the creator
that is how v ger will survive
and when v ger melds ? what will happen to you ?

the question is mr decker u is u there a next move
mr decker i will contact you every five minutes otherwise inform mr scott immediately
captain i d like to go along
we could have cut it off at the main computer

is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not
it appears that our message has been understood captain
any reply from them ?
recommend we proceede captain
mr decker ?
no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude
instruments fluctuating captain patterns unrecognizable
we cannot break free captain we do not have a fraction of the power necessary
delay that order scotty ! disengage all main drive systems !

perhaps i have captain perhaps i have
spock what is it ? do you know this vulcan ?
i cannot be certain
but he does seem familiar ?
he reminds me of someone i knew in my youth
he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors
why ?
he believed the key to self knowledge was emotion not logic
when he encouraged others to follow him he was banished from vulcan never to return
fascinating
their equipment is primitive but effective i recommend we land at coordinate 8563
that puts us pretty far away from paradise city
to land any closer would risk detection
mr sulu execute
at footspeed i estimate the journey to paradise city at 1 2 hours
we don t have 1 2 hours

it s not up to me
mom and dad said it s yours they seem to think you are coming home

a few billion bucks and suddenly he s cro magnon man of the year
it s so nice to have friends like you christy
she said peanuts you cretin
you never know around here
charlie s right jealousy is so unattractive
second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit
why can t you be nice to me ?
you ve got enough people kissing your ass
where are we going ?
to the best hiding place in the world
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade i am honing my craft
