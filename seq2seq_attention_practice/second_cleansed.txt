 mr oh ' s intern <eos>
 i don ' t know who he is but he used connections <eos>
 someone made it into an ivy league <eos>
 school by writing to the president <eos>
 the desperate reason why he had to get in moved him <eos>
 you know what happened ? <eos>
 he dropped out after a semester <eos>

 because he couldn ' t keep up <eos>
 he only has a ged and no experience <eos>
 how do you know ? <eos>

 he won ' t last long anyway <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 yes <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 i usually eat lunch alone <eos>
 i see <eos>
 and … <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 i heard you pulled it off <eos>
 you ' re really racing ahead of us <eos>
 i ' m jang baek ki <eos>
 resource team intern <eos>
 i ' m jang geu rae <eos>
 please excuse me <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 you joined late we started 10 days ago <eos>
 i see <eos>
 it … <eos>
 … just happened that way <eos>
 ask me if you have any questions <eos>
 like where the paper is … <eos>
 the whereabouts … <eos>
 you saw me <eos>
 you see everything here <eos>
 but they can ' t tend to it <eos>
 everyone ' s so busy <eos>
 yes i ' ve learned that <eos>
 but … <eos>
 … you must be nervous <eos>
 you can take off your jacket <eos>
 i forgot <eos>
 yes <eos>
 who is it for ma ' am ? <eos>
 how much is this new one ? <eos>
 $824 for the whole suit <eos>
 is that made with gold thread ? <eos>
 there ' s no difference from this <eos>
 the brand doesn ' t matter <eos>
 let ' s go for lunch <eos>
 what shall we have ? what shall we have ? <eos>
 pasta ? <eos>
 no way bean paste stew <eos>
 you always have that <eos>
 yes <eos>
 aren ' t you going for lunch ? <eos>
 oh i ' m not very hungry <eos>
 are you a mama ' s boy ? <eos>
 you can ' t do anything by yourself ? <eos>
 you can ' t eat alone or … <eos>
 i ' m not that stupid <eos>
 i ' m really not hungry <eos>
 i guess i ' m nervous <eos>
 come in <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 sorry no room <eos>
 go ahead <eos>
 it ' s him <eos>
 he must have great connections to have become an intern without a test <eos>
 he must have a great resume <eos>
 maybe he went to an ivy league school <eos>
 ivy league schools must be easy to get into <eos>
 anyway this is unfair <eos>
 it ' s not fair at all ! <eos>
 hopefully they won ' t give special treatment to fulltime employees <eos>
 young yi is already enough <eos>
 speak of the devil <eos>
 geu rae ! <eos>
 come on over <eos>
 bon appetite thanks <eos>
 i ' m kim seok ho in the team next to yours <eos>
 i ' m jang geu rae <eos>
 hi <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 come to our intern study group <eos>
 oh sure <eos>
 why would he join us ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 yes young yi doesn ' t come either <eos>
 no 1 ' s don ' t need study groups <eos>
 where did you go for college ? <eos>
 harvard ? stanford ? <eos>
 or maybe your family is rich ? <eos>
 i ' m a curious person you know <eos>
 i only have a ged <eos>
 that ' s shocking <eos>
 our company doesn ' t care about educational backgrounds ? <eos>
 you ' re late young yi <eos>
 hey hi <eos>
 today ' s kimchi stew is really good <eos>
 i ' ll have pollack stew <eos>
 so that ' s why he kept following her <eos>
 can i have a seat ? <eos>
 you eat well alone <eos>
 sorry about before <eos>
 sure <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 people usually say " it ' s ok " <eos>
 you say " sure " when no wrong was done <eos>
 i ' m so mad <eos>
 we studied so hard to make it in as interns <eos>
 we busted our behinds <eos>
 no baek ki ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 you ' re right <eos>
 to improve our resume <eos>
 you said so too <eos>
 you were a senior when we were freshmen right ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 a lot of us are from the same schools <eos>
 mr lee in it is from mine <eos>
 i wonder what his family is like <eos>
 he doesn ' t look all that rich <eos>
 anyway you can tell his face value <eos>
 do companies still have preferential hirings for the poor ? <eos>
 this may sound arrogant <eos>
 but i feel cheated <eos>
 why did i join a company that would hire someone like him ? <eos>
 maybe our school is a bit tough to get into but isn ' t this too much ? <eos>
 hey <eos>
 you are being arrogant alright <eos>
 just treat him well <eos>
 he can ' t stay here much longer <eos>
 there ' s no position for him <eos>
 but i feel so cheated <eos>
 we really busted our behinds <eos>
 cheers ! <eos>
 there ' s no position for him <eos>
 a road opens as you travel along <eos>
 a road that doesn ' t open isn ' t a road <eos>
 roads are open to everyone <eos>
 but not everyone can have the roads <eos>
 you didn ' t think it ' s because of this ? <eos>
 i mean the reason you keep failing the contest with your great skill <eos>
 master <eos>
 quit your parttime job <eos>
 i know you ' re poor and your dad is sick <eos>
 but you can ' t make it like this <eos>
 this is your last year as a korea go club student <eos>
 it ' ll be harder for you if you don ' t make it this year either <eos>
 so quit your job geu rae <eos>
 my road ended there <eos>
 it ' s not because i lacked skills or luck <eos>
 or because i had a parttime job on the side <eos>
 or because my parents couldn ' t support me <eos>
 or because my mom became bedridden <eos>
 after my dad passed away <eos>
 that would be too painful <eos>
 so i want to think i didn ' t work hard enough <eos>
 i want to think that way even if it isn ' t true <eos>
 i ended up here because i didn ' t work hard <eos>
 i was abandoned because i didn ' t work hard <eos>
 you ' ll have to wear that one more day <eos>
 i was too busy to buy one <eos>
 take your time <eos>
 why are your eyes red ? <eos>
 i couldn ' t sleep because of you <eos>
 you were tossing and turning all night <eos>
 i couldn ' t sleep because of your snoring <eos>

 i ' m out in the world because i didn ' t work hard <eos>
 i was abandoned because i didn ' t work hard <eos>
 i ' m here right now because <eos>
 i didn ' t work hard <eos>
 i wanted to prove <eos>
 a categorization standard and efficient application <eos>
 a method to kill two birds with one stone <eos>
 and above all else … <eos>
 … prove it to myself <eos>
 hello <eos>

 do you know of any cleaners around here ? <eos>

 geu rae that ' s the company ' s manual <eos>
 you know what that means ? <eos>
 everyone understood and agreed <eos>
 if there ' s an issue because of what you did <eos>
 should they ask you about it ? <eos>
 you don ' t work alone <eos>
 i don ' t know how long you ' ll work here <eos>
 but keep that in mind while you ' re here <eos>
 " you don ' t work alone " <eos>
 different individuals nationalities beginning middle final phases … <eos>
 different eras people old and new … <eos>
 it was for my little world <eos>
 good morning <eos>
 here … <eos>
 … i don ' t work … <eos>
 … alone <eos>
 thanks to you the results were great <eos>
 of course thanks <eos>
 keep in touch <eos>
 things going ok ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 what are you doing this weekend ? nothing much <eos>
 let ' s go hiking with the executive director <eos>
 i forgot about an alumni gathering <eos>
 does that mean you don ' t want to change ? <eos>
 i told you you have to go high to see far <eos>
 i told him about … <eos>
 i ' ll … <eos>
 … ask my friends to go hiking <eos>
 ok <eos>
 excuse me <eos>
 hiking is hiking and work is work <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 what ' s with you when i told you to set the meeting ages ago ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 you want to be fired ? <eos>
 you think we can ' t fire interns ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry ! <eos>
 geez ! <eos>
 mr hwang teach him well ! <eos>
 gosh ! <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 breathe ! <eos>
 why are you so worked up ? <eos>
 every intern gets to you huh ? <eos>
 calm down <eos>
 you shouldn ' t have given him that duty <eos>
 he ' s been sitting around when i told <eos>
 him to set the meeting ages ago ! <eos>
 he ' s thorough <eos>
 i guess i can ' t be as miserable as you <eos>
 thanks for understanding <eos>
 so you heard ? <eos>
 you knew it all along ? <eos>
 i heard this morning <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you know who his connection is ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 who is it ? who got him in ? <eos>
 who ? <eos>
 the executive director <eos>
 why didn ' t you tell him what the problem was ? <eos>
 what for ? <eos>
 he won ' t be here long <eos>
 that was too much yesterday <eos>
 something stinks <eos>
 it ' s octopus <eos>
 you didn ' t go home yesterday ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 did you finish your work ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 you should ' ve just gone home <eos>
 i have to decide on my presentation partner <eos>
 it ' s by tomorrow right ? <eos>
 you ' ll find a partner for the interview <eos>
 or maybe not <eos>
 the individual presentations are a bigger issue <eos>
 so much work <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 see you later geu rae <eos>
 i ' ll get going too <eos>
 that makes me feel weird <eos>
 i feel i shouldn ' t let that happen to me <eos>
 that ' ll happen if we don ' t pass the final presentation interview <eos>
 then what should i do ? <eos>
 what do we have to do to avoid that ? <eos>
 i was just kidding <eos>
 being an intern at one international isn ' t everything <eos>
 there are tons of jobs out there <eos>
 anyway you ' ll have to find a partner <eos>
 you can ' t do it by yourself <eos>
 everyone ' s talking about ' working alone ' today <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 here ok <eos>
 categorize it by the alphabet and nations <eos>
 doublecheck the costs too <eos>
 look geu rae <eos>
 the executive director got him in <eos>
 he should have gotten someone smarter <eos>
 i don’t think he put him on your team with ulterior motives <eos>
 he wouldn ' t have done it to keep an eye on you <eos>
 what are you to him ? <eos>
 he could ' ve done it to give you trouble <eos>
 but he ' s not that childish <eos>
 even if he hates you <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i think he dumped him on your team since he was in a pickle <eos>
 dong sik yes <eos>
 is the report ready for the department manager ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 geu rae yes <eos>
 is it ready ? yes it is <eos>
 he knows how to work with excel <eos>
 i asked him to try checking by cost and nation <eos>
 what are you doing man ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 why ' d you ask him ? <eos>
 get your act together <eos>
 you asked him to try ? <eos>
 you think this is practice ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 finish it by 2pm <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 go for lunch <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 is everything ok ? <eos>
 you have no friends huh ? <eos>
 it looks like a diary for yourself <eos>
 they said we don’t work alone <eos>
 why ' d you ask him ? <eos>
 get your act together <eos>
 but they ' re forcing me to be alone <eos>
 you asked him to try ? <eos>
 you think this is practice ? <eos>
 he didn ' t want to teach me anyway <eos>
 what do you mean " you don ' t work alone " ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 what was that ? <eos>
 there were only 3 types for summer <eos>
 yes i didn ' t know what you wanted <eos>
 so i ' m bringing all of them <eos>
 i ' m on my way up <eos>
 bye <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 here <eos>
 it ' s ok i ' ll carry it <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 1 because it ' s heavy 2 because it ' s heavy <eos>
 3 because it ' s heavy <eos>
 did you decide on your partner ? <eos>
 oh right when is that due ? <eos>
 come on it ' s by tomorrow <eos>
 i haven ' t decided yet either <eos>
 what about the others ? <eos>
 they ' ll probably struggle not to be the odd one out <eos>
 i ' m here now <eos>
 yes <eos>
 to mr oh ? <eos>
 ok <eos>
 dong sik yes <eos>
 let ' s start with the cambodia case <eos>
 ok <eos>
 sorry but can you bring this to mr mun ? <eos>
 sure <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 i brought the samples <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 did you decide on your partner ? <eos>
 not yet <eos>
 i was rejected by baek ki just now <eos>
 i didn’t even ask but he won ' t be my partner <eos>
 he ' s smart huh ? <eos>
 anyway find a good partner or you ' ll be ruined <eos>
 i don ' t care who my partner is <eos>
 you ' re that confident ? <eos>
 it ' s not that <eos>
 prepare well and pass <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 they ' re pathetic huh ? <eos>
 not you the people who left this here <eos>
 oh okay <eos>
 i don ' t care who my partner is <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 be my partner <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 you said you don ' t care who it was <eos>
 i ' ll do my best for both of us <eos>
 geu rae ? <eos>
 is there something on my face ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 sorry <eos>
 i was thinking about something <eos>
 you were totally staring at me <eos>
 here <eos>
 i forgot to give it to you <eos>
 maybe i should ' ve just asked <eos>
 anyway you ' ll have to find a partner <eos>
 you can ' t do it by yourself <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 i looked everywhere for you <eos>
 it had totally slipped my mind … <eos>
 have you decided on your partner yet ? <eos>
 be my partner <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 let ' s be a good team <eos>
 what ' s this ? <eos>
 geu rae yes <eos>
 hello <eos>
 here <eos>
 i see you skipped lunch <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 have you decided on your partner yet ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 ok <eos>
 what the ? <eos>
 give it to me <eos>
 it ' s ok … <eos>
 partner <eos>
 what ' s all this ? <eos>
 you ' re popular <eos>
 hold on please <eos>
 yes by the 18th <eos>
 ok <eos>
 18th … <eos>
 how come no one ' s asking ? <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 you don ' t have your partner yet right ? <eos>
 be my partner <eos>
 i ' m saving you <eos>
 no one wants to be your partner <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 it ' s obvious <eos>
 you ' re so good <eos>
 teamwork is key and you ' ll totally stand out alone <eos>
 i haven ' t decided yet either <eos>
 let ' s do it <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 let ' s have a cup of coffee <eos>
 partner ? <eos>
 yes i was too busy so i couldn ' t decide yet <eos>
 but i ' m … i have a lot to learn too <eos>
 let ' s work hard together <eos>
 to gether … <eos>
 i have a lot to learn too <eos>
 let ' s work hard together <eos>
 team ? <eos>
 we ' re a team ? <eos>
 let ' s do it <eos>
 let ' s work hard together <eos>
 geu rae yes <eos>
 are you done proofreading ? <eos>
 yes i ' m almost done <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 let ' s have a talk <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 did you decide on your partner ? huh ? <eos>
 why are you blushing like that ? <eos>
 nothing <eos>
 gee <eos>
 everyone wants you don ' t they ? <eos>
 i don ' t know why but … <eos>
 you have everything the other interns want in a partner <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 no confidence no comprehension skills or talent <eos>
 but why do they all want me ? <eos>
 it ' d be great if both members of a team got good results <eos>
 but if it ' s impossible <eos>
 it ' d be smart to choose a loser <eos>
 did you say " loser " ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 he would make the other person look good <eos>
 they ' ll stand out to the judges <eos>
 that ' s why they want you <eos>
 be careful of who approaches you <eos>
 so that was it <eos>
 familiar places i ' d visit <eos>
 after my overnight parttime job <eos>
 their faces clothing and directions <eos>
 were all the opposite of mine <eos>
 i ' d never mixed with students <eos>
 or company employees <eos>
 i wanted to be one of them so desperately <eos>
 that i couldn ' t see the ugly truth <eos>
 i was still going the different direction <eos>
 i ' m alone here too <eos>
 only <eos>
 i didn ' t know that truth <eos>
 when everyone else did <eos>
 all this chaos in order … <eos>
 i wonder … <eos>
 … would it ever be possible to have an agreement ? <eos>
 i have a lot to learn too <eos>
 let ' s work hard together <eos>
 where are you going during work ? <eos>
 didn ' t you hear me ? <eos>
 i ' m alone <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 so there ' s nothing i can do <eos>
 what did you say ? <eos>
 you said i can ' t work alone <eos>
 i mean the company work <eos>
 you asked me if i had friends <eos>
 that it looked like a personal diary <eos>
 you were right <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i had to do it alone <eos>
 i had to be fine alone <eos>
 and take responsibility alone <eos>
 what … so i don ' t know anything but alone <eos>
 so … <eos>
 … would you teach me <eos>
 give me a chance <eos>
 you need skills for that <eos>
 what do you mean ? <eos>
 you know <eos>
 no i don ' t <eos>
 if it ' s because of my educa … <eos>
 do you know how hard these people worked <eos>
 just to get into the lobby ? <eos>
 all their sweat and tears just to stay here ? <eos>
 we ' re in a corrupted world where those <eos>
 who lack the basics get on the escalator with lines <eos>
 i guess it can ' t be helped <eos>
 but … <eos>
 … i don ' t support that world yet <eos>
 sweat tears and frustration <eos>
 how much more should i shed ? <eos>
 crazy <eos>
 crazy <eos>

 why do you want me as your partner ? <eos>
 i started a week earlier than the other interns <eos>

 it ' s good for the planning stage <eos>
 you ' re soooooooooooo much better than the others <eos>

 sir ! <eos>
 is it what the executive director wants ? <eos>
 it was always like that <eos>
 even on the way to the goacademy in the crack of dawn <eos>
 even when i came home after my late night parttime job <eos>
 there were people outside no matter what time i start my day <eos>
 i thought people would still be sleeping <eos>
 but as always … <eos>
 … the world is faster than me <eos>
 the documents are ready sir <eos>

 why did you change your mind ? <eos>
 no i haven ' t <eos>
 i just delayed my decision <eos>
 i ' ll ask you this time <eos>
 why me ? <eos>
 i think your experience on the field will help our presentation <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 what do you think the life is ? <eos>
 you think it ' s a big question ? it ' s simple <eos>
 a collection of your choices is your life <eos>
 the choices you make in each moment … <eos>
 … makes up the quality of your life <eos>
 five minutes have passed since we came up this rooftop <eos>

 these five minutes … <eos>

 … best lifechanging five minutes for you <eos>
 that dog ? <eos>
 that obnoxious dog ? <eos>
 that arrogant dog ? <eos>
 the dog with the bob ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 i understand that ' s his nickname <eos>
 but why is suk yool called that ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 because he is a dog <eos>
 he comes an hour earlier to work to look at girls <eos>
 the two of bomb will make nuclear bomb <eos>
 let ' s see who explodes first <eos>
 i can ' t wait <eos>
 we ' ll have to choose an item first <eos>
 i ' ll leave it all to you <eos>
 just share the progress through email <eos>
 you want me to decide on the item by myself ? <eos>

 it ' s a good morning <eos>
 good morning <eos>
 didn ' t the executive director reject this ? <eos>
 i ' ll change the conditions <eos>
 but he told you not to do it last time <eos>
 so i ' ll do it again changing the conditions <eos>
 mr oh … <eos>
 he rejected it once <eos>
 also it costs a lot <eos>
 that ' s why i want to do it <eos>
 would i do it if it didn ' t ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 you ' re sharp <eos>
 at the start of the day <eos>
 why does he mess up my hair ? <eos>
 you could teach me <eos>
 give me a chance <eos>
 you need to be qualified for chances <eos>
 what do you mean ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 if you ' re done call a dispatch rider <eos>
 sure <eos>
 get out punk ! <eos>
 you get it now ? <eos>
 why you don ' t get a chance ? <eos>
 why you ' re not qualified ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 there are documents in the cabinet from 3 years ago <eos>
 find the complaints regarding the osung ' s fertilizer case <eos>
 also find that year ' s <eos>
 mou and contracts too <eos>
 osung … <eos>
 contract … <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 what else ? <eos>
 trying to interpret that <eos>
 trade dictionary ? <eos>
 even if i ' m fast you should catch it <eos>
 i don ' t have high hopes <eos>
 so at least act like you ' re trying <eos>
 to understand me while you ' re here <eos>
 you ' re driving me nuts <eos>

 young yi ! <eos>
 let ' s not worry too much about the item <eos>
 and just receive something from my club seniors <eos>
 club seniors ? <eos>
 mmhmm <eos>
 let ' s go to the lounge <eos>
 mr lee <eos>
 sorry sorry <eos>
 i ' m just so close with my female juniors <eos>
 aren ' t you overreacting ? <eos>
 as if i sexually assaulted you or something <eos>
 mr lee <eos>
 i was told to be careful of women when working <eos>
 you can become so scary <eos>
 come to the lounge <eos>
 how to choose the resources ? <eos>
 mmhmm <eos>
 my senior works in ulsan <eos>
 he got hired with this item <eos>
 they won ' t know it <eos>
 we can tweak it a bit … <eos>
 mr lee <eos>
 i have other seniors too <eos>
 so there are lots of material <eos>
 you don ' t have much to do at all <eos>
 no <eos>
 i like not having much to do <eos>
 but not old stuff it ' s no good <eos>
 geez <eos>
 why go through all the trouble ? <eos>
 you ' re so uptight <eos>
 geez <eos>
 what ' s wrong ? <eos>
 not feeling well ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 sit down and relax <eos>
 you were busy running about today <eos>
 i ' m good <eos>
 come on <eos>
 it ' s your boss ' s order not mine <eos>
 i met him at the 1st floor café <eos>
 he wants to make up for working you like a dog with a $4 coffee <eos>
 they ' ll tell us the 2nd presentation assignment the day before <eos>
 it ' ll be tough if we have lots of work <eos>
 i wonder how geu rae ' s doing <eos>
 i get suk yool <eos>
 i don ' t understand why geu rae chose him <eos>
 when he had so many choices <eos>
 so many choices ? <eos>
 didn ' t you know ? <eos>
 they must ' ve thought he ' d help them stand out <eos>
 they wanted to use geu rae <eos>
 i must ' ve thought that too <eos>
 76% <eos>
 the copies <eos>
 hand them out <eos>
 sure <eos>
 the overseas market is 29% <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 work harder <eos>
 let ' s do it <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 see you tomorrow <eos>
 what ' s a container crane ? <eos>
 container handling gantry crane or shiptoshore … <eos>
 telegraphic transfer ? <eos>
 exchange rate when electronic means of transferring funds overseas <eos>
 we just need to make the orders to ulsan <eos>
 i ' m surprised the manager approved it <eos>
 i wonder if the executive director said anything <eos>
 make sure not to make any mistakes so they can ' t pick on you <eos>
 there won ' t any problems since we ' ve been on this <eos>
 we ' re just tight on time <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 check the vietnamese case info <eos>
 the loading discharging rates and df … <eos>
 that won ' t be in the dictionary <eos>
 we use that term here <eos>
 i know <eos>
 aren ' t you talking about dispatch fees ? <eos>
 the fee that ships pay for putting it there when they can ' t load and unload <eos>
 can i check after i make these copies ? <eos>
 huh ? go ahead <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 did you tell him ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 maybe he ' s a genius <eos>
 he memorized the dictionary in 3 days <eos>
 look at him prepare the presentation item too <eos>
 oh my gosh <eos>
 although he might not know what he ' s doing <eos>
 yeah that ' s important <eos>
 i wonder if he knows what he ' s doing <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 do you honestly want him to make it or not ? <eos>
 want my honest opinion ? <eos>
 why get so serious ? <eos>
 i honestly want him to fail <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 again … <eos>
 what is it this time ? <eos>
 it ' s not sexy <eos>
 do it again with something else that ' s sexy <eos>
 geez <eos>
 hi geu rae <eos>
 why this time ? <eos>
 didn ' t you get my text ? <eos>
 are you kidding me ? <eos>
 you don’t get me <eos>
 things have changed <eos>
 " sexy " doesn ' t only refer to sexual appeal <eos>
 something … <eos>
 … with an edge <eos>
 you probably don’t get that either <eos>
 good partners would get each other right away <eos>
 you ' re inflexible and conservative aren ' t you ? <eos>
 you must not be able to adjust to fast changing trend quickly <eos>
 that ' s not the issue <eos>
 it ' s not ? <eos>
 then what ' s the problem ? <eos>
 that ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 that ' s no good for the item <eos>
 i ' ve won many awards … <eos>
 didn ' t you say i could do whatever i want ? <eos>
 i asked you to share it <eos>
 i said i ' d do my share <eos>
 so i have to do whatever you ask me ? <eos>
 geu rae i know what i ' m doing <eos>
 also i ' m what the company needs <eos>
 who do you think should listen to who ? <eos>
 i ' m not saying i ' m better than you <eos>
 i ' m giving you good advice <eos>
 then … <eos>
 … what kind of item should it be ? <eos>
 you find it something you ' re good at <eos>
 and something sexy <eos>
 i ' m in seoul for work shall i go in ? <eos>
 no it ' s ok <eos>
 ok call me when you ' re ready <eos>
 unsexy = tooooo plain <eos>
 why that … <eos>
 that bomb exploded first <eos>
 hello <eos>

 that ' s the only place for veggie wraps <eos>
 it ' s gross <eos>
 they ' re good for you though <eos>
 he ' s sleeping <eos>

 he has tons of presentation items on his desk <eos>
 he ' s preparing alone ? who ' s his partner ? <eos>
 the guy in ulsan suk yool <eos>
 the slacker ? <eos>

 looks like geu rae is doing all of the work <eos>
 so the slacker and clueless guy met <eos>
 true <eos>

 we need to hurry and decide on the item <eos>
 ok ok <eos>
 nagging me nonstop … <eos>
 i ' m sorry ! <eos>
 sorry <eos>

 don ' t go <eos>
 hi sang hyun <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 i have to go meet my club senior <eos>
 let ' s postpone our evening meeting to tomorrow <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 i ' ll bring a lot of materials <eos>
 uh … sang hyun <eos>
 do whatever you want <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 they ' re not cutting us any slack for the presentation <eos>
 they want us to pull it all off <eos>
 same with your team ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 my partner is giving me trouble too <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 you saw how stubborn he was last time <eos>
 i thought i ' d just have to do my part … <eos>
 … whoever became my partner <eos>
 i preferred someone i could communicate with <eos>
 i just wanted to let you know <eos>
 i didn ' t have ulterior motives in mind that you think <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 no <eos>
 no need to apologize <eos>
 you can do that after you pass <eos>
 anything fun to share ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yes ? <eos>
 you shouldn ' t be sitting here now <eos>
 your team seems to have an issue <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 that was just a verbal contract … <eos>
 but … <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i ' ll try to find a solution <eos>
 yes bye <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i told you to check it a million times ! <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 never mind <eos>
 i approved it so it ' s my responsibility <eos>
 no i … <eos>
 follow me <eos>
 you never make mistakes <eos>
 i know you had a lot on your plate but <eos>
 … i told you many times <eos>
 you and i are on this project so we need to do well <eos>
 actually i should ' ve checked the fta conditions <eos>
 seok ho <eos>
 yes <eos>
 do you know what ' s going on in my team ? <eos>
 it is a big mess <eos>
 mr kim ' s fine fiber duster export case <eos>
 the buyer asked them to meet the fta conditions now <eos>
 they just mentioned it during the <eos>
 verbal contract and mr kim missed it <eos>
 he didn ' t think too much about it as it was before fta took effect <eos>
 as far as i know the ship leaves tomorrow <eos>
 exactly but they won ' t budge <eos>
 they ' ll annul the contract if it ' s not <eos>
 fulfilled within the appointed date <eos>
 if we make cancellations and rebook can we make the contract date ? <eos>
 rebook ? <eos>
 then the ship … <eos>
 we have ships with quick arrival times <eos>
 after all procedures and if we ' re lucky to get a quick ship … <eos>
 get a ship first <eos>
 or even air transport <eos>
 then the cost will … <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 that ' s not the issue here <eos>
 yes <eos>
 come in <eos>
 i ' ll get it fixed within 3 days <eos>
 with the air fee storage and booking cancellation charge … <eos>
 what will you do about the cost ? <eos>
 preventing the contract annulment is the priority here <eos>
 for trust in the future <eos>
 you ' re aware of that and you created this mess ? <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 get your stuff <eos>
 let ' s go down right away <eos>
 ok <eos>
 get the documents on the way <eos>
 i got the containers put in storage <eos>
 if we go now which one can we catch ? <eos>
 that … <eos>
 i made reservations since the earliest is an hour later <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 ok <eos>
 mr oh i ' ll … <eos>
 just do whatever you were doing <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i wish i can do whatever i was doing <eos>
 thanks to this jerk <eos>
 to our youth ! <eos>
 with all our energy ! <eos>
 geez <eos>
 there ' s not enough material <eos>
 some are from china indonesia and taiwan <eos>
 we need to make all the documents <eos>
 it ' ll be more complicated than we think <eos>
 are the chinese documents ready ? <eos>
 they must be there somewhere <eos>
 we ' ll have to search <eos>
 i think i ' ll have to check the storage and look at the documents myself <eos>
 i ' ll send a fax <eos>
 ok <eos>
 what about the rest ? <eos>
 mr hwang will call me <eos>
 leave the importer request <eos>
 i left it on your desk <eos>
 dang <eos>
 i ' ll ask geu rae to … <eos>
 no we have tons to do here so tell him to bring it down <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 why that … <eos>
 please leave a message after … <eos>
 hey suk yool ! <eos>

 hello <eos>
 mr oh <eos>

 yes there ' s one <eos>
 we just need the certificate of origin in time <eos>

 ok <eos>

 ok <eos>
 this way <eos>
 what ' s he doing ? <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 oh my ! <eos>
 you pervert <eos>
 wait <eos>
 i touched it already so i ' ll touch it once more <eos>
 is he psycho ? <eos>
 geu rae ! <eos>
 the site you were talking about … <eos>
 is where you act like a pervert ? <eos>
 my skin is tender like a baby <eos>
 why won ' t you check the item ? <eos>
 i was on my way to check it <eos>
 what brings you here ? <eos>
 i sent three <eos>
 hurry up and check them <eos>
 three ? <eos>
 look geu rae <eos>
 i wrote 20 pages for a single item at the company i interned at <eos>
 yet you found three in a week ? <eos>
 it ' s not that easy <eos>
 just check it <eos>
 come on <eos>
 look geu rae <eos>
 i ' ll do it again if i have to <eos>
 if you ' re dumb you have to put in more legwork <eos>
 succeed with quantity ? <eos>
 no way <eos>
 forty pages ? <eos>
 fortytwo pages ? <eos>
 unbelievable <eos>
 he thinks this is a love letter ? <eos>
 fiftythree pages ? <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 you should be on your toes <eos>
 you ought to concentrate <eos>
 geez <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 want a massage ? <eos>
 stop it ! <eos>
 you ' re so weird <eos>
 how ' s the presentation coming along ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 you never asked me before <eos>
 our presentation preparations … <eos>
 alright <eos>
 fax <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 it came <eos>
 we just need to send it to the company with the number now <eos>
 then i ' ll go to seoul and prepare the rest <eos>
 see you in seoul <eos>
 did it go well ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes ? <eos>
 what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 let ' s talk <eos>
 i have a question <eos>
 have you been conned before ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 they ' re not helpful at all <eos>
 saps morale … <eos>
 are you talking about yourself ? <eos>
 about suk yool … <eos>
 his motives are strong <eos>
 if you ' re incompetent he ' ll look good <eos>
 even if you ' re competent he ' ll use that … <eos>
 … to look good <eos>
 i see <eos>
 his motives are like a tornado <eos>
 he gives others damage or trouble <eos>
 the center is calm though <eos>
 aim for the center <eos>
 did you see them ? <eos>
 i heard you ' re here with mr oh because of a team mistake <eos>
 how are the items ? <eos>
 this is all i did there ' s so much to do <eos>
 what did you think ? <eos>
 well … <eos>
 again ? <eos>
 let ' s go with the second item <eos>
 are you sure ? <eos>
 yes but … <eos>
 then that ' s it <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 we decided on the item together <eos>
 you ' re experienced and you shouldn ' t <eos>
 suffer any loses because of me <eos>
 you agreed on the item so we ' re set <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 i ' ll create the presentation details <eos>
 so it ' s beneficial for me <eos>
 i ' ll share the data but i won ' t accept support <eos>
 as promised <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 the world of go is always a war <eos>
 and … <eos>
 … sometimes you retreat when approached … <eos>
 … or try to survive together <eos>
 but the winner and loser are clear <eos>
 how old are you ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 i lived in that world for over a decade <eos>
 over the years … <eos>
 … my focus on winning has grown even i ' m a loser now <eos>
 i ' m a pro at it <eos>
 we took care of the team ' s mistake <eos>
 the certificate of origin was sent in time and the forwarding agent … <eos>
 a forwarding agent is a company that organizes shipments for others <eos>
 according to the trade term dictionary <eos>
 it was sent to the forwarding agent <eos>
 and a ship was successfully sent off in ulsan <eos>
 and a few days later … <eos>
 … he came <eos>
 disciplinary committee ? <eos>
 i know <eos>
 just because there were some extra fees ? <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 i know <eos>
 it doesn ' t usually happen <eos>
 if it happens he ' ll probably get demoted <eos>
 must you do this to the young kid ? <eos>
 so why redo the item the executive director rejected ? <eos>
 so it was the executive director ' s idea ? <eos>
 he had his reasons for rejecting it <eos>
 you were playing smart about it <eos>
 when you redid it you were telling him you were risking your everything <eos>
 sir ! <eos>
 you should ' ve done well in the first place ! <eos>
 why screw up ? <eos>
 the committee is reviewing it so just wait <eos>
 mr oh … <eos>
 i ' ll look into it too <eos>
 do your work <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 if you learned about trading contracts work on that <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr oh … <eos>
 do your work <eos>
 i ' ll take the discipline <eos>
 what else can you do ? <eos>
 please leave a message after … <eos>
 i heard the disciplinary committee is on mr kim … <eos>
 he knows everything <eos>
 i know everything huh ? <eos>
 you need to be quick with acquiring info <eos>
 he ' s great at guessing too <eos>
 i didn ' t guess <eos>
 i ' m good at reading minds <eos>
 i ' m an expert … <eos>
 … especially with girls ' minds <eos>
 he ' s crazy <eos>
 culture and trade nice <eos>
 change the title <eos>
 people need different things depending on the culture <eos>
 culture … <eos>
 wait <eos>
 what does " mentality trapped in culture " mean ? <eos>
 i just happened to write that … <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 you don ' t think of our presentation as a primary school essay do you ? <eos>
 these incomprehensible sentences will just do us harm <eos>
 if you had to interpret it … <eos>
 for example … <eos>
 " would chicks in hot countries like cosmetics ? " <eos>
 " of course not and they don’t sell well " <eos>
 that ' s what you meant by " mentality trapped in culture " ? <eos>
 then think about this <eos>
 there ' s bp fiber <eos>
 it has low durability and thermal resistance <eos>
 so it ' s bad for regular clothing <eos>
 so should we throw it out ? <eos>
 think ! <eos>
 have you done some thinking ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 this fiber has low thermal conductivity <eos>
 what ' s that ? <eos>
 it ' s … <eos>
 that ' s it ! it doesn’t absorb moisture <eos>
 what ' s that ? <eos>
 fast dry ! will you concentrate ? <eos>
 we can sell it in cold countries but what about other issues … <eos>
 this is why you need me <eos>
 the power of experience <eos>
 i ' d sell long johns in cold countries <eos>
 to people trapped in the culture of the cold climate <eos>
 i caught that but you wrote it without any thought <eos>
 that ' s being " trapped in culture " <eos>
 what do you think ? <eos>
 you can just trust me ok ? <eos>
 i ' d sell long johns in cold countries <eos>
 to people trapped in the culture of the cold climate <eos>
 i didn ' t think that far <eos>
 this is why you need me <eos>
 the power of experience <eos>
 is there no other way ? <eos>
 mr kim is competent <eos>
 you know that sir <eos>
 i ' m responsible for what happened <eos>
 it was just a mistake … <eos>
 yes sir yes <eos>
 please do what you can sir <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 bye <eos>
 what happened ? <eos>
 mr kwon is eloquent but he ' s in russia <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 just go talk … <eos>
 … to the executive director <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what do you mean what ? <eos>
 why don ' t you take the shortcut ? <eos>
 you know all he has to do <eos>
 is put in a word <eos>
 mr ko ! <eos>
 the executive director … <eos>
 yeah i know things aren ' t cool between you two <eos>
 you need to swallow your pride this time <eos>
 the executive director ? <eos>
 ok forget it don ' t go <eos>
 dong sik will just get a pay cut … <eos>
 … and sent to the factory <eos>
 he ' ll just have to sacrifice a promotion <eos>
 yeah your pride is more important than your subordinate <eos>
 i ' ll be the only one who knows you didn ' t do your best <eos>
 why should i care about your team ? <eos>
 what a pain in the neck <eos>
 you know all he has to do is put in a word <eos>
 yeah i know things aren ' t cool between you two <eos>
 you need to swallow your pride this time <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 did mr oh come back ? <eos>
 he said he ' d return soon <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 then i ' ll go to kotra <eos>
 ok <eos>
 see you <eos>
 bye <eos>
 bye <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 let ' s go submit the presentation files we can go now <eos>
 hello <eos>
 jang geu rae and han suk yool <eos>
 it ' s tomorrow finally <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 i thought about it <eos>
 let ' s wrap it up in a sexier way <eos>
 let ' s end it with a question <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you don ' t understand ? <eos>
 i said " sexy " means " uncommon " <eos>
 not something everyone else does <eos>
 we should end it with a meaningful question <eos>
 an interview should convey … <eos>
 that ' s what i ' m saying <eos>
 you can infer his opinion through the question <eos>
 so frustrating <eos>
 let ' s think about the question <eos>
 refer to some books <eos>
 sure <eos>
 ask me questions if any <eos>
 sure <eos>
 if you still need … <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 hello <eos>
 i didn ' t get the meeting briefing <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 i ' ll submit it soon <eos>
 soon ? <eos>
 how many times did i tell you not to <eos>
 let the presentation disturb your work ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 you getting disregarded looks natural <eos>
 why just say " sure sure " like that ? <eos>
 are you dumb or do you lack will power ? <eos>
 you told me to get into the center of the tornado <eos>
 because the center is calm <eos>
 i could suffer damage next to him <eos>
 didn ' t you mean i should get inside if i can ' t move far away ? <eos>
 although he makes me mad <eos>
 i realized i need him <eos>
 i have to acknowledge him <eos>

 geu rae <eos>

 i ' m sorry <eos>
 did you practice reading it ? <eos>

 practice it like you ' re making an announcement <eos>
 it ' s different from just reading it to yourself <eos>
 when you ' re nervous your breathing shakes <eos>
 if you speak louder for others … <eos>
 … you ' ll be out of breath <eos>
 don ' t just rely on the mic <eos>
 that ' s tougher <eos>
 listen to your tense breath on the speakers <eos>
 that ' ll make you even more nervous <eos>
 if you time yourself it would be good too <eos>
 listen to your tense breath on the speakers <eos>
 that ' ll make you even more nervous <eos>

 so ? <eos>
 will you shorten it if it ' s too long ? <eos>
 we can ' t do that <eos>
 i already memorized it <eos>
 we can ' t change … <eos>
 that will mess everything up <eos>
 we already submitted the slides <eos>
 hey ! <eos>

 isn ' t it good to find issues beforehand ? <eos>
 mr oh … <eos>
 mr oh … <eos>
 the guy who ' s putting his responsibility on subordinates ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 why should he get in trouble for that ? <eos>
 what happened to your team … <eos>
 … is all mr oh ' s fault <eos>
 we all know that <eos>
 are you done ? <eos>
 he comes and messes up all the files at our factory <eos>
 how could a pro do that ? <eos>
 i can ' t treat him like a boss <eos>
 blood … <eos>
 i told you to watch what you say <eos>
 what do you know about my boss ? <eos>

 geu rae and suk yool <eos>
 suk yool <eos>

 episode 4 <eos>
 sell something to the last guy <eos>
 ? i want to sell it to ? <eos>
 i heard you were looking for me <eos>
 you have something to say ? <eos>
 i have a favor to ask you about my team <eos>
 favor ? <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 regarding kim dong sik and the disciplinary committee <eos>
 please reconsider it <eos>
 please <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 unbelievable <eos>
 the individual presentation is about revealing yourself <eos>
 through your partner whether in a good way or bad way <eos>
 if i accept my partner ' s suggestion it ' ll only make him good <eos>
 if i refuse it ' ll make me look like so petty <eos>
 but ? <eos>
 geu rae you know me <eos>
 i won ' t buy anything you sell me <eos>
 i won ' t no matter what <eos>
 i won ' t buy anything <eos>
 this jerk doesn ' t care about his pettiness at all <eos>
 what should i do ? <eos>
 after the presentation topic was announced <eos>
 we haven ' t been able to leave work <eos>
 all the data is at work <eos>
 and we can also see our other ' s process <eos>
 some are already reading catalogues on items that ' d motivate your imagination <eos>
 please let me think like an elementary school student <eos>
 some surf the net to see if anything had anything similar <eos>
 hi <eos>
 you know someone who was in the same club as my partner right ? <eos>
 some people use their connections <eos>
 i can ' t treat him like a boss <eos>
 does he value site experience ? <eos>
 or does he hate office work ? <eos>
 doesn ' t site work start from the office ? <eos>
 young yi ! <eos>

 young yi ! <eos>
 sang hyun <eos>

 just a few months ' paycut doesn ' t ? <eos>
 ? mean i ' d be fired <eos>
 who care if i ' m promoted a bit later ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 just say " sorry thank you " <eos>
 i know how much you hate to ask him for favors <eos>
 i don ' t know why i didn ' t check the verbal contract one more time <eos>
 i ' m going nuts because i was aware of it <eos>
 that ' s why it ' s a mistake <eos>
 if you make the same mistake again that ' s the limit of yourself <eos>
 i know <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 also i ' m sorry <eos>
 hi <eos>

 site work is completed in the office <eos>
 your product info is in this document <eos>
 i need your signature here <eos>

 so <eos>
 i ' ll sell this pen which you can sign off the paper with <eos>
 it ' s lacking <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 it ' s lacking <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 you sound too desperate <eos>
 it ' s not persuasive <eos>
 i thought you left for the day <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 isn ' t the office as important as the site ? <eos>
 of course it is <eos>
 right ? <eos>
 i can ' t find a line to respond to siteoriented work <eos>
 why would this big building be necessary ? <eos>
 site work is completed in the office <eos>
 i agree <eos>
 there ' s no clear line between site and office for us <eos>
 that ' s how it ' s like for trade you need both <eos>
 you run around like crazy at the site <eos>
 then you work like mad in the office <eos>
 what ? <eos>

 i won ' t be qualified <eos>
 i ' m in an awkward position <eos>
 i don ' t know whether to wish you ' d pass or fail <eos>

 on the international stage <eos>
 so we applied for one international and ? <eos>
 ? we ' re jang gi suk ? <eos>

 well life isn ' t easy <eos>
 we were team 1 <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 where ' d you get the logo ? <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 ? it was captured <eos>
 it was the only one available so gi suk did it <eos>
 but hyun wu ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry about that <eos>
 next <eos>
 but he ? <eos>
 next <eos>
 myanmar is in a location connecting china and india <eos>
 ever since 2011 they ' ve been developing gradually <eos>
 but crises can be categorized into risks ? <eos>
 do you even know you ' re mixing risk and crisis ? <eos>
 risk is the danger of loss <eos>
 crisis is ? <eos>
 team 3 ' s strategy is to secure the value chain through feed grains business for resources <eos>
 we participate productions and secure procurement channels <eos>
 our goal is to become a lead trader in food resources <eos>
 it ' s nice <eos>
 but you ' ll be more suited for an ad company ? <eos>
 yes i too think ? <eos>
 this center is expected to lead the steel industry <eos>
 and the center of ukraine ' s strategic business and eastern europe <eos>
 ok <eos>
 how did you end up applying for our company ? <eos>
 i was interested in trade <eos>
 you worked for a trading company before <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 ? i went to community college <eos>
 so i thought it wouldn ' t be competitive <eos>
 so you thought you could make it here with your background <eos>
 you went to community college but your gpa is good and you have talent <eos>
 how can you be so unconfident ? <eos>
 you want us to accept you or not ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 sorry about what ? <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 let me correct it <eos>
 i never disregarded this company <eos>
 that doesn ' t work <eos>
 thinking that being honest will show the sincerity <eos>
 people can become honest to give some excuses <eos>
 regardless of the truth <eos>
 next <eos>
 regarding the development of solar energy <eos>
 the costs haven ' t decreased <eos>
 according to simulation results when we build 50k watt <eos>
 are you sick ? <eos>
 don ' t talk to me <eos>
 what ' s wrong ? will you be able to speak ? <eos>
 then we need to ? <eos>
 i didn ' t say i couldn ' t <eos>
 next ahn young yi and lee sang hyun <eos>
 come on out <eos>
 hello <eos>
 i ' ll be giving a presentation on india ' s solar energy ipp business plan <eos>
 i think we should expand value chains through networks and investments <eos>
 and present plans to develop independent power producers <eos>
 so i ' d like to present ways to enhance and specialize ipp <eos>
 there are 3 ways to enhance ipp <eos>
 if we acquire solar energy providing networks <eos>
 it will naturally bring higher value <eos>
 it will lead to better trading values <eos>
 we can reinforce the epc and smart <eos>
 manufacturing development and create synergy <eos>
 you must be wondering why solar energy <eos>
 this graph will explain that <eos>
 she ' s really good <eos>
 the solar energy ? <eos>
 how can you secure materials in india ? <eos>
 through materials such as ingot and wafer <eos>
 a value chain will be secured <eos>
 what about developing countries ? <eos>
 polysilicone manufacturers ? <eos>
 everything is going smooth for her <eos>
 she ' s so solid about her opinion <eos>
 she has guts <eos>
 seok ho was good too <eos>
 what about module manufacturers ' m&a ? <eos>
 she ' s shady <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 she ' s very shady <eos>
 so module manufacturers ' m&a ? <eos>
 ? through previous referrals ? <eos>
 ? references to ? <eos>
 ? developed countries ? <eos>
 what are previous references ? <eos>
 belgium or japan ? <eos>
 yes i ' ll tell you <eos>
 so module manufacturers ' m&a ? <eos>
 and previous references to work with developed countries <eos>
 i ' ll explain briefly <eos>
 he ' s making her look good now <eos>
 solar energy attracts many attentions in the country <eos>
 and the company infinity also has hundreds of plants in the philippines <eos>
 he looks comfortable since he gave up <eos>
 we analyzed the ranking index based on one international ' s values <eos>
 and we found out we need to ? <eos>
 ? develop businesses and <eos>
 ? be flexible to changes and be creative <eos>
 so we need to look at ibm ' s flexible new business strategy <eos>
 they have a radical system crossnext for direct management and affiliates <eos>
 this innovative idea ' s focus is on the process not the actual profits <eos>
 he shows presentations textbook <eos>
 his words are so clear <eos>
 very logical <eos>
 he ' s good <eos>
 but he ' s only moving his brains <eos>
 he needs to move people ' s hearts to sell <eos>
 that ' s my presentation regarding <eos>
 one international ' s future <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 i wonder how the test is going <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 he won ' t be shaking <eos>
 he ' s used to it <eos>
 it ' s nothing for him <eos>
 next jang geu rae and han suk yool <eos>
 jang geu rae ' s in your team ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 don ? t touch me <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 our presentation will be about <eos>
 " trade trapped in culture " <eos>
 it ' s about profitgenerating strategies through countermining that <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 what ' s with him ? <eos>
 he must be very nervous <eos>
 so our start is ? <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 suk yool ? <eos>
 he ' s not here now <eos>
 he ' s taking his intern test <eos>
 he ' s not here now <eos>
 why ' s everyone looking for him ? <eos>
 did you take your medication ? <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 breathe <eos>
 you look sick <eos>
 look up <eos>
 don ' t sound like you ' re reading it <eos>
 that ' s how we decided on our topic <eos>
 hey <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 breathe <eos>
 where ' s the fire ? <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i need more time <eos>
 i ' ll go take my medication to calm myself <eos>
 please <eos>
 go take it <eos>
 but i can ' t give you more time <eos>
 the others won ' t want that <eos>
 you have 7 more minutes left <eos>
 i ' ll just ? <eos>
 i ' ll do it <eos>
 i ' ll do it <eos>
 why that ? <eos>
 explain it <eos>
 why did you put that there ? <eos>
 just because ? <eos>
 there ' s no such thing as " just because " <eos>
 you need a plan for every move <eos>
 that ' s called an intention <eos>
 your topright is blocked <eos>
 what will you do about the crisis ? <eos>
 get rid of unnecessary ones <eos>
 get rid of what ? <eos>
 eloquence <eos>
 i ' ll get rid of the reason why i chose suk yool <eos>
 being trapped in culture ? <eos>
 ? means you ' re trapped on ? <eos>
 ? in the customs locations <eos>
 that ' s the limitation <eos>
 why ' s he stammering ? <eos>
 limitations of environment ? <eos>
 come on <eos>
 he won ' t make it <eos>
 limitational ? <eos>
 ? limitations ? <eos>
 this isn ' t working <eos>
 i need more than ambition <eos>
 geez <eos>
 dad ! <eos>
 suk yool ! <eos>
 are you going to the factory ? <eos>
 yeah i ' m starting the night shift <eos>
 your hands are black <eos>
 it ' s heavy grease <eos>
 why ? are you embarrassed ? <eos>
 no i ' m not embarrassed of you <eos>
 my boy ! <eos>
 bye <eos>
 you didn ' t hear the condition ? <eos>
 the whole labor union will be laid off <eos>
 suk yool ! <eos>
 my dad went to his office <eos>
 your dad is home huh ? <eos>
 you must be embarrassed <eos>
 no i ' m not embarrassed <eos>
 you must be embarrassed <eos>
 geez <eos>
 not making them want it is ? <eos>
 ? but making need it is our goal <eos>
 so that is limitation so environment limits <eos>
 he ' s probably taking his intern test <eos>
 he won ' t pick up <eos>
 yeah he ' s taking his intern test <eos>
 i called too <eos>
 he won ' t pick up <eos>
 when does his test end ? <eos>
 he ' ll get an office job finally <eos>
 he ' ll do good <eos>
 we should help him leave the site <eos>
 he has stage fright <eos>
 he took his medication ? <eos>
 there are no ? <eos>
 ? not many people ? <eos>
 ? in that region ? <eos>
 ? so containers aren ' t filled ? <eos>
  ? full ? <eos>
 wait <eos>
 it ' s all good but hard to listen to <eos>
 you need to use more formal terms <eos>
 not personal ones <eos>
 don ' t you think it ' s no good ? <eos>
 yeah ? i ' m sorry <eos>
 have you been to the site ? <eos>
 you need some creative input about the products <eos>
 you haven ' t gone to the site did you ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 interns these days know nothing <eos>
 you won ' t ask for a tour <eos>
 you won ' t go if your boss doesn ' t <eos>
 indeed ? <eos>
 ? the site is important <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 sorry for the trouble <eos>
 i ' ll continue <eos>
 dad i ' m not ashamed of you ? <eos>
 ? or the site <eos>
 you need to check cases where fcl doesn ' t work <eos>
 fulfilling conditions with forwarding agents are key <eos>
 lcl or air transport is possible <eos>
 you can send a small quantity to the consumer directly that way <eos>
 when people die in northern russian <eos>
 it was suk yool ' s time <eos>
 his presentation was smooth and flawless with terms used on sites <eos>
 the executives from the site looked impressed <eos>
 will ancients be able to come ? <eos>
 he was making up for the time he lost with his eloquence <eos>
 he took control <eos>
 he knew what he was doing <eos>
 he took full control that ' s it <eos>
 let me conclude <eos>
 now he had become a male young yi <eos>
 he changed into a pro from a conman in 3 minutes <eos>
 good job <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 it was so tough <eos>
 the executive director was so intimidating <eos>
 wasn ' t young yi amazing ? <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 young yi ! <eos>
 don ' t you want coffee ? young yi ! <eos>
 he needs to sell <eos>
 baek ki was great <eos>
 i think young yi was best after seok ho <eos>
 wasn ' t young yi amazing ? <eos>
 don ' t let them hear you <eos>
 anyway she ' s a girl <eos>
 suk yool was good <eos>
 young yi was like a pro <eos>
 i liked geu rae ' s paper and presentation <eos>
 too bad <eos>
 it was a good chance <eos>
 that ' s his limit <eos>
 it ' s a miracle he came here <eos>
 i liked how he didn ' t go on <eos>
 you ' re saying that on purpose <eos>
 don ' t do that <eos>
 ultimately ? <eos>
 ? it ' ll harm you <eos>
 what are you saying ? <eos>
 we think our past is holding onto us <eos>
 but it ' s the other way around <eos>
 that ' s how you look now <eos>
 why you ? <eos>
 why should a married woman look at a married man ? <eos>
 don ' t look down on me just because you got promoted earlier <eos>
 you still think you ' re a hottie <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 how was geu rae ? <eos>
 no way <eos>
 he was a moron <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 i knew young yi was a pro <eos>
 mr oh come on <eos>
 i ' ll go to ijin chemicals <eos>
 ok ! <eos>
 trip him if you can ' t make it <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 you ' ll at least get the pleasure of seeing him trip <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 the second presentation interview will start <eos>
 as we ' ve told you <eos>
 you ' ll have to sell to your partner and why ? <eos>
 that will be fun won ' t it ? <eos>
 if you reject without a good reason your score will be deducted <eos>
 i bought this for $600 in hong kong <eos>
 i ' ll sell it to you for $350 <eos>
 i won ' t buy it <eos>
 that ' s no good reason <eos>
 this belt is korean but a great imitation ? <eos>
 you love name brands <eos>
 you need a wallet ? <eos>
 i think korean product quality is better <eos>
 you like foreign name brands <eos>
 you bragged about buying nice used items <eos>
 what ' s with him ? <eos>
 used items is discovering resources too <eos>
 you ' re talented jong min <eos>
 you ' re also diligent <eos>
 but you lack confidence <eos>
 that ' s because you don ' t have anything original <eos>
 you ' re the brand jong min <eos>
 don ' t imitate others <eos>
 buy this mirror to build ? <eos>
 ? you own originality <eos>
 i don ' t imitate others <eos>
 what ' s that ? <eos>
 the item i ' ll try to sell you is invaluable <eos>
 you can give me however much you want <eos>
 i ' ll sell an exclusive <eos>
 memory for young yi <eos>
 this is a day in one international <eos>
 intern ahn young yi ' s life <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 jang geu rae and han suk yool please prepare <eos>
 go ahead <eos>
 han suk yool will start <eos>
 this is what i ' ll sell to jang geu rae <eos>
 here <eos>
 these are the fabrics we ' re making in ulsan <eos>
 these are various synthetic fibers in <eos>
 including nylon and polypropylene <eos>
 they are creating high value <eos>
 in the 21st century <eos>
 one more thing <eos>
 this is a book of work environments ? <eos>
 losses due to mistakes in orders ? <eos>
 ? and analysis of miscommunication <eos>
 i ' ll sell this site info to you <eos>
 make up your mind geu rae <eos>
 i hope there are no issues <eos>
 of course not <eos>
 then ? <eos>
 ? i will just buy the book <eos>
 the fabric ? <eos>
 ? i won ' t take <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 the book has your analysis <eos>
 so it will save my time <eos>
 the fabric can be acquired anytime <eos>
 i don ' t need to buy yours <eos>
 he ' s good <eos>
 you don ' t know what you ' re talking about <eos>
 all of this fabric was made <eos>
 through my sweat and tears <eos>
 they ' re made through a pro ' s expertise <eos>
 i had to put up with being called a " dog " and " pervert " <eos>
 dog ? <eos>
 he knew that ? <eos>
 oh my ! <eos>
 still it ' s a crime to touch a woman ' s butt without permission <eos>
 i didn ' t touch her butt <eos>
 i was touching the fabric <eos>
 i ? <eos>
 you might ' ve been touching the fabric <eos>
 at the same time you ' re admitting you did touch her <eos>
 he ' s funny <eos>
 the fabric i wanted to touch ? <eos>
 ? happened to be on her butt <eos>
 you saw it <eos>
 i did <eos>
 you touched her butt <eos>
 ok <eos>
 calm down <eos>
 what will you do geu rae ? <eos>
 will you buy it or not ? <eos>
 if i had to study <eos>
 and build expertise like him to sell fabric ? <eos>
 ? then ? <eos>
 ? i ' d sell it with him <eos>
 if we both make it and come here <eos>
 will you sell it with me ? <eos>
 what will you do suk yool ? <eos>
 will you sell it with him ? <eos>
 that ? <eos>
 ? depends on his item <eos>
 cunning fellow <eos>
 interesting <eos>
 go ahead <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 yeah show it to me <eos>
 whatever you sell <eos>
 what is he holding ? <eos>
 i ' ll sell this work slipper to him <eos>
 where is my slipper ? <eos>
 where is my slipper ? <eos>
 you don ' t have one either ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 what ' s that ? <eos>
 this is mr oh ' s slipper <eos>
 that ' s mine <eos>
 maybe not <eos>
 look at his shoes <eos>
 that crazy ? <eos>
 they ' re clean <eos>
 office workers need to be <eos>
 neat since we meet clients <eos>
 most of the work is done in the office <eos>
 look at his slipper again <eos>
 what ' s he doing ? <eos>
 it ' s worn out <eos>
 you can see for yourself <eos>
 that dirty ? <eos>
 you can smell the sweat too <eos>
 the smell of sweat <eos>
 it means the office is part of the site <eos>
 i ' ll sell the <eos>
 combat boot of the office <eos>
 again wow <eos>
 awesome <eos>
 i won ' t buy it <eos>
 the office is not part of the site <eos>
 do you even know what the site is ? <eos>
 the site employees get laid off so easily ? <eos>
 by office workers who just sign a document ! <eos>
 you want to see their combat boot ? <eos>
 they wear construction boots <eos>
 to protect their feet in case heavy tools fall <eos>
 that ' s what you call combat boots <eos>
 i won ' t buy yours <eos>
 you ' ve always emphasized the site <eos>
 you ' ve only emphasized the site <eos>
 you must be all about how the <eos>
 machines work to make products <eos>
 you must be thinking about your <eos>
 expertise and experience in contests in the field <eos>
 what contest ? <eos>
 you won a contest ? <eos>
 i won contests ? <eos>
 but ? <eos>
 ? we take the crowded subway every day for work <eos>
 we check the foreign currency rate every day <eos>
 we try to prevent mistakes made by a single digit <eos>
 we check legal documents for a single sentence <eos>
 will you take responsibility ? <eos>
 we don ' t just sign a document <eos>
 you can ' t do this now <eos>
 there are tons of dialogue <eos>
 you also feel small in the process <eos>
 sometimes we stay up all night for foreign countries to get a single okay <eos>
 the items made at the site start to exist ? <eos>
 ? after the process of validating why they should be made <eos>
 they can ' t exist without going through the office <eos>
 there ' s no meaningless move <eos>
 there ' s no meaningless product made by the company <eos>
 the reason a stone gets in trouble is <eos>
 because you ' ve failed to see intentions <eos>
 the reason a product fails is because <eos>
 you ' ve failed to see ahead and plan <eos>
 when it ' s in trouble just let it die <eos>
 but you should use them to your benefit <eos>
 when a product is a failure just let it fail <eos>
 but you should use it to make a better product <eos>
 the office and site are mutually connected <eos>
 there may be mistakes between them <eos>
 but if you look at the big picture ? <eos>
 ? we ' re all aiming for the same goal of benefits <eos>
 the site in my mind is not <eos>
 different from the one you do <eos>
 applause <eos>

 she ' s the toughest working <eos>
 woman here and she ' s respected <eos>
 teach them a good lesson <eos>
 when ' s loading ? <eos>

 taking memos is good <eos>
 but you should thoroughly understand current contracts <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>

 myanmar case ? <eos>
 ok <eos>
 the last one is turkmenistan ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 let ' s see <eos>
 how come there ' s only a b/l draft ? <eos>
 the bill is issued to the shipper … <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 you didn ' t get the official b/l from sales team 3 ? <eos>
 well <eos>
 i knew it <eos>
 oh sang sik <eos>
 you ' re in trouble <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 where ' s the original b/l ? <eos>
 well … <eos>
 he didn ' t write the company name seller and buyer info … <eos>
 and got profits in his pocket without the original <eos>
 call him now <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 now ! <eos>
 yes <eos>
 uh mr oh <eos>
 about the one on turkmenistan <eos>
 how come there ' s only a b/l draft ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 where ' s the original b/l ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 sorry won ' t cut it <eos>
 mr jung <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 a newbie did it ? <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 train them well <eos>
 don’t let it happen again <eos>
 what did he say ? <eos>
 he said he ' s sorry <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 shall i go there or you want to come here ? <eos>
 shall i go ? <eos>
 you ' re with mr ma aren ' t you ? <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi <eos>
 hey <eos>
 what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 why ' d you put in the b/l draft ? <eos>
 i gave you the b/l two months ago ! <eos>
 no you didn ' t <eos>
 we never got it <eos>
 i know you and mr ma <eos>
 aren ' t you even embarrassed ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 even if you ' re scared of mr ma you should take responsibility ! <eos>
 how ' d you get to that position ? <eos>
 what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 you ' re the one who didn ' t take responsibility ! <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 it just ends with my being embarrassed <eos>
 there was no death like someone <eos>
 mr jung <eos>
 oh … <eos>
 what did you just say ? <eos>
 let him go <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 let go <eos>
 let him go <eos>
 what you want to hit me ? <eos>
 go ahead <eos>
 come on <eos>
 here <eos>
 oh gosh <eos>
 come on let ' s have another funeral <eos>
 mr jung ! <eos>
 mr oh ! <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 why ' d you hit him ? <eos>
 if they said the b/l is missing you should check and solve the issue ! <eos>
 are you a kid ? <eos>
 how can you hit him first <eos>
 sang sik <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 nothing for you to apologize about <eos>
 the turkmenistan one is from two months ago <eos>
 i ' m sure i gave mr oh the bill before i went on my business trip <eos>
 the meticulous man couldn ' t have forgotten to give it over <eos>
 why did mr jung have to bring up the past ? <eos>
 who died ? <eos>
 yun jae he died <eos>
 what happened ? <eos>
 was it a suicide ? <eos>
 any will ? <eos>
 were there any rumors that could give us trouble ? <eos>
 was there anything about me ? <eos>
 that jerk <eos>
 he acts all noble and hides when he ' s cornered ? <eos>
 he ' s not in the place to hit people <eos>
 he only put in the b/l draft <eos>
 where ' s the original b/l ? <eos>
 he said he gave it to us <eos>
 that jerk needs to be embarrassed to wake up <eos>
 what ' s going on with the b/l ? <eos>
 i don ' t know <eos>
 i don ' t care anymore now <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 so mr oh really could ' ve given it over <eos>
 why ' d you have to bring all this chaos when you ' re not sure ? <eos>
 that ' s not the issue here <eos>
 we weren ' t going to make the b/l a big issue <eos>
 he just went to ask and he hit him <eos>
 he threw him in front of everyone <eos>
 that shows how mr oh disregards our team <eos>
 that ' s why i ' m saying sorry <eos>
 why should you be sorry ? <eos>
 the guy who hit him should be <eos>
 he should give an official apology to the one he hit <eos>
 ok <eos>
 alright <eos>
 and … <eos>
 … tell him to upload an apology on the company intranet <eos>
 no way mr ma ! <eos>
 are you trying to embarrass mr oh ? <eos>
 he needs to be embarrassed <eos>
 last year because of him i … <eos>
 anyway if he doesn ' t do it i ' ll make this a bigger issue <eos>
 what will you do ? <eos>
 what will you do ? <eos>
 tell them it ' s bullshit <eos>
 mr oh ! <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 is mr jung ok ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 he ' s not hurt <eos>
 mr oh said he ' s sure he sent it <eos>
 i can ' t look for it <eos>
 i know <eos>
 what are you two so serious about ? <eos>
 you don’t want the training ? <eos>
 geu rae i heard there was some fun on your floor <eos>
 oh i heard news about mr oh just the other day <eos>
 i ' m sorry about what i said about him on the rooftop <eos>
 by the way my friend <eos>
 i could see why he got upset <eos>
 he has a story <eos>
 i was told that in the past mr oh … <eos>
 nice to meet you <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 i ' m sun ji young from sales team 1 <eos>
 and i ' ll be in charge of training <eos>
 nice to meet you <eos>
 i ' m sure you ' ve seen the emails i sent out <eos>
 what i sent … <eos>
 what i sent is feedback <eos>
 from our business partners … <eos>
 i have a funeral to attend <eos>
 pick up so mi from the daycare honey <eos>
 it shows how sales team 1 and one international work hard … <eos>
 … on client care and contract management <eos>
 let ' s see how important document <eos>
 communication is through your emails <eos>
 it ' s all a strategy you know <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 they don’t give you work right ? <eos>
 they want to show who ' s boss in the beginning <eos>
 that ' s what mr song said <eos>
 it ' s all because you ' re talented <eos>
 so keep your chin up <eos>
 young yi ' s luckier since you have work at least <eos>
 it ' s tough to get adjusted to resources <eos>
 they don ' t know how to become friends with women <eos>
 but i ' m loved by bosses <eos>
 hello sir <eos>
 is training over young yi ? run here now <eos>
 i ' ll be right over <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 my boss always needs me <eos>
 oh dear <eos>
 hello sir <eos>
 sir <eos>
 you think you ' re above meetings ? <eos>
 gosh the meeting with me was nothing to you ? <eos>
 you didn ' t say it was urgent <eos>
 so i was going to go after finishing the proposal <eos>
 accounting said they need it by today for setting budgets <eos>
 then you should ' ve pulled an allnighter <eos>
 what will you do about the meeting on company selection ? <eos>
 this is why i can ' t work with women <eos>
 no sense of sacrifice <eos>
 what can i expect ? <eos>
 why are you so stiff ? <eos>
 aren ' t you going to say you ' re sorry ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 go get out of my face <eos>
 you can take her there before you leave <eos>
 leave it to your mother or whatever <eos>
 it ' s what we promised <eos>
 are you the only one who works ? <eos>
 it ' s the meeting i postponed a week because of you <eos>
 i can ' t postpone it again <eos>
 never mind i have to go out for work now <eos>
 i ' m sorry about that <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 is something wrong ? <eos>
 your eyes are red <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 oh my <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 so mi ' s mother <eos>
 so mi forgot to take this yesterday <eos>
 yes thanks <eos>
 see you … <eos>
 your child must have drawn it <eos>
 but there ' s no face <eos>
 she didn ' t finish it i guess <eos>
 why do you keep looking at me ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 i asked why do you keep looking at me ? <eos>
 sorry <eos>
 are you at your seat ? <eos>
 can i go see you now ? <eos>
 you know … <eos>
 … i didn ' t finish what i was saying <eos>
 actually you won ' t feel good about this <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 someone died because of mr oh <eos>
 stop looking over <eos>
 take care of this <eos>
 sure <eos>
 that ' s nonsense ! <eos>
 sit sit <eos>
 it was when he was an assistant manager <eos>
 something his subordinate did went wrong <eos>
 mr oh must ' ve been at fault too <eos>
 mr oh ignored him <eos>
 when he resigned <eos>
 the subordinate opened a small shop with his mother <eos>
 but … <eos>
 … he died in an accident making a delivery <eos>
 so they ' re saying it wouldn ' t have happened <eos>
 if mr oh had taken responsibility <eos>
 go <eos>
 i ' m going <eos>
 ok <eos>
 go <eos>
 mr oh is something else <eos>
 this is so wrong of him <eos>
 mr oh wouldn ' t avoid responsibility <eos>
 you never know about people <eos>
 who wants to get fired ? <eos>
 sir <eos>
 chemicals is really being stubborn <eos>
 you asked for mr oh ' s help before <eos>
 now you want us out ? <eos>
 so don ' t you know what we went through <eos>
 for the japan and china cases and meet with them ? <eos>
 hey ! give it ! <eos>
 give it over ! <eos>
 no that won ' t solve it <eos>
 this is too much … <eos>
 hey take it ! <eos>
 how can you just give it over ? <eos>
 this has to do with our performance <eos>
 we did all the work and you want to give them the benefits ? <eos>
 how could you let that happen ? <eos>
 mr oh ! please ! <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 they ' re thinking whatever they want <eos>
 why won ' t you say something ? <eos>
 what are they thinking wrong ? <eos>
 the executive director signed a contract with a bad company <eos>
 you know it was an absurd contract <eos>
 you know everyone knew it was a bad company <eos>
 i heard he even got a commission <eos>
 while eun jae took all the blame ! <eos>
 his death has nothing to do with you so just tell them the truth ! <eos>
 nothing will change whether it was my fault or his <eos>
 that time … <eos>
 … i didn ' t take the responsibility <eos>
 how i didn ' t say i would take responsibility … <eos>
 … won ' t change <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 how many people could take responsibility in that situation ? <eos>
 everyone would ' ve done the same <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 we need to prepare for the training meeting <eos>
 why eun jae ? <eos>
 if not him will you take responsibility ? <eos>
 will you do that ? <eos>
 daycare centers only open until 6 pm <eos>
 we can ' t ask them to understand again <eos>
 soo jin <eos>
 oh my ! <eos>
 are you ok ? <eos>
 soo jin <eos>
 get up soo jin <eos>
 come on let ' s move her to the nursing room <eos>
 hey help her <eos>
 are you ok ? <eos>
 soo jin <eos>
 she ' s pregnant and she must have overworked herself <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 pregnant ? <eos>
 yes she needs rest <eos>
 hey did you know that ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 geez how many kids is she having ? <eos>
 didn ' t you say she has two kids ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why ' d she get pregnant again ? <eos>
 she ' s so selfish <eos>
 move ! <eos>
 she got pregnant again ? <eos>
 another leave ? <eos>
 we covered so much for her after the first and second kids <eos>
 when will we train the employees and all ? <eos>
 i busted my behind after she had her second kid <eos>
 gosh we ' ll have to borrow other team members <eos>
 geez <eos>
 women are always the problem <eos>
 after all that studying they get married have pregnant a husband … <eos>
 they have so many excuses <eos>
 or they try to get a quick fix by crying <eos>
 that ' s because they ' re unloyal <eos>
 do your work <eos>
 ms sun <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 soo jin ' s been working overtime for the whole week <eos>
 i wonder why she didn’t tell us <eos>
 she couldn ' t have <eos>
 third kid is tough <eos>
 times have changed but working <eos>
 and taking care of kids is hard <eos>
 working moms are always at fault <eos>
 to the company to inlaws … <eos>
 … and of course the kid <eos>
 it ' s impossible without the husband ' s help <eos>
 if you want to continue working don’t get married <eos>
 it will save you trouble <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 time for the meeting <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i wish he wouldn ' t come <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 oh nothing <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 regarding the resources takeover case … <eos>

 i ' m aware of everything so i won ' t make any mistakes <eos>
 each team will hand in the reports <eos>
 our team will give you a report <eos>
 regarding the indonesia case when we ' re ready <eos>
 you ' re aware it will take 23 days to receive a reply right ? <eos>
 i hope resources can give us some more time <eos>
 we ' ll take it you ' ll give us 23 days and wrap it up <eos>
 fine <eos>
 the other teams can just do your data organization <eos>
 sometimes they keep calling us <eos>
 take care of that mr ha <eos>

 how can we wrap it up ? <eos>
 there ' s no b/l <eos>

 you really won ' t give it over ? <eos>
 i told you it ' s been given over <eos>
 what company is in on this too ? <eos>
 how much did you pocket ? <eos>
 sir <eos>
 you know mr oh wouldn ' t do that <eos>
 you be quiet <eos>
 women should know their place <eos>
 sir <eos>
 then you should ' ve talked to me in private <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 why aren ' t you apologizing ? <eos>
 why won ' t you upload it ? <eos>
 since there ' s nothing to apologize about <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 after hitting a man ? <eos>

 the complaint regarding your sexual harassment issue <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 when i stood witness <eos>
 hey oh sang sik ! <eos>
 why bring that up here ? <eos>
 and sexual harassment ? <eos>
 why ' s that sexual harassment ? <eos>
 she shouldn ' t have worn that lowcut shirt <eos>
 did i touch or look inside ? <eos>
 " if you ' re going to hide yourself each time you bend over why ' d you wear that ? <eos>
 just let it all hang out " <eos>
 is that sexual harassment ? that ' s sexual harassment ? <eos>
 that was sarcasm <eos>
 i meant don ' t wear such stuff <eos>
 " there ' s nothing worth seeing " <eos>
 you added that <eos>
 so … <eos>
 … is that sexual harassment ? <eos>
 asking them for a cup of coffee is too <eos>
 worrying they can ' t get married is too <eos>
 i hate all these tough women ! <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 you tell me <eos>
 is that sexual harassment ? <eos>
 is it ? <eos>
 why can ' t you answer me ? <eos>
 i think it is … <eos>
 … if the person who heard it … <eos>
 … was sexually offended <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 what did you just say ? <eos>
 where are you going ? <eos>
 you told me to write an apology ! <eos>
 i ' m going to do that ! <eos>
 you should wrap things up in there <eos>
 yes <eos>

 let ' s go there ' s a meeting with a client <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 that jerk <eos>
 geez <eos>
 mr ma got in trouble for sexual harassment ? <eos>
 he got a pay cut for 3 months for it <eos>
 mr oh stood witness for it ? <eos>
 mr oh is hard to understand too <eos>
 he stands for justice in times like that <eos>
 he ' s so different in his situations it ' s hard to understand <eos>
 geez <eos>
 he ' s good at work though <eos>
 wrap it up <eos>
 mr kang <eos>
 wait up <eos>
 i wonder where the b/l went <eos>
 mr oh is amazing <eos>
 he ' s just insisting he gave it when they say they didn’t receive it <eos>
 he ' s saying he gave it since he did <eos>
 so where is it ? <eos>
 you mean resources is lying ? <eos>
 we were interns two months ago <eos>

 no need to drag me into this <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 there ' s a b/l from the sales team 3 on the desk <eos>
 bring that over <eos>
 you really never saw it ? <eos>
 why do you keep asking ? <eos>
 you never saw it ? <eos>
 it ' ll be better if you didn ' t know if i did or not <eos>
 what are you saying ? <eos>
 if i say i did will you tell sales team 3 ? <eos>
 think about your position <eos>
 if that ' s revealed how do you think resources will treat you ? <eos>
 it ' s like pouring gas over fire <eos>
 why do that ? <eos>
 mr oh won ' t take your side just because you help sale team 3 <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 this isn ' t your business <eos>
 you ' re in resources <eos>
 that ' s reality <eos>
 mr oh is a true man <eos>

 sir let ' s wrap it up <eos>
 mr oh must ' ve learned his lesson <eos>
 give me my glasses <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 geez <eos>
 young yi bring me some coffee <eos>
 sure <eos>
 what will we do ? <eos>
 the issue is getting bigger <eos>
 why didn ' t you just say it when he signed it ? <eos>
 you should have honestly said it was left out <eos>
 hey our boss wasn ' t being told off for once and i couldn ' t say that <eos>
 also mr oh is all worked up <eos>
 i couldn ' t do that <eos>
 what will we do ? <eos>
 shall we shred it ? <eos>
 if dong sik asks for me tell him i went for a smoke <eos>
 sure <eos>
 mr oh wouldn ' t miss a b/l <eos>
 who cares if he ' s good ? <eos>
 you can ' t do anything about newbies <eos>
 you ' re right <eos>
 he won ' t know what b/ls and drafts are <eos>
 sales team 3 is in the mr choi ' s <eos>
 bad book and they ' re treated poorly <eos>
 they have the worst seats and few employees <eos>
 that ' s why they have such a newbie <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 why aren ' t you working ? <eos>
 i have a question <eos>
 you have a light ? <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 men should know how to smoke <eos>
 i used to smoke 3 packs a day when i was your age <eos>
 and you don ' t know the basic <eos>
 you should have a lighter to serve others <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 what ' s your question ? <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 the b/l <eos>
 is there any possibility you gave it and i missed it ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 so … <eos>
 … are you covering for me … <eos>
 no right <eos>
 go do your work ! <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 hi <eos>
 make two copies and file them <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 how long do you keep received b/ls ? <eos>
 why ? you want to look for it ? <eos>
 shall i ? <eos>
 no way <eos>
 you want to go search another team ' s stuff ? <eos>
 that ' s nonsense <eos>
 if it was possible i would ' ve done it already <eos>
 hurry up with that <eos>
 yes <eos>
 what was he talking about ? <eos>
 about b/l … <eos>
 i hope he doesn ' t search resources <eos>
 he can ' t be that stupid <eos>
 look <eos>
 yes <eos>
 bring this for the buyer meeting <eos>
 yes <eos>
 again ? <eos>
 we postponed it last week <eos>
 i know <eos>
 delay it for just 3 hours <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 ok <eos>
 sign this <eos>
 sure <eos>
 you ' re picking up your kid ? <eos>
 your parents can ' t ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 i have to leave her with my inlaws <eos>
 i ' m a guy too but guys think <eos>
 girls should give in all the time <eos>
 they don ' t know how hard girls <eos>
 have to work to climb up the ladder <eos>
 that too <eos>
 i know <eos>
 that ' s why my wife stopped working too <eos>
 you have three kids <eos>
 if not i would ' ve quit <eos>
 what ' s he doing ? <eos>
 good job <eos>
 about keeping silent <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 why are you lurking around resources ? <eos>
 were you looking for the b/l ? <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 then why ' d you go there ? <eos>
 did you go to see young yi ? <eos>
 come here <eos>
 did you ask young yi ? <eos>
 no i … <eos>
 why didn ' t you ask her ? <eos>
 should i ask her ? <eos>
 no way ! <eos>
 who told you to lurk around there ? <eos>
 don ' t you have work to do ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 not you <eos>
 go on a business trip if you ' re so idle <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 ms sun <eos>
 this isn ' t right <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 no <eos>
 it could become a problem if a subordinate gets involved in personal issues <eos>
 hold on <eos>
 mr oh geu rae … <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 i don ' t want him to cause accidents here <eos>
 i can ' t be any more embarrassed <eos>
 mr oh is really doing things his way today <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 no problem <eos>
 meeting a client ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' m going for ms sun ' s child <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 that ' s good <eos>
 i ' ll see you tomorrow <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 is mr oh ok ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 mr oh shouldn ' t have brought <eos>
 up what happened before <eos>
 he should respect people have <eos>
 things they don’t want brought up again <eos>
 i understand why mr oh got that mad <eos>
 he ' s not mad now <eos>
 he ' s blaming himself <eos>
 most bad choices become regrets and get forgotten <eos>
 but not always <eos>
 some things haunt you forever <eos>
 they don’t get forgotten <eos>
 and you can ' t take them back <eos>
 he ' s blaming himself <eos>
 he looks lonely to me <eos>
 i came to get so mi <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i got a call from so mi ' s mother <eos>
 let ' s go home so mi <eos>
 ok <eos>
 alright <eos>
 they ' re in the allday class <eos>
 their mothers will come soon <eos>
 where ' s my mom ? <eos>
 she ' ll come soon <eos>
 let ' s go wait inside <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>

 we have to be with them as guardians <eos>
 the teacher will go home soon and i have to work <eos>

 i ' ll call you back <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 is everyone gone ? <eos>
 they went to the buyers ' meeting <eos>
 i ' ll carry some <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 resources is tough isn ' t it ? <eos>
 it ' s always been tough for women <eos>
 they always discriminate between the genders <eos>
 but only elites go there <eos>
 you ' re hanging in there very well <eos>
 it ' s not that easy <eos>
 right ? <eos>
 uh ms sun … <eos>
 i have a question <eos>
 sure <eos>
 there ' s something i should do and i know it ' s right <eos>
 i ' m hesitant about it though <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 it might complicate things <eos>
 does it have to do with resources ? <eos>
 does ignoring something that ' s right <eos>
 make things more simple ? <eos>
 at least you can avoid criticism <eos>
 it ' s because i ' m a girl … <eos>
 i don ' t know what it is <eos>
 what does gender have to do with what ' s right ? <eos>
 it has to do with … <eos>
 … your conscience <eos>
 regarding conscience … <eos>
 everyone knows <eos>
 there are people who don ' t do it when they know … <eos>
 … those who do because they know <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 sorry <eos>
 for telling you now <eos>
 it would ' ve been better if i ' d brought the b/l <eos>

 i ' ll be waiting … <eos>
 i was the first person to arrive at work <eos>

 a stationery shop owner from when i was a kid always … <eos>
 opened the place and cleaned the front <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi going to school ? i loved how the clean alley felt <eos>
 i started the day going past it <eos>
 it felt great opening the door and start the day like him <eos>
 i checked various notice boards <eos>
 i read news articles of various themes through the intranet <eos>
 there was an appropriate amount of tension and ease of mind <eos>
 it was just like a stylish drama scene <eos>

 the data isn ' t that hard to receive ! <eos>
 i think <eos>
 the cost is a bigger issue <eos>
 did you show them the appropriate price ? <eos>
 if you consider the production cost and general expenses that ' s reasonable ! <eos>
 yes but they think it ' s unreasonable <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 i told you to fix your attitude <eos>
 we can ' t sell anything like that <eos>
 what can we live on if we satisfy all their needs ? <eos>
 you have a problem <eos>
 will you be on our side ? <eos>

 why do we always have to suffer ? <eos>
 are you talking about the wilmart ramen case ? <eos>
 they said if sales team 3 solves that <eos>
 sales teams 1 2 ' s work will go smoothly <eos>
 that ramen case doesn ' t really help sales team 3 ' s performance <eos>
 sales team 3 suffers and sales teams 1 2 gets the credit <eos>
 yet you have to pull it off <eos>
 it ' s discouraging isn ' t it ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>

 the electric wheelchair one … <eos>

 i said i ' d review it if you could get accurate profits calculated <eos>

 it ' s a small company <eos>
 but r&d is under way so if you work … <eos>
 we can ' t connect clients not knowing <eos>
 the profittoinvestment ratio <eos>
 i told you many times <eos>
 still you know … <eos>
 i ' ll call the company again <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i ' ll return some books <eos>
 return mine too <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 yes how ' s that case going ? <eos>
 what did they say ? <eos>
 don ' t you know the buyer is bugging me ? <eos>
 yes i ' ll call them again <eos>
 you keep calling with no results ! <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>

 sun young coffee <eos>

 she was but she ' ll be ok <eos>
 anyway i ' ll do my best to resolve your issue <eos>
 sorry well <eos>
 i ' m sure the shipping issue will be resolved <eos>
 you didn ' t do it on purpose <eos>
 anyway i ' m worried about your daughter <eos>
 you must be concerned <eos>
 yeah … <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i just met with him <eos>
 he hadn ' t checked the items for guangzhou <eos>
 they ' re securing goods in stock <eos>
 so ? <eos>
 i asked them to hurry up with it and … <eos>
 what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 if you went all the way there you should have brought up freight compensation … <eos>
 so they can understand this issue <eos>
 don’t come back until you resolve it ! <eos>
 yes <eos>
 how did it go ? i heard it went smoothly <eos>
 then why is there no call ? <eos>
 don ' t worry he ' s his friend <eos>
 he said to trust him <eos>
 don ' t you think this is too much ? <eos>
 you made us become scapegoats <eos>
 stop bugging us <eos>
 one international jang geu rae speaking <eos>
 wilmart purchasing team ? <eos>
 hold on i ' ll put mr oh on <eos>
 oh sang sik speaking <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yes <eos>
 ok <eos>
 dude … <eos>
 friend ? <eos>
 i thought he was your friend ! <eos>
 you shouldn ' t have said it then <eos>
 we would ' ve made a different strategy if you hadn ' t <eos>
 you totally ruined it all ! <eos>
 what are you going to do now ? <eos>
 you said we can trust you ! <eos>
 what are you going to do now ? <eos>
 you said we could have trust <eos>
 you said he ' s your friend and we could have trust no ? <eos>
 what ' s this now ? <eos>
 mr oh say something <eos>
 what ' s the reason ? <eos>
 you don’t like the delivery conditions ? <eos>
 no those are great <eos>
 our company never had intentions to begin with <eos>
 we thought it lacked marketability <eos>
 then why ' d you waste time if that ' s the case ? <eos>
 you used to take my side dishes before <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i ' m just kidding <eos>
 you have something against me ? <eos>
 no we ' re not kids <eos>
 i used to a long ago <eos>
 so … <eos>
 … what about the past ? <eos>
 we ' re not kids <eos>
 i ' m not going into that <eos>
 i ' ll say it so you understand <eos>
 you might not know but i used to kiss up to you <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 so i just wanted you to kiss up for once <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 see you at the class reunion <eos>
 bye buddy ! <eos>
 dang ! <eos>
 he must be so disappointed <eos>
 you know when it ' s toughest when doing sales ? <eos>
 when ? <eos>
 having to entertain someone you know personally <eos>
 what ' s tougher is … <eos>
 … having to entertain a friend <eos>
 entertaining <eos>
 someone inevitably happens in a vertical dynamic <eos>
 it ' s more embarrassing since it ' s your friend <eos>
 then you wonder if it ' s all worth it <eos>
 honey <eos>
 you know right ? <eos>
 my college friend sung sik <eos>
 he quit <eos>
 went to graduate school and now works for a good company <eos>
 maybe i should … <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 you already registered ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 i wanted to talk with you about it first <eos>
 me ? <eos>
 oh … <eos>
 i ' ll have a shot with sung sik before i go <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 ok <eos>
 sung sik <eos>
 do you like working there ? <eos>
 but <eos>
 what did you do <eos>
 about your place when you were preparing for grad school ? <eos>
 living expenses must have been tough <eos>
 if you want to do something just think of yourself<u></u> <eos>
 there ' s no choice that will satisfy everyone <eos>
 take responsibility for your choice <eos>
 i ' m happy … <eos>
 i ' m happy but … <eos>
 i don ' t want to go home <eos>
 it ' s stressful … <eos>
 … at home <eos>
 ok <eos>
 call me when you resolve it <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 we ' re in charge of newbie training <eos>
 there ' s a subcontractor trip set up so you take charge <eos>
 huh me ? <eos>
 it ' s mr park now ? <eos>
 ok <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 we can ' t sell anything like that <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 go clear away the paper on the rooftop <eos>
 if you want to do something just think of yourself <eos>
 oh <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi <eos>
 you ' re mr park in it sales right ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' m newbie jang geu rae in sales team 3 <eos>
 i ' ll be going to the subcontractor trip with you <eos>
 i see <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 unlike other bosses <eos>
 i won ' t be of much help <eos>
 mr oh said i can learn a lot from you <eos>
 he said you set a great example with the clients <eos>
 me ? <eos>
 what else … <eos>
 … did he say ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 you ' re considerate of the interests among companies <eos>
 he said … <eos>
 an iron hand in a velvet glove <eos>
 that ' s essential for sales <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 then shall i tell you about sales on the way ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 there are many funny stories <eos>
 i said i ' d drive <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 it ' s best that i do it i know the way <eos>
 where was i ? <eos>
 sales are like a war <eos>
 you need guts <eos>
 you should think you ' d lose if you get behind <eos>
 there are tons of painful and <eos>
 victorious experiences <eos>
 once the client couldn ' t meet the delivery deadline <eos>
 all the upper management came and pleaded <eos>
 " if you overlook it it will be fine so please " <eos>
 and ? <eos>
 i said firmly <eos>
 " let ' s do it by the book " <eos>
 you ' re a true business man <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 maybe that was too big of a lie <eos>
 but i feel great <eos>
 it ' s our client and they ' re working with a chinese semiconductor firm <eos>
 but some problems have occurred recently <eos>
 what ' s that ? <eos>
 delivery keeps being delayed <eos>
 they said they don ' t have goods in stock <eos>
 maybe they have another client <eos>
 usually the existing client thinks they ' re safe <eos>
 no not this firm <eos>
 they ' ve built trust with me <eos>
 we need to visit once in a while <eos>
 for good tension <eos>
 we ' re busy now so leave one international for now <eos>
 they ' re new so manage them well <eos>
 try to hold out <eos>
 with one international on the phone as long as possible <eos>
 mr park ? <eos>
 he ' s soft so he ' s not much of a problem <eos>
 geez <eos>
 so i ' ll carry on with that <eos>
 it ' ll be awesome <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 so they think of us as a pushover <eos>
 mr park we ' ll go back to the office <eos>
 oh ok <eos>
 sorry <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 go back <eos>
 i ' ll stay a bit longer <eos>
 geu rae let ' s talk <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 geu rae i think we should go now <eos>
 mr park was so perplexed <eos>
 and the training isn ' t over <eos>
 there ' s nothing we can do for him here <eos>
 the site trip is meaningless too now <eos>
 do whatever you want i ' ll get going <eos>
 i ' ll get going mr park <eos>
 sure <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 they think of us as a pushover <eos>
 me and … <eos>
 … the company <eos>
 i wasn ' t cut out for this work to begin with <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 are you done talking ? <eos>
 i better resign <eos>
 why didn ' t you call me in advance ? <eos>
 where did the other man go ? he had to go back to the office <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 let ' s go in uh … <eos>
 when will you resolve our issue ? <eos>
 right away ! <eos>
 of course ! <eos>
 i talked with you on the phone ! <eos>
 i ' m a fool <eos>
 yes you ' re right we talked on the phone <eos>
 sorry <eos>
 i was going to resolve it first <eos>
 but choices increased because of new businesses <eos>
 let ' s leave <eos>
 you ' re considerate of the interests among companies <eos>
 i said firmly <eos>
 " let ' s do it by the book " <eos>
 show him what you got <eos>
 show him <eos>
 show him what you got <eos>
 it was all lie though <eos>
 there ' s no choice that will satisfy everyone <eos>
 take responsibility for your choice <eos>
 did i want to become a nice guy who never complains ? <eos>
 did i ever take responsibility at the workplace ? <eos>
 sir mr park <eos>
 we made a mistake <eos>
 we ' ll take care of it now <eos>
 ok ? will it be ok … <eos>
 … to do it by the book ? <eos>
 if i don ' t do it now … <eos>
 … it ' ll be the same wherever i go <eos>
 i have nothing to say mr park <eos>
 i ' m really sorry <eos>
 i ' ll fix it today … <eos>
 … and make sure it leaves incheon tomorrow <eos>
 i told you we ' ll do it by the book <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 it ' s my fault <eos>
 it ' s all my fault <eos>
 we ' ve worked with one international for years <eos>
 mr park we go way back with your boss <eos>
 we have a long history <eos>
 wouldn ' t it be a waste for that trust to be broken ? <eos>
 let ' s keep things positive <eos>
 let ' s make things smooth <eos>
 this is how they treat me <eos>
 i was such a pushover to them <eos>
 you ' ve already embarrassed me enough <eos>
 how low will you drag me ? <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 despite our long history we made a mistake <eos>
 you wanted to do it by the book <eos>
 what do you mean by that ? <eos>
 contract termination or compensation ? <eos>
 i ' ll … <eos>
 … discuss that with the headquarters and let you know <eos>
 why are you so foolish ? <eos>
 you wanted to make a few bucks <eos>
 so you become enemies with our old partner ? <eos>
 what will you do ? <eos>
 because of me … <eos>
 … a partner relationship of 10 years is going to break <eos>
 i should have just overlooked it <eos>
 we ' re about to lose a precious client because of you ! <eos>
 uh … <eos>
 today sir … <eos>
 i ' ve never been this embarrassed in my life ! <eos>
 a move you make when things don ' t look good <eos>
 are you crazy about money ? <eos>
 the move you make to turn the tables … <eos>
 you love money ? … is called a clever move … <eos>
 … in the game of go <eos>
 geez if the clever move was brilliant … <eos>
 i ' m sorry … it proves they had the upper hand <eos>
 calm down <eos>
 mr park didn ' t think it would come to this <eos>
 the reason they were shocked and continued to persuade him … <eos>
 … is because mr park wasn ' t like this before <eos>
 it ' s like they ' re looking one way or another <eos>
 he ' s looking at them but he ' s criticizing mr park <eos>
 i have no choice please sir <eos>
 i should go beg myself <eos>
 mr kim please call me <eos>
 please calm down let go ! <eos>
 we ' ll take care of it now <eos>
 let go ! <eos>
 sorry the company is calling me <eos>
 ok let go <eos>
 it ' s so late now <eos>
 oh dear <eos>
 what if you get in trouble ? <eos>
 no i came for work <eos>
 also i ' m with you <eos>
 yes mr kim we ' re here <eos>
 yes <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 you can ' t hear me ? <eos>
 when are we coming ? <eos>
 i think it ' ll take a while <eos>
 there ' s a problem here <eos>
 the president will visit us and explain himself <eos>
 clever moves are … <eos>
 he said so himself <eos>
 … dealt with by proper moves <eos>
 i ' ll report to you when we ' re done <eos>
 yes <eos>
 there ' s an issue with yeong seong ? yes <eos>
 i got a call from mr park <eos>
 and the president and employees are coming <eos>
 i checked and there were delivery problems <eos>
 what ' s this ? <eos>
 there are so many <eos>
 call the risk management inspection and business teams <eos>
 i ' ll report this to the executive director <eos>
 hey yes <eos>
 come over here <eos>
 organize these <eos>
 did you call the forwarding agency ? <eos>
 this is the it sales team <eos>
 our guangzhou case … <eos>
 please get the contract ready for us <eos>
 don ' t forget the data on shipment dates and schedule <eos>
 there was a problem with yeong seong <eos>
 check the accurate limits now <eos>
 isn ' t it a reliable company with a good history ? <eos>
 can you prepare a file on what happened ? <eos>
 oh my <eos>
 coming … <eos>
 hello geu rae <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 which floor ? <eos>
 hello sir <eos>
 oh mr kim <eos>
 i ' m so sorry <eos>
 please wait in the guest room <eos>
 take him there <eos>
 you go with me <eos>
 who are you ? <eos>
 jang geu rae in sales team 3 <eos>
 sir <eos>
 can he go with me ? <eos>
 how could i … <eos>
 it ' ll be a good learning experience <eos>
 and he played a big part at the site <eos>
 so i ' ll need him <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 yeong seong or whatever is here now <eos>
 our risk management and legal teams are all there <eos>
 i ' m surprised <eos>
 he didn ' t seem that brave <eos>
 it ' s a big issue <eos>
 geu rae went into that big meeting <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 there was a big issue today <eos>
 geu rae is going into one international ' s big meeting <eos>
 how could a newbie go in there ? <eos>
 he might get promoted before us all <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 ged legend <eos>
 i don’t know how he ' s going to be any help <eos>
 they must ' ve taken him in since he ' s some help <eos>
 baek ki is being patient too <eos>
 experiences of such meetings are very helpful for newbies like us <eos>
 baek ki … <eos>
 … why ' d you come back ? <eos>
 i didn ' t think i should be there <eos>
 honestly … <eos>
 … he ' s not like you right ? <eos>
 right you know … <eos>
 yeah he is indecisive <eos>
 he ' s not strongwilled <eos>
 clients don ' t prioritize him either <eos>
 geu rae stayed there until the end <eos>
 maybe it ' s being nosy <eos>
 anyway yeong seong is in big trouble <eos>
 it ' s over for them <eos>
 well … <eos>
 … it depends on mr park ' s testimony <eos>
 i think they ' ll probably just let it go <eos>
 people like him just avoid problems <eos>
 he doesn’t have <eos>
 what it takes to solve them <eos>
 were there similar cases ? <eos>
 yes there was <eos>
 they weren ' t situations to secure products from other locations <eos>
 there no were penalties so the loss wasn ' t huge <eos>
 the items didn ' t require prompt treatment so the risks weren ' t big either <eos>
 regardless of compensation contract review is inevitable <eos>
 it ' s been seven times <eos>
 it ' s not worth a case <eos>
 why did this happen ? <eos>
 mr park will explain since he ' s in charge <eos>
 i ' ll … <eos>
 … explain <eos>
 mr park was overwhelmed by the gravity of the case <eos>
 he ' s concerned about the other company ' s crisis <eos>
 that ' s foolish <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 for your reference <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 i ' ll tell you what hap … <eos>
 the secret is to … <eos>
 … scrap unnecessary things when in a crisis <eos>
 become irresponsible ! <eos>
 scrap it <eos>
 you can ' t take care of everyone <eos>
 you need to survive here <eos>
 i ' ll report … <eos>
 … what happened <eos>
 i ' m sorry sir <eos>
 we were wrong <eos>
 no it ' s my fault <eos>
 there were seven freight delays <eos>
 i found out the cause today <eos>
 yeong seong was focusing on other transactions <eos>
 while increasing clients <eos>
 our shipments were delayed in the process <eos>
 i found out about it today <eos>
 and asked about the responsibility <eos>
 you found out because you went to the site <eos>
 yes you should always check with them <eos>
 but … <eos>
 … there are some problems regarding this <eos>
 while those issues occurred <eos>
 i didn ' t do anything about it as the one in charge <eos>
 the fact is we didn ' t realize how serious this was in the beginning <eos>
 also i wasn ' t <eos>
 confident about my work <eos>
 i ' m the one to blame here <eos>
 i ' m the one <eos>
 that made them think it was ok <eos>
 i didn ' t take responsibility <eos>
 i ' m the one … <eos>
 … who ' s responsible <eos>
 when the industry increased shipment costs with oil cost increases … <eos>
 … our company decreased them <eos>
 i couldn ' t pursuade them as a company representative <eos>
 that ' s why they looked for other profits <eos>
 i just thought about leaving <eos>
 with frustration about work <eos>
 i think i ' m at fault for this <eos>
 i ' ll take responsibility <eos>
 save … <eos>
 … them <eos>
 keep the contract <eos>
 don ' t … <eos>
 … penalize them <eos>
 when did you start working here ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 he ' s been here for four years <eos>
 you ' re a romantic guy <eos>
 would we abandon a 10year partner because of this ? <eos>
 who are you ? <eos>
 why should you take responsibility ? <eos>
 how will you ? <eos>
 you should think about now though <eos>
 it ' ll be bad for you your family and the company later <eos>
 it ' s a good thing so keep thinking <eos>
 wrap it up well <eos>
 it was more miserable than any go game <eos>
 everyone has their own game <eos>
 how could i … <eos>
 … dare to … <eos>
 … teach him anything ? <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 yes <eos>
 it worked out <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 it sales mr park <eos>
 yeong seong was saved and he didn ' t get in trouble either <eos>
 the meeting went really smoothly <eos>
 i heard mr park was great <eos>
 oh … <eos>
 … why are you telling me ? <eos>
 you ' re curious no ? <eos>
 i thought you were super curious <eos>
 suk yool yes sir <eos>
 that ? <eos>
 i have to go <eos>
 suk … <eos>
 why are you so down when mr park ' s case went well ? <eos>
 i heard you went in too <eos>
 something wrong ? <eos>
 i couldn ' t be of any help <eos>
 what ' s with you ? <eos>
 now you realize that ? <eos>
 we can ' t do anything yet <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 thanks geu rae <eos>
 you helped remove my unnecessary traits <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 thank you yeong seong will <eos>
 sign a new contract that works to one international ' s benefit <eos>
 mr park will find the issue and <eos>
 write a report on how to prevent it <eos>
 i thought mr park would get in trouble <eos>
 that ' s how it ' s like here <eos>
 we can ' t help from having various risks <eos>
 no matter how you prepare accidents happen <eos>
 you can ' t ask employees to take responsibility each time <eos>
 so the company focuses on <eos>
 finding solutions for these issues <eos>
 when you were punished last time … <eos>
 that ' s why it ' s nonsense <eos>
 even if the firm protects you you suffer <eos>
 if you don ' t write a thorough report … <eos>
 … they could ask you to take responsibility if something similar happens <eos>
 mr oh shall i write the wilmart process report ? <eos>
 it ' s ok i ' ll do it <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i sent you an email so read it <eos>
 geez <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 next <eos>
 what ' s a tradingman ? <eos>
 tradingman is the ultrabest hero <eos>
 in the world <eos>
 he buys products for <eos>
 everyone on earth <eos>
 they make poor countries rich <eos>
 while supplying water to those without <eos>
 he beats <eos>
 spiderman batman and ironman <eos>
 don ' t lie ! <eos>
 i ' m not ! <eos>
 liar ! <eos>
 i ' ll tell my dad and scold you ! <eos>
 hey <eos>
 stop it ! <eos>
 he ' s a tough one <eos>
 have him work as one too yeah <eos>
 do it ! <eos>
 now ! you ! <eos>
 totally like you ! <eos>
 yeah this is why i work here <eos>
 totally like you ! right <eos>
 everyone has their own game of go <eos>
 hey are you crazy ? <eos>
 what ' s with you today ? <eos>
 i said let ' s revive a project which was on hold <eos>
 not evaluate my report <eos>
 that ' s not what happened i analyzed as you ? <eos>
 right you " analyzed " it found it didn ' t suit the market trends <eos>
 and the research is off ! <eos>
 that opinion just came out during the review <eos>
 revisions are necessary since the report was made long ago <eos>
 and more data is needed ? <eos>
 you ' re basically saying <eos>
 the report is good for nothing ! <eos>
 that ' s not what i ' m saying ? <eos>
 shut up ! <eos>
 mr kang <eos>
 mr jung is looking for you <eos>
 this is no dumpster <eos>
 one guy throws them away another picks them up <eos>
 i picked them up first <eos>
 they ' re mine <eos>
 a meeting to decide on sales team 3 ' s new business item <eos>
 the finance team is for china <eos>
 i can see that <eos>
 clearly <eos>
 the best plan a as well as <eos>
 plans b and c are reviewed <eos>
 i wonder if crude oil import won ' t work <eos>
 it keeps lingering in my head <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 i think you should go with something reliable this time <eos>
 it ' d be preferable if we went with plan a <eos>
 but it seemed mr oh preferred an item on plan b <eos>
 things aren ' t looking good in iran <eos>
 the us enforced an embargo on iran ' s crude oil <eos>
 and the reason isn ' t clear either <eos>
 nor do we know when the embargo will be lifted <eos>
 i know <eos>
 it ' s tough <eos>
 but i still want to go with it <eos>
 i have a good feeling about it <eos>
 go stones hidden in the palms on one ' s hand <eos>
 you get a feeling after a while <eos>
 just like hood winkers hide a single card in their hand <eos>
 some go players hide their opponent ' s stones in theirs <eos>
 then let ' s report it to the risk management team <eos>
 they can do the final check <eos>
 ok <eos>
 get the materials ready <eos>
 i ' ll pursuade the dept manager <eos>
 sure <eos>
 mr oh won ' t be trying to deceive the company <eos>
 but he ' s trying to be cunning with all number of cases <eos>
 under consideration <eos>
 the reason a newbie like myself can see that <eos>
 is because that prudent man wasn ' t able to read <eos>
 mr kim ' s unsatisfied face from ignoring the data <eos>
 isn ' t the china case safer ? <eos>
 yes but the iran case ' s profits are higher <eos>
 you know crude oil can help chemicals too <eos>
 can you get the approval of finances or risk management ? <eos>
 it ' s too risky in this day and age <eos>
 too risky <eos>
 i ' ll do whatever it takes to get approval <eos>
 mr oh shouldn ? t be doing that <eos>
 aside from iran ' s state of affairs <eos>
 the dept manager suggested the china rare earth resources proposal <eos>
 he goes against it <eos>
 is mr oh aware of that ? <eos>
 of course <eos>
 then why ? <eos>
 he thinks easy ones can be done by anyone else <eos>
 so he keeps obsessing over hard risky items <eos>
 it boils his blood i guess <eos>
 he ' s very competitive huh ? <eos>
 though he can relax a bit now <eos>
 honestly everyone ' s climbing up the social ladder <eos>
 he doesn ' t care about his performance ratings at all <eos>
 what we really need to see the results at this point <eos>
 i mean mr oh needs to be promoted <eos>
 what can we do ? <eos>
 let ' s do it well <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 he wants to do it what can we say ? <eos>
 if he can ' t he ' ll get drunk and wreak havoc with us <eos>
 it ' s on hold <eos>
 on hold ? <eos>
 our team passed it but finance rejected it <eos>
 rejected <eos>
 rejected <eos>
 also rejected <eos>
 go get their approval <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 who knows ? <eos>
 it could get into the next quarter ' s sales proposal <eos>
 she ' ll be wasting her time <eos>
 finance will never approve <eos>
 we kept submitting revised versions every quarter and nothing happened <eos>
 how can she pursuade them now ? <eos>
 if she pulls it off whose business will it be ? <eos>
 hey <eos>
 if that happens we have to go jump off a bridge <eos>
 why didn ' t you give her the opinion from finance ? <eos>
 come on she should find out for herself <eos>
 if she can ' t figure it out she ' ll run over to mr oh again <eos>
 you frozen or something ? <eos>
 mr oh ? <eos>
 don ' t think of reporting anything <eos>
 you need to be competent for that <eos>
 an incompetent guy trying to help is the worst <eos>
 submit the steel data soon <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 so business proposals can ' t go through unless finance approves ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 they ' re not easy to pass <eos>
 even if the other team members approve <eos>
 half of them are rejected by the manager <eos>
 she ' s extremely meticulous <eos>
 even if your daily performance is good she won ' t go easy on you <eos>
 unless you ' re 100% prepared you ' ll be in trouble <eos>
 excuse me <eos>
 but i think her way of working <eos>
 is extremely sexy <eos>
 who are you ? <eos>
 never mind <eos>
 there was an old smiling mask <eos>
 i was shocked the moment she turned around <eos>
 it felt like lightning cracked my head open <eos>
 you saw the manager of finance <eos>
 manager of finance ? <eos>
 yeah you said smiling mask <eos>
 yes <eos>
 she ' s not bad she ' s quite practical <eos>
 she listens to the newbies ' opinions <eos>
 in a nutshell she ' s openminded <eos>
 openminded ? just like ? <eos>
 ? you <eos>
 oh it ' s falling <eos>
 take care of that <eos>
 ok <eos>
 did you check the data thoroughly ? <eos>
 yes i did <eos>
 where ' s the b/l draft ? <eos>
 hello sir <eos>
 yes negotiations are under way but revisions are being made to the documents <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 bye <eos>
 mr kang <eos>
 the documents you requested <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 also mr kim wanted to ask if negotiations have started <eos>
 that ' ll be ready tomorrow <eos>
 when the invoice packing is ready ask mr kim to call me <eos>
 or you call me <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 sir is our team not going to prepare a sales proposal ? <eos>
 it ' s under way <eos>
 don ' t you worry about it <eos>
 why shouldn ' t i worry when i ' m in the steel team too ? <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 why are you doing this to me ? <eos>
 you like to make things bigger than it has to be ? <eos>
 or get attention ? <eos>
 sir ? <eos>
 what ' s with me ? <eos>
 i hope this answers you <eos>
 i don ' t think you ' re fully trained yet <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 since you still want to do it ? <eos>
 ? do this <eos>
 i just gave you work <eos>
 make an excel chart <eos>
 what ' s with your face ? <eos>
 have you seen this when you were working in resources ? <eos>
 it ' s about carbon emission rights <eos>
 this was on hold <eos>
 yes i was told to work on it for the next sales proposal <eos>
 i don ' t know why it ' s on hold <eos>
 so ? <eos>
 you said you ' d do it ? that you ' d get approval ? <eos>
 i don ' t think that ' s what resources wanted to hear from you <eos>
 just let them win <eos>
 just say " sorry i can ' t do it i need help " <eos>

 no sir <eos>
 baek ki let ' s have a drink together <eos>
 all the newbies <eos>
 thank you mr oh <eos>
 thank you mr kim <eos>
 hello <eos>
 come on <eos>
 the two alcohol lovers won ' t come i guess they ' re fine <eos>
 let ' s get out <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 this place is for having dates it ' s not a man ' s place <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you said you didn ' t want to drink <eos>
 you should ' ve consulted me with your concerns young yi <eos>
 baek ki has his own worries <eos>
 how can he be counselling you ? <eos>
 look at his face <eos>
 he looks so perplexed <eos>
 he couldn ' t refuse <eos>
 yet has nothing to say to you <eos>
 you shouldn ' t give people trouble like that <eos>
 here nice <eos>
 if i were you ? <eos>
 ? i ' d go see the finance manager <eos>
 that ' s not easy <eos>
 there are procedures to follow <eos>
 she ' s a difficult person to deal with <eos>
 her face is different from what you ' d imagine from back <eos>
 the question and answer is totally different <eos>
 it was just so shocking <eos>
 i ' m told she ' s a great person though <eos>
 she ' s practical and openminded <eos>
 she listens to the newbies too <eos>
 mr oh also said she ' s quite flexible <eos>
 don ? t be so careless about others ' business <eos>
 i understand <eos>
 it could be something that can ' t be shared with you geu rae <eos>
 procedures could be much more important than you think <eos>
 since they ' re a type of promise <eos>
 most people trust in prepare for plan and execute that promise <eos>
 i hope people who rely on those promises aren ' t fooled <eos>
 let ' s do it <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 i ' ll just do it <eos>
 they might like the newbie ' s vigor <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i agree with that <eos>
 here <eos>
 get out <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 can ' t you see i ' m working ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 you ' re newbie ahn young yi in resources dev team 1 ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i don ' t know what you want to ask me directly <eos>
 skipping your direct bosses but that ' s not right <eos>
 your bosses will get in trouble right ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 get out <eos>
 i told you not to go <eos>
 who do you think you are ? <eos>
 you went there looking all proud <eos>
 you ' re not crying are you ? <eos>
 hey <eos>
 what ' s she doing ? <eos>
 if you ' re late you ' re late <eos>
 why the excuses ? <eos>
 just forget it <eos>
 come to my office <eos>
 don ' t say sorry just don ' t make mistakes <eos>
 i ' m going see the finance manager <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 come in <eos>
 thanks for the apology email that was wonderful <eos>
 i like people who acknowledge their mistakes <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 you ' re working on the carbon emission item ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 you know finance has put it on hold for 15 years right ? <eos>
 yes i do <eos>
 did your team ask the newbie to revive it ? <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 this is our review data regarding the item <eos>
 submit a report on why you think <eos>
 we turned it down by tomorrow <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 i think it ' s a fair offer for a newbie who ignored procedures <eos>
 yes ma ' am <eos>
 make sure i can see it first thing tomorrow morning <eos>
 yes <eos>
 from our point of view <eos>
 i ' ll submit a report from finance ' s viewpoint <eos>
 as well as another report on the issue <eos>
 dang finance manager ? <eos>
 she must ' ve heard of young yi ' s rumors <eos>
 you know what she ' s like <eos>
 i ' m sure she ' s delighted looking back on her newbie days <eos>
 i ' ll see you tomorrow <eos>
 bye <eos>
 i ' ll take the year ' s difference into consideration <eos>
 i ' ll review edit and resubmit it <eos>
 yes i ' ve rechecked it it ' ll be fine <eos>
 you ' re working late and drinking coffee ? <eos>
 you should have dinner <eos>
 you ' re leaving for the day ? <eos>
 yes though it ' s embarrassing <eos>
 it can ' t be as bad as what happened to me and the finance manager <eos>
 wow so you ' re doing it <eos>
 we don ? t know yet <eos>
 i can revise it only when i know why it was rejected <eos>
 i still don ' t know yet <eos>
 i bought this when i was buying hangover tonic <eos>
 since a scar won ' t matter much <eos>
 you ' ll just scratch the scab off <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 hang in there <eos>
 you want to take a break ? <eos>
 sorry for egging you on <eos>
 i think baek ki is right <eos>
 i think it worked out for the best <eos>
 you need to kick the ball to make a goal <eos>
 that ' s true <eos>
 we ' re both suffering because of items on hold <eos>
 actually mr kim dissuaded mr oh <eos>
 since it was decided on by upper management already <eos>
 i wonder how mr oh is planning on pulling it off <eos>
 he wants to visit all the executives and pursuade them <eos>
 rethink it from the other ' s point of view and make it happen <eos>
 i think that ' s his unique strategy <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 your team ? <eos>
 ? seems tight <eos>
 rethink it from the other ' s point of view and make it happen ? <eos>
 make it happen ? <eos>
 i was imprudent <eos>
 it ' s not going well ? <eos>
 i have no clue <eos>
 i could ' ve written something fancy but i didn ' t want to be deceptive <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i apologize again <eos>
 i ' m disappointed <eos>
 i thought since you spent that much time you ' d come to a fruitful conclusion <eos>
 regardless of not being able to write it i thought about something <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 i think from each dept ' s point of view <eos>
 the interpretation of the proposal could be different <eos>
 when sales says there ' s potential <eos>
 finance could interpret it as needing further review <eos>
 similarly " positive response " <eos>
 could be interpreted as " nothing has been decided yet " <eos>
 and ? <eos>
 learning about finance ' s mechanism regarding business budget administration <eos>
 was the biggest benefit for me <eos>
 the abstract estimated profits in my head <eos>
 are reevaluated with solid grounds by finance <eos>
 there are businesses you can still pursue and others you can ' t <eos>
 also the fact that the judgment is classified <eos>
 if my proposals go on hold or get rejected <eos>
 i won ' t think about what went wrong <eos>
 but what i didn ' t satisfy <eos>
 that ' s better than the report <eos>
 you can return <eos>
 i ' ll think about the penalty <eos>
 yes <eos>
 what was your major ? <eos>
 political science ma ' am <eos>
 it suits you <eos>
 did you study accounting on your own ? <eos>
 i ' m studying now <eos>
 ok hurry up and learn it <eos>
 accounting is a language of management <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 i ' m impressed <eos>
 baek ki is the excel file ready ? <eos>
 here you go <eos>
 come here <eos>
 is there a problem ? <eos>
 i did it as you told me with the data ? <eos>
 what ' s with this new format ? <eos>
 haven ' t you been trained about our format ? <eos>
 if you can check the data i ' ll revise it later ? <eos>
 you know i ' m really busy <eos>
 who told you to do as you please ? <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 don ' t you know the order ? <eos>
 confirming data ? <eos>
 that ' s basic and you want me to waste my time here ? <eos>
 you input data and then revise the format <eos>
 what company uses that process ? <eos>
 you can leave now if you want to work for another company <eos>
 a client meeting regarding the iran item <eos>
 it started late because of their team ' s morning meeting <eos>
 and there are differences in opinions <eos>
 let ' s try to make things work out <eos>
 i have to make a report to mr oh by noon <eos>
 and mr kim has to meet a buyer at noon <eos>
 so we ' re in a hurry <eos>
 we just scanned through the points to check and left the client ' s office <eos>
 iran ' s situation is challenging but i hope they improve <eos>
 we need to review the documents if circumstances change right ? <eos>
 why you think they will ? <eos>
 i don ' t know <eos>
 it is a dilemma <eos>
 we ' re not sure if it ' s a positive or negative situation <eos>
 but mr oh thinks it ' s positive <eos>
 i hope he has a solution <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 bye <eos>
 i don ' t have time to check this again <eos>
 i ' m sure it ' s fine since conditions haven ' t changed much <eos>
 you should recheck it if you feel uneasy <eos>
 you felt uneasy during the meeting ? <eos>
 i think you should check if you feel uneasy <eos>
 just like you had a good feeling <eos>
 you should check if you don ' t <eos>
 sorry sir <eos>
 there ' s something further to check so i ' ll make a report later <eos>
 yes sorry <eos>
 nothing ' s changed right ? <eos>
 yes it ' s identical <eos>
 necessary changes have been made <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i just wasted your time <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 you know what ' s risky when doing business ? <eos>
 letting it become a race <eos>
 you just keep looking forward <eos>
 then you ' ll crash into something <eos>
 glad you mentioned that <eos>
 you ' re still here <eos>
 hi mr kim <eos>
 great timing <eos>
 let ' s go when things are looking good <eos>
 sir <eos>
 we ' ll go make the report <eos>
 bye <eos>
 one international ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 it ' s the iran employee <eos>
 the eu placed an embargo <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 you did think the embargo could be placed right ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 what about the longterm duration ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 then end of discussion forget it <eos>
 we can do it <eos>
 how ? <eos>
 the risks due to the longterm embargo are so obvious <eos>
 you know there will be bigger risks and you can do it ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 it ' s not that simple here <eos>
 there ' s no way to bring the oil in <eos>
 we can get it in through turkey <eos>
 where ? <eos>
 it ' s bordering iran they ' re on good terms with iran and not an eu nation <eos>
 iran is importing a considerable amount of energy <eos>
 so it won ' t be easy to go with the embargo <eos>
 we can buy it through a turkish company <eos>
 there is a company we ' ve worked with for a long time <eos>
 they ' re in the country <eos>
 there are different businesses with iran too <eos>
 there are circumstances but we can make a request to iran <eos>
 turkey ? <eos>
 what do you think risk team ? <eos>
 i like it <eos>
 i agree sir <eos>
 we have a solid infra with turkey <eos>
 cheers ! <eos>
 we just need the executive director ' s approval <eos>
 ok <eos>
 just the procedures are left <eos>
 good job guys <eos>
 what ' s wrong ? <eos>
 i ? what ? <eos>
 oh you don ' t look too happy <eos>
 no i am <eos>
 what is it ? tell me <eos>
 will the manager be ok ? <eos>
 he focused on the china item <eos>
 we didn ' t order that <eos>
 i ordered it <eos>
 the results will soon show <eos>
 if it ' s good data <eos>
 or not <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 go with the china item <eos>
 keep this <eos>
 they ' re our team ' s assets <eos>
 yes <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 where are you going ? <eos>
 let ' s eat meat <eos>
 we ' ll have a burner please <eos>
 this is the norm so it ' s just the beginning <eos>
 up until now it was a warm up <eos>
 will you leave the theater <eos>
 only after the trailer ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 the burner is hot now <eos>
 we should put meat on it <eos>
 just the part of the meat has changed <eos>
 sir forget about head meat <eos>
 please give us premium beef here ! <eos>
 don ' t drink it from the bottle <eos>
 what was your excuse for drinking today ? <eos>
 nice ! <eos>
 you ' re always happy alone ! <eos>
 geez <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 i was so happy i drank <eos>
 can ' t i drink ? <eos>
 i ' m going to roast grade a premium beef from now on <eos>
 drink up <eos>
 with this ? <eos>
 geez you must be crazy <eos>
 oh my ! <eos>
 hey ! come here ! <eos>
 what ' s with you ? <eos>
 i wonder how mr oh felt <eos>
 the news articles he had collected himself <eos>
 numerous memos <eos>
 cutting out the changing news of the times ? <eos>
 ? did he think the same thing as me ? <eos>
 i told them to do it last july <eos>
 mr oh started on a new item the very next day as if nothing ever happened <eos>
 did you check the circumstances with china ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' ll check and let you know <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i think around august <eos>
 i have a small box now <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 did you collect the reports from the economics research center too ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 the more my box fills up the more i will have learned <eos>
 ok let ' s gather up <eos>
 this spells trouble <eos>
 china ' s situation is so different from when we started <eos>
 china increased their importing product line <eos>
 they ' re in charge of 90% of the world ' s market with rare earth resources <eos>
 so this will make importing hard <eos>
 how come other countries don ' t go into development ? <eos>
 it can really ruin the environment <eos>
 that ' s why china has a quota system <eos>
 if you look at today ' s research center report <eos>
 it means we should stay low for now <eos>
 i think that would be smart <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 do whatever it takes <eos>
 i ' ll back you up <eos>
 the situation doesn ' t look like that will cover it <eos>
 business isn ' t easy <eos>
 everything has variables <eos>
 with the iran item you ignored the international circumstances <eos>
 why are you hesitating now ? <eos>
 you know it was reported in my name <eos>
 don ' t whine ok ? <eos>
 don ' t pull pranks because yours was rejected ! <eos>
 going forward <eos>
 not yet ? <eos>
 let ' s go forward <eos>
 mr kim the report ? <eos>
 look at this <eos>
 they ' re all saying it ' s a supercycle trend <eos>
 things aren ' t looking good <eos>
 we ' ll have to see <eos>
 set a meeting with china tomorrow <eos>
 they can come or we go <eos>
 we should recheck it <eos>
 reports keep coming in <eos>
 the dept manager used to work on this item <eos>
 we need to do it and he wants it <eos>
 i know but the circumstances have changed <eos>
 yes <eos>
 a long time has passed <eos>
 since i brought up the item on hold again <eos>
 whether if it ' s the dept manager ' s performance results or not <eos>
 i ' m the one responsible for delaying the stable item <eos>
 also worsened situations due to an aggravated environment <eos>
 it ' s our team ' s responsibility <eos>
 if you can ' t resolve this he ' ll have a hard time <eos>
 we have to do it <eos>
 honestly everyone ' s climbing up the social ladder <eos>
 he doesn ' t care about his performance ratings at all <eos>
 what we really need to see the results at this point <eos>
 i mean mr oh needs to be promoted <eos>
 let ' s do it well <eos>
 of course <eos>
 now i should be able to fulfill one man ' s workload <eos>
 you ' re alone ? <eos>
 sir <eos>
 they ' re all out ? <eos>
 yes they all just left <eos>
 tell mr oh i want to see him <eos>
 sure <eos>
 hey <eos>
 it ' s much riskier than you said <eos>
 don ? t you know china has increased their business and shifts are being made ? <eos>
 yes we ' re going to supplement that <eos>
 i ' m sure i told you the warnings when the first proposal was made <eos>
 among the three items the one you ? <eos>
 that ' s not it <eos>
 among the items you brought i said <eos>
 " let ' s try that " about the safest choice <eos>
 oh but the china item now was your idea ? <eos>
 it was just an idea <eos>
 an idea isn ' t a proposal <eos>
 is it ? <eos>
 i ' ll do well so it doesn ' t have a negative effect on you <eos>
 hey <eos>
 who do you think you are ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 anyway go ahead with your item mr oh <eos>
 make reports right away <eos>
 delete the part where it says it ' s my idea <eos>
 that ' s such a minor detail <eos>
 then what about backup for the china item ? <eos>
 don ' t you have hands to work with ? <eos>
 what backup ? <eos>
 the company is backing you up ! <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 come see me <eos>
 where are you going ? <eos>
 the dept manager wants to see me <eos>
 he wants to see the business data out of the blue <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 it ' s obvious <eos>
 he wants to take credit <eos>
 you know with our business from the briefing last time <eos>
 he was blatantly claiming your proposal was bad <eos>
 do a better job <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 he said you go a different direction from what he wants <eos>
 do a better job for him <eos>
 you should change things for improvement <eos>
 kiss up to the bosses too <eos>
 i ' m too sorry to get promoted <eos>
 yes ! <eos>
 mr oh i heard ? <eos>
 get out <eos>
 it better work <eos>
 don ? t think of the price and look <eos>
 into all the companies with quota systems <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 go with him <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 we could force it <eos>
 but all the companies with quota systems have different prices <eos>
 you could get blamed for everything <eos>
 we ' re going to change our item too <eos>
 nonquota ? <eos>
 no way it ' s smuggling <eos>
 people with those baits wouldn ' t be at big companies <eos>
 i ' m surprised there ' s 60% more smuggling <eos>
 it ' s hard to get a big quantity without smuggling <eos>
 patience is a virtue but our team can ' t afford that <eos>
 what ' s mr kim like ? <eos>
 who ? <eos>
 the dept manager <eos>
 a typical man earning a salary <eos>
 that ' s what i ' d call him <eos>
 he ' s perfect for the times <eos>
 he ' s quick and eloquent <eos>
 very sharp <eos>
 what can a company employee look forward to besides promotions ? <eos>
 do you think that ' s all there is to it too ? <eos>
 so far ? <eos>
 since i haven ' t found anything else <eos>
 let ' s save mr oh ? i mean our team first <eos>
 so obnoxious <eos>
 hello <eos>
 you should watch where you ' re going <eos>
 your lower body is weak huh ? <eos>
 a man ' s lower body is key huh ? <eos>
 use the stairs from now on not this <eos>
 aren ' t you going ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 is your foot ok ? <eos>
 what about my foot ? <eos>
 i told you to come to my team <eos>
 you ' re suffering because you didn ' t <eos>
 the carbon emission item ? <eos>
 i like it <eos>
 you can ' t make it a national business right ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 i can ' t make a profit structure that finance will pass <eos>
 when did you learn russian ? <eos>
 you seemed good <eos>
 in college <eos>
 i was an exchange student for an year <eos>
 what about you ? <eos>
 i lived there for 2 years for work <eos>
 i learned a lot then because i always loved russian <eos>
 there ' s a word for " white night " in russian you know ? <eos>
 you know the ballet dancer mikhail baryshnikov ? <eos>
 i was moved by that movie as a kid and vowed to go to russia someday <eos>
 you know their famous theater ? <eos>
 mikhail baryshnikov is dancing there <eos>
 vladimir vysotsky sings <eos>
 you don ' t know right ? <eos>
 he ' s a famous revolutionary singer <eos>
 like a wild horse <eos>
 the russian culture has tragic beauty <eos>
 it ' s a us film <eos>
 the us ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 not russian ? <eos>
 i got carried away <eos>
 i heard you left the rare earth resource case with the quota system <eos>
 mmhmm <eos>
 dang <eos>
 i didn ' t know china would be so fickle <eos>
 i go there like i drink water <eos>
 i never had a hunch <eos>
 we overlook what we think is obvious <eos>
 tell me about it <eos>
 we overlook what we think is obvious ? <eos>
 i better go <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 use that item ? <eos>
 thanks mr oh <eos>
 we overlook what we think is obvious ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 something new ? <eos>
 yes there ' s news <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 i found a solution for the rare earth resources <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 the korean resource corporation is developing them with north korea <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 estimated at 20000000 tons <eos>
 it will become twentyfold once it ' s official <eos>
 set a meeting with the planning dept your employees should come <eos>
 it ' ll be in an hour <eos>
 yes <eos>
 sir this ? <eos>
 work on it and i ' ll see to it after i ' m done with sales team 3 <eos>
 weren ' t you going to report with our item ? <eos>
 when did i say i ' d do that ? <eos>
 it started out with my item from sales team 3 ! <eos>
 but ? <eos>
 sir our manager changed his mind <eos>
 what ' s wrong with him ? <eos>
 i ' m going crazy <eos>
 it ' s just procedures <eos>
 sales team 2 ' s item will be reported too <eos>
 that ' s not the issue <eos>
 it has to be an item backed by him <eos>
 please pursuade him <eos>
 i ' ve never had such a big meeting before <eos>
 they ' re just saying it was for a meeting <eos>
 but not acknowledging it officially <eos>
 connect hotlines to the research centers government depts <eos>
 and the public corporation <eos>
 check and review the content <eos>
 the planning team uses connections to secure the latest info <eos>
 yes <eos>
 this isn ' t the time for management <eos>
 yes we ' re looking for the right timing politically <eos>
 the collected info is made <eos>
 orderly by mr oh and mr kim <eos>
 rare earth resource stocks are shaky <eos>
 of course all the meeting content is recorded <eos>
 that ' s my job <eos>
 your team should submit a progress report twice a day <eos>
 yes <eos>
 that ' s all for today <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 thanks <eos>

 looking good <eos>
 yes <eos>
 wait <eos>
 can i see that ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 rare earth resource ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why is sales team 3 dealing with the resource team ' s item ? <eos>
 it ' s the resource team ' s item <eos>
 look <eos>
 yes <eos>
 you mentioned rare earth resources last time <eos>
 oh yes <eos>
 i was going to submit a proper report <eos>
 the resource team should do it <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 it overlaps so why not combine them ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why suffer when there are pros ? <eos>
 find something that suits sales team 3 <eos>
 it ' s on me so enjoy your time <eos>

 let ' s go <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 sit over here <eos>
 take your time <eos>
 let ' s go mr ko <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yes <eos>
 sir <eos>
 sir <eos>
 let ' s eat <eos>
 i ' m hungry <eos>
 we started eating without a word <eos>
 we were suddenly starving <eos>
 we had to eat something <eos>
 i learned why we had to get drunk <eos>
 and ? <eos>

 ? i ' m sorry <eos>
 she ' ll kill me <eos>
 she must ' ve changed the number <eos>

 why do you drink every day ? <eos>
 every single day ! <eos>
 can ' t you stop drinking ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 because it ' s tasty <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 do you know that taste ? <eos>
 dang <eos>
 do you guys know that taste ? <eos>
 do you ? <eos>
 if you want to accomplish something health should be your priority <eos>
 the reason you lag towards the end <eos>
 the reason you recover slowly from damage <eos>
 and the reason a mistake affects you for so long <eos>
 are all because you ' re health is not at the best <eos>
 when you ' re unfit you want to be comfortable and you lose patience <eos>
 then you become so tired <eos>
 you don ' t care about victories <eos>
 if you want to win your body <eos>
 should be able to withstand your challenges <eos>
 will power is nothing without your body health <eos>
 what do you do on the weekends ? <eos>
 i watch movies <eos>

 the arab mecca phone item ? <eos>
 it ' s worth $3 mil <eos>
 the it sales team was on it so it ' s nearly prepared <eos>

 i can ' t do it <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you know what he ' s like <eos>
 give me a job i can do <eos>
 hey you earn a salary so how can you say that ? <eos>

 resignation ? <eos>
 dong sik ' s issue affected our dept ' s performance <eos>
 ok if you sign the deal i ' ll get you more people <eos>

 did you say you wouldn ' t do it ? <eos>
 anyway he said we ' d get more people <eos>
 can ' t you just do it ? <eos>
 he has to do it <eos>
 what is he worried about then ? <eos>
 i can ' t commit a crime as a dad <eos>
 this is just like embezzlement <eos>
 i think it ' s different <eos>
 it ' s worse man ! <eos>
 ok if you say so but my question is <eos>
 did you say you ' d do it or not ? <eos>
 you want to be stubborn with that absurd reason ? <eos>
 alright <eos>
 from now on i ' ll give your team all the sales headquarters ' work <eos>
 repair those damages from now on ! <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 that ' s just absurd ! <eos>
 it ' s the mecca phone data from it sales <eos>
 but ? <eos>
 the agency list is here too <eos>
 so we have to do it <eos>
 call them to check the progress <eos>
 models and make applications <eos>
 yes <eos>
 we could be doomed <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 what will you do ? <eos>
 we have to do it <eos>
 we need to find a solution <eos>
 a way to make him give up <eos>
 dong sik <eos>

 it was weird <eos>
 mr oh took on any job <eos>
 i wonder why not this one <eos>
 he has a unique character <eos>
 character <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 mr mun ? <eos>
 he has a big distribution company in the middle east <eos>
 it ' s a big client <eos>
 they ' re a key partner <eos>
 then why is mr oh ? <eos>
 mr mun is quirky <eos>
 so everyone avoids him <eos>
 so it ' s of little interest from our point of view <eos>
 look <eos>
 why do you think it sales told us to <eos>
 have it forsaking their performance ? <eos>
 is he fussy ? <eos>
 you just ? have to <eos>
 make things happen you know <eos>
 mr oh ' s character ? <eos>
 this goes against his principles <eos>
 principles ? what principles ? <eos>
 oh ! <eos>
 ok <eos>
 let ' s get sick <eos>
 i bought expired milk as you asked me to <eos>
 good <eos>
 i also put it under the sun for <eos>
 three hours as you asked me to <eos>
 good <eos>
 what will you do with this ? <eos>
 drink it <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 if we get food poisoning he can ' t make us do it <eos>
 mr oh ! <eos>
 drink it <eos>
 how can we drink this ? <eos>
 drink it <eos>
 you have to <eos>
 ok <eos>
 you still have some <eos>
 man <eos>
 is it coming out ? <eos>
 no it was dirty <eos>
 i ' m not getting any signals <eos>
 me neither <eos>
 are you sure it was expired ? <eos>
 yes i ' m sure sir <eos>
 is your stomach fine too mr oh ? <eos>
 dang lactic acid bacteria ! <eos>
 he said " principle " <eos>
 principle <eos>
 work is everything for us <eos>
 so i wonder what principle could possibly go against it <eos>
 is there such a thing ? <eos>
 yes sales team 3 oh sang sik <eos>
 hello <eos>
 this is madam cha at jangwon <eos>
 we had our grand opening in shinsadong <eos>
 i called to say hi <eos>
 why are you calling this office ? <eos>
 jangwon ? <eos>
 oh sang sik speaking <eos>
 hello mr oh sang sik kim dong sik speaking <eos>
 we ' ve renovated our place in bangbaedong <eos>
 not interested <eos>
 i ' ll tell him <eos>
 geez <eos>
 i ' ll call you back <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 it ' s mr lee from a luxury lounge in seochodong <eos>
 he said he ' d give you a 20% discount <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 rumors must ' ve spread last time with the it sales team <eos>
 excuse me <eos>
 are you mr oh sang sik ? <eos>
 yes i am <eos>
 i ' m michelle jang of partners cooperation <eos>
 i want to be your business partner <eos>
 but what is ? <eos>
 ms bae <eos>
 you ' ll be doing business with ceo <eos>
 mr mun in the arab correct ? <eos>
 we sealed the contract last year <eos>
 entertaining him with sales team 1 <eos>
 you can ignore all the calls you ' ve received <eos>
 partners cooperation will be your best partner <eos>
 from limousine pickup service <eos>
 to any service the vip wants <eos>
 we ' ll satisfy all your needs <eos>
 of course <eos>
 round 2 also satisfaction guaranteed <eos>
 just overlook it this time buddy ok ? <eos>
 don ' t you feel sorry for dong sik ? <eos>
 his face looks like a sick chicken now <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 mr kim promised to get you more people right ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 mun chung gi making a dirty mess at the bar is one thing <eos>
 there ' s a reason mr oh hates entertaining him <eos>
 he ' s always wants round 2 <eos>
 round 2 ? <eos>
 it ' s illegal of course <eos>
 some buyers want that even these days <eos>
 mr oh won ' t do it because of his principles not just the laws <eos>
 principles <eos>
 so what do you mean ? <eos>
 well he told me a few times <eos>
 so it has to do with human rights <eos>
 human dignity something ? <eos>
 so i can ' t explain it <eos>
 mr oh ' s principle is he won ' t <eos>
 ever entertain them with round 2 <eos>
 so he puts people above work ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 it ' s so frustrating <eos>
 honestly this is a team effort and there ' s no such thing as principles <eos>
 you do what you have to <eos>
 if we just pull this off <eos>
 this quarter ' s performance will be good <eos>
 eat it <eos>
 i ' m good <eos>
 hello mr oh <eos>
 hey <eos>
 what are you worried about ? <eos>
 just finish with round 1 <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 get him drunk and sign the deal it ' s simple <eos>
 he ' ll be down with round 1 <eos>
 the mecca phone item is a headache right ? <eos>
 i know everything <eos>
 i want to help you since i ' m smart regarding that area <eos>
 unfortunately i ' m so busy myself <eos>
 baek ki ! <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 i want to help him too <eos>
 there ' s no solution <eos>
 i hope he doesn ' t get different ideas <eos>
 you can leave now if you want <eos>
 to work at a different company <eos>
 i ' m lee ji hyun at headhunting firm search & brains <eos>
 i ' d like to recommend good companies <eos>
 if you ' re thinking of changing jobs <eos>
 great timing <eos>
 hey about the carbon emission item <eos>
 finance gave approval <eos>
 the day has finally come <eos>
 whose business shall we make it ? <eos>
 let ' s make it yours <eos>
 it was originally your plan <eos>
 young yi just added russian photos <eos>
 she made the crucial hit <eos>
 so do it together <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 no she can do it herself <eos>
 why you ! <eos>
 that ' s absurd <eos>
 she ' s smart but still a newbie <eos>
 she can ' t do it alone <eos>
 i can ' t work with her ! <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 you think i want to give her work ? <eos>
 this could be a big success <eos>
 think of the team ! <eos>
 finance gave approval ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 good job <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 mr ha ' s in charge so support him well <eos>
 ok i ' ll do my best <eos>
 sir <eos>
 let ' s talk <eos>
 tell him you can ' t do it <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 don ' t feign ignorance <eos>
 you thought i ' d want to work with you ? <eos>
 i ' ll support you well <eos>
 hey don ' t you get it ? <eos>
 " i ' ll support you well " ? <eos>
 you want to act cool to the end ? <eos>
 sir ? <eos>
 tell him you can ' t do it <eos>
 if you ' re a part of our team <eos>
 don ' t cause any more trouble ! <eos>
 don ' t you feel sorry for dong sik ? <eos>
 his face looks like a sick chicken now <eos>
 one international kim dong sik speaking <eos>
 yes hello <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' m not sure about that matter <eos>
 i ' ll check and call you back <eos>
 yes bye <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr kim promised to get you more people right ? <eos>
 dong sik ! <eos>
 yes ? <eos>
 let ' s do it ! <eos>
 yes <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 let ' s do it <eos>
 do it ! <eos>
 let ' s do it ! <eos>
 i ' ll seal the deal by round 1 <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 tell suk yool to come <eos>
 i ' ll start now <eos>
 this is the entertainment strategy for mecca phone ceo mun chung gi <eos>
 his trade insurance corporation grade is a <eos>
 his occupation ? <eos>
 i know <eos>
 that ' s not important <eos>
 this is the list of people who failed to sign the contract with him <eos>
 they have one thing in common <eos>
 they all couldn ' t or wouldn ' t entertain him with round 2 <eos>
 when they did have round 2 <eos>
 they all signed the deal <eos>
 or had a positive response <eos>
 none of them signed after round 1 ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 ok what ' s the possibility he ' ll <eos>
 sign it when he ' s drunk after round 1 ? <eos>
 the answer is we don ' t know <eos>
 he ' s never been dead drunk <eos>
 let ' s say he happened to get hammered <eos>
 he ' s laidback <eos>
 liberal and a big bluff <eos>
 he might feel good <eos>
 so it could be possible <eos>
 that ' s the alternative we have for now <eos>
 ok <eos>
 like i said before the problem is <eos>
 he ' s never been hammered <eos>
 how ' s his tolerance ? <eos>
 for a 40% degrees whiskey ? <eos>
 he has to have three bottles of 40% degrees <eos>
 whiskeys within 15 hours to get drunk <eos>
 so it ' s a bottle per hour just make it simple <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 we must get him to sign by round 1 <eos>
 we can ' t get drunk first <eos>
 sorry i ' m late <eos>
 things ran late <eos>
 the seating is key <eos>
 mr oh will sit here and mr kim on the opposite side <eos>
 geu rae will sit next to mr kim <eos>
 mr mun will sit in the seat of honor ? <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 sorry <eos>
 glad you ' re here young yi <eos>
 later mr oh <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 this is mr mun <eos>
 she can ' t be him <eos>
 aren ' t you busy ? <eos>
 i am excuse me <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 mr oh will pour mr mun a drink <eos>
 next you will mr kim <eos>
 while he ' s drinking mr oh ? excuse me <eos>
 you ' ll act like you ' re taking a phone call and leave <eos>
 in this chaotic moment ? geu rae <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 then you go <eos>
 so he ' s drinking three shots while we drink one ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 good idea <eos>
 but <eos>
 this can ' t last forever <eos>
 prepare two bottles of whiskey from the getgo <eos>
 one is real and one is black tea <eos>
 after mr mun pours all of you a drink <eos>
 geu rae pours him one <eos>
 mr kim will then change it with a shot of black tea <eos>
 wet towels and trashcans to throw out the alcohol are essential here <eos>
 you act like you ' re drinking it then you spit it out <eos>
 the wet towel can ' t absorb too much <eos>
 so if you spit it out before absorption it will get messy <eos>
 the key to the trick is the absorption <eos>
 so keep many dry towels similar to the wet one <eos>
 you need to put empty glasses in your pocket <eos>
 to change them with full shots <eos>
 you need to act drunk <eos>
 and remember to call each other every 30 minutes to rotate seats <eos>
 boilermakers are seven times as strong as normal alcohol <eos>
 learn how to make them it ' ll make things exciting <eos>
 see now you get it ? <eos>

 rainbow alcohol gold liquor and cappuccino liquor <eos>
 ok geu rae <eos>
 learn how to make boilermakers from him <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>

 who are you young yi ? <eos>
 principle ? <eos>
 why are you laughing ? <eos>
 i feel like looking at an old <eos>
 watch in an antique store <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 the word " principle " <eos>
 nowadays college professors who mention <eos>
 " social justice " get the same response <eos>
 mr oh still has it <eos>
 or he ' s struggling to keep his soul alive <eos>
 mr oh ? <eos>
 you really won ' t prepare round 2 ? <eos>
 mr oh what if ? <eos>
 no ! <eos>
 get all the info you can about mun including receipts <eos>
 why you i ' ll do whatever it takes <eos>
 to make you sign it by round 1 <eos>

 can ' t you see how other team newbies are working ? <eos>
 their names are already on the next sales proposal even geu ? <eos>
 sir <eos>

 he ' s the guy who made mr oh bring up that old word <eos>
 i ' m kim dong sik <eos>
 i ' m jang geu rae <eos>
 this way please <eos>
 ok <eos>
 will mr oh be able to keep his principle as intended ? <eos>
 wow <eos>
 the match was over sooner than we thought <eos>
 sir i ' ll pour you a drink <eos>
 we had a different operation location to work with <eos>
 we panicked even before we could load our guns <eos>
 oh excuse me <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 hold on hello ? <eos>
 hold on ? hello ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 the most meticulous plan in the history <eos>
 of alcohol entertainment with clients <eos>
 was ruined before it even started <eos>
 in front of the heaviest drinker on earth <eos>
 here <eos>
 ok <eos>
 the boilermaker recipe i learned <eos>
 at the last minute was useless <eos>
 this is a water fountain <eos>
 wow <eos>
 round 2 ! <eos>
 round 2 ! <eos>
 we will party till the break of dawn here you go <eos>
 ok <eos>
 mr kim couldn ' t tell which was <eos>
 whiskey and which was black tea <eos>
 mr oh was still struggling to get <eos>
 the contract signed by round 1 <eos>
 here ' s me <eos>
 we realized when the clock hit 4:00 in the morning <eos>
 we had totally failed <eos>
 mr oh ' s heart will <eos>
 cry a river of tears all night <eos>
 hey <eos>
 41 59//our youngest one right ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 you can go now <eos>
 you ' re quick mr oh <eos>
 ok go home <eos>
 wait ! <eos>
 what ' s with it ? <eos>
 i don ' t have time for this <eos>
 please sir ! <eos>
 don ' t worry ! <eos>
 you too don ' t worry <eos>
 good job <eos>
 where ' s dong sik ? <eos>
 dong sik <eos>
 dong sik ! <eos>
 dude ! <eos>
 get up <eos>
 send dong sik home <eos>
 you go home too <eos>
 get a couple of hours of sleep <eos>
 what ? about you ? <eos>
 dang <eos>
 wait <eos>
 mr oh failed <eos>
 but sales team 3 survived <eos>
 " survived " my foot we were in trouble <eos>
 big trouble ! <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 we ' re in big trouble <eos>
 how could that happen ? <eos>
 you ' re awake <eos>
 you ' re surprised ? <eos>
 how ? did you ? <eos>
 i sent her there <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 that quenches my thirst so well <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 man <eos>
 you thought i ' d do whatever he wants ? <eos>
 you sent his wife ? <eos>
 it ' s all in the data <eos>
 data research is always crucial <eos>
 the key is in the data <eos>
 in some of the economy news on mun chung gi <eos>
 they said he ' d be arriving with his wife <eos>
 i happened to see his anniversary <eos>
 it happened to be the same day we were entertaining him <eos>
 that made my blood boil for a minute <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 he was going to screw around on his anniversary <eos>
 ideas boiled in my head at the same time <eos>
 regarding the round 2 readiness you mentioned <eos>
 i ' m sure i said preparations not readiness <eos>
 i wanted to give his poor wife <eos>
 an unforgettable anniversary gift <eos>
 i met her on the morning of that day <eos>
 and told her about our gift for her <eos>
 you mean " your " gift <eos>
 then everything happened perfectly after that <eos>
 we failed perfectly you mean <eos>
 how could this happen ? <eos>
 gosh ! <eos>
 what guy would want to be entertained by his wife ? <eos>
 so you chose your principle <eos>
 instead of the contract <eos>
 what will you tell mr kim ? <eos>
 dang you ' re crazy ! <eos>
 are you insane ? <eos>
 sang sik you might as well jump off a bridge ! <eos>
 as long as i ' m in headquarters <eos>
 you will never get more people ! <eos>
 i told you before <eos>
 repair the damages made by all the sales headquarters ! <eos>
 all of it ! <eos>
 everything ! <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 dad ! <eos>
 my baby future tradingman ! <eos>
 dad are you coming home early tonight ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 then buy some spicy chicken on the way <eos>
 just spicy chicken ? <eos>
 what about fried chicken ? <eos>
 then make it fried <eos>
 only fried chicken ? <eos>
 what about spicy ? <eos>
 then buy half and half <eos>
 then shall i buy two halfhalf chickens ? <eos>
 then you can just buy one spicy and one fried <eos>
 right <eos>
 you ' re dumb dad ! <eos>
 hey don ' t call your dad dumb <eos>
 i love you dad bye ! <eos>
 i love you <eos>
 oh gosh <eos>
 i feel so down <eos>
 blood dang ? <eos>
 dad <eos>
 buy one halfhalf and one spicy <eos>
 from your no 1 son <eos>
 you were here ? you weren ' t picking up your phone <eos>
 you had a nosebleed ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 are you ok ? <eos>
 i dozed off for a few minutes <eos>
 now i ' m bleeding <eos>
 you dozed off ? <eos>
 i don ? t know if i dozed off or fainted <eos>
 maybe my blood pressure rose because of fatigue <eos>
 i ' m ok <eos>
 don ' t tell dong sik anything <eos>
 i don ' t want to hear him nag <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why are you looking at the euets data ? <eos>
 what are you trying to do ? <eos>
 what do you take me for ? <eos>
 i told you to butt out <eos>
 you ' re trying to get on my nerves ? <eos>
 you ' re saying it ' s yours and you have the right ? <eos>
 that ' s not it sir <eos>
 if you can ' t drop it ? <eos>
 fine take it <eos>
 i don ' t have to do it <eos>
 put your frigging name in the center and succeed ! <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 keep your chin up <eos>
 everyone knows losers act like that <eos>
 guys can be the biggest losers <eos>
 more so around talented women <eos>
 be strong since you ' re not at fault <eos>
 when you pulled off the 2yearold item as an intern <eos>
 rumors of your legendary talent spread everywhere <eos>
 go back to that young yi <eos>
 keep your chin up and be proud <eos>
 be strong <eos>
 that ' s more like you <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i ' ll do as you said <eos>
 as you said i ' ll keep out of it <eos>
 i ' ll run your errands <eos>
 while you ' re on that item <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 send us your resume by midnight <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 is the document i asked for ready ? <eos>
 i ' ll wrap it up so you can have it by tomorrow <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 i won ' t stop you if you want to quit <eos>
 steel is a conservative business <eos>
 a single item changes gradually adjusting to the business market <eos>
 over a long term <eos>
 so for our team members <eos>
 rather than someone who is eloquent and focused on instant results <eos>
 we need someone with basic skills <eos>
 who can look far into the horizon <eos>
 so <eos>
 are you telling me you ' ve taught me basic skills so far ? <eos>
 then i ' ve certainly been mistreated <eos>
 i ' ve learned the basics in school as an intern and work training <eos>
 teaching me the basics <eos>
 is just an excuse <eos>
 i think you just don ? t like me <eos>
 see you tomorrow <eos>
 i want to hear it this time <eos>
 how come you don ' t like me ? <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 it ' s not a matter of liking someone or not <eos>
 i don ' t even know you that well <eos>
 then what is it ? <eos>
 don ' t you remember the first thing you did <eos>
 after you were assigned to the team ? <eos>
 sir <eos>
 i developed a profitable idea for the steel team <eos>
 are you talking about the business item report ? <eos>
 i think training includes the time to check what one has learned <eos>
 there ' s a big pile of files for a newbie to learn but you <eos>
 gave me a business report as soon as you came <eos>
 before you even read the steel item files <eos>
 if you try to stand out from the crowd <eos>
 you become hasty <eos>
 if the basic skills are so important <eos>
 why didn ' t you tell me from the start ? <eos>
 i gave you many chances to see your own <eos>
 mistakes i don ' t know about others <eos>
 but that ' s my style <eos>
 chances ? <eos>
 you call making graphs and <eos>
 checking typos " chances ? " <eos>
 can ' t i learn more by working <eos>
 together with the team ? <eos>
 you have a long way to go <eos>
 you ' re off for the day ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 bye <eos>
 i decided to take your advice <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 i decided to give in as you said <eos>
 i realized what beats a strong spear <eos>
 is not a stronger spear or a shield <eos>
 you found your solution <eos>
 and i found mine <eos>
 shouldn ' t you drink ginseng instead of onion juice ? <eos>
 she ' ll buy it for me next month after kids <eos>
 give it to me <eos>
 why are you sweating so much ? <eos>
 it ' s weird <eos>
 shouldn ' t you go see a doctor ? <eos>
 i ' m just hot <eos>
 i ' ll get some rest <eos>
 sure <eos>
 this won ' t do <eos>
 i ' ll go get some air dong sik <eos>
 yes <eos>
 answer any calls for me <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 what ' s wrong with me ? <eos>
 where on earth is mr oh ? <eos>
 he went out for some air because he was dizzy <eos>
 he ' s not picking up his phone <eos>
 dizzy ? <eos>
 he must ' ve overworked himself <eos>

 he ' s the legend of the jordan export contract <eos>
 shouldn ' t be so arrogant ? <eos>
 he ' s a part of sales team 3 now <eos>
 we didn ' t learn how to express our feelings in school <eos>
 they ' re not dating are they ? what do you think ? <eos>
 i don ' t know <eos>
 oh ! <eos>
 you ' re the pretty face of our place <eos>
 what did you do to spread those dirty rumors ? <eos>
 i ' m going to quit <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 hello <eos>
 we ' re on the same team <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 you always seem like the perfect worker <eos>
 i ' m jang geu rae <eos>
 oh the contract worker with connections ? <eos>
 i heard you only have a ged <eos>
 you ' re lucky <eos>
 how did he make it ? <eos>
 i heard he ' s not even competent <eos>
 my seat ? <eos>
 where is it ? <eos>
 it ' s here right ? <eos>
 whose is this ? <eos>
 let ' s make a good team <eos>
 what are you saying ? <eos>
 send another man please <eos>
 if you can ' t you don ' t need to send anyone over <eos>
 hey <eos>
 why are you acting like a kid ? <eos>
 i ' m saying i need someone to help the team <eos>
 that ' s mr park <eos>
 you can ' t find anyone better nowadays <eos>
 even when i was with resource <eos>
 he brought in all the profits <eos>
 no one is a perfect fit <eos>
 you need to get used to each other <eos>
 work is the priority <eos>
 hey <eos>
 i heard you recommended mr park <eos>
 yes isn ' t he talented ? <eos>
 what ' s with you ? <eos>
 you want me to clean up a mess ? <eos>
 mess ? <eos>
 i have ears too <eos>
 i hear the rumors also <eos>
 do you think i don ' t know you suffered when you worked with him ? <eos>
 i just thought he was good <eos>
 but he didn ' t suit our team <eos>
 i think he was like that due <eos>
 to my lack of leadership <eos>
 sounds like you would even sacrifice <eos>
 yourself to send him away <eos>
 ged <eos>
 yes <eos>
 come here <eos>
 i heard you never went to college <eos>
 a ragstoriches story isn ' t it ? <eos>
 interesting <eos>
 how did you pull off the entrance presentation ? <eos>
 mr kim did you give out <eos>
 the tasks in advance ? <eos>
 you won ' t know how to do anything <eos>
 you ' re pretty so you can be the face of our place <eos>
 looks are key to sales positions <eos>
 so keep your chin up <eos>
 you have a girlfriend don ' t you ? show me her picture <eos>
 come on <eos>
 you can get familiar later get organized first <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 pay me some respect in <eos>
 front of the subordinates <eos>
 save me some face here <eos>
 what did they call you before ? <eos>
 of course ? <eos>
 how did you address mr park when he was in your team ? <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i don ? t think i was out of line <eos>
 sure sure <eos>
 you didn ' t have to check that <eos>
 why are you standing there ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 why were you just standing there ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 yeah how could you possibly put up with him ? <eos>
 why did they send mr park of all people ? <eos>
 we ' re in big trouble <eos>
 geu rae <eos>

 i ' ve only been here for three days <eos>
 i haven ' t gotten myself oriented yet <eos>
 when will i read all these papers ? <eos>
 this will just be super tight <eos>
 this one won ' t be worth the effort <eos>
 ged <eos>
 you did this ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 this is no good <eos>
 you need more than ambition for the middle east <eos>
 then think of some plausible items <eos>
 you didn ' t hear me did you ? <eos>
 i haven ' t gotten myself oriented yet <eos>
 even with poker when you join midgame <eos>
 you take your time for that <eos>

 i think you should just leave too <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 don ? t ever butt in my business like this again <eos>
 i didn ' t mean " give in " like this <eos>
 letting them have their way is your solution ? <eos>

 i chose to do that <eos>
 that ' s not right <eos>
 then what can i do ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 tell me if you know <eos>
 working hard doesn ' t work <eos>
 and i can ' t just do nothing <eos>
 what else can i do ? <eos>
 we didn ' t learn in school how to approach to those <eos>

 that ' s why <eos>
 that ' s why i ' m just doing what i can <eos>
 i mean whatever i can <eos>

 you ' re neglecting your work <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 we should work <eos>
 halal ? <eos>
 shall i work on this ? <eos>
 as prescribed by muslim law <eos>
 you think it ' s good ? <eos>
 arabic term meaning " lawful or permissible " ] <eos>
 well it ' s not a big item <eos>
 it ' s perfect for learning about the middle east <eos>
 i think it ' s ok for sales team 3 ? <eos>
 ok then <eos>
 i can ' t do it alone <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 yes <eos>
 give me geu rae he ' ll do <eos>
 he ' s still ? <eos>
 no ? <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 you can ' t do it ? <eos>
 i don ' t need great support <eos>
 i ' ll give him something that only requires a ged <eos>
 you have a ged <eos>
 aren ' t i right ? <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 if you allow it i ' ll support mr park <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 what are you saying ? <eos>
 who ' s higher here mr oh or mr park ? <eos>
 listen to yourself talking <eos>
 dong sik <eos>
 come on don ' t make this an issue dude <eos>
 " dude ? " <eos>
 don ' t call me " dude " sir <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 stop <eos>
 this team is all messed up <eos>
 subordinates talking back to those who are higher <eos>
 wow <eos>
 things are looking good <eos>
 you ' re close already ? <eos>
 hello mr kim <eos>
 hi how do you like your team ? <eos>
 i look forward to fantastic teamwork <eos>
 this team is important <eos>
 work hard <eos>
 i did my best to send you here <eos>
 yes i ' ll keep that in mind <eos>
 ok <eos>
 sir <eos>
 where do you go to shoot pool nowadays ? <eos>
 i sprained my wrist last time <eos>
 oh <eos>
 so i ' m taking a break now <eos>
 are you ok ? <eos>
 i ' m ok <eos>
 anyway i have high hopes <eos>
 see you later <eos>
 see you sir <eos>
 you shouldn ' t screw me over like this <eos>
 he used to be a good worker <eos>
 he ' ll help our team as a middle eastern expert <eos>
 i know <eos>
 he was the legend in the steel team <eos>
 with $120000 jordan export contract <eos>
 that was steel ' s best achievement <eos>
 mr park was amazing then <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 he was an assistant manager <eos>
 and in charge of communication with the site workers <eos>
 he was hands down the contract pro <eos>
 that ' s when things started to get risky <eos>
 let ' s take him <eos>
 he ' s a part of sales team 3 now <eos>
 we should accept our members no matter what <eos>
 it ' s your frigging luck <eos>
 come on <eos>
 support him well with the halal item starting tomorrow <eos>
 be patient <eos>
 you ' re good at that <eos>
 being patient <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 mr oh i don ' t like that either <eos>
 geu rae what ' s with you ? <eos>
 of course you can be told off for lacking skills at work <eos>
 but personal insults are a different issue <eos>
 you should say no if you don ' t like it <eos>
 people would think you have no pride <eos>
 support him well with the halal item starting tomorrow <eos>
 be patient <eos>
 you ' re good at that <eos>
 being patient <eos>
 i don ' t like that either <eos>
 geu rae what ' s with you ? <eos>
 of course you can be told off for lacking skills at work <eos>
 but personal insults are a different issue <eos>
 you should say no if you don ' t like it <eos>
 people would think you have no pride <eos>
 jumping down a bridge doesn ' t mean you ' re courageous <eos>
 i heard you only have a ged <eos>
 ignoring a path which makes you want to jump down a bridge <eos>
 and going your own path requires courage too <eos>
 it ' s not smart to respond immediately when there ' s trouble <eos>
 when you keep your cool while your opponent doesn ? t <eos>
 ultimately gives them trouble <eos>
 if you allow it i ' ll support mr park <eos>
 so keeping my cool is the best way <eos>
 to defend myself and attack others <eos>
 hold on ! <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 oh it ' s baek ki <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 you were an intern with resource right ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 what was mr park like ? <eos>
 you must know since he was in resource ? <eos>
 you want me to badmouth my boss ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 i ' m sorry if that ' s how you took it <eos>
 he ' ll be a bit <eos>
 hard for you to handle <eos>
 i can imagine how he treats you <eos>
 but don ' t take it personally <eos>
 that will make it easier for you <eos>
 just ignore him <eos>
 it ' s the halal meat distribution list <eos>
 already ? <eos>
 wow <eos>
 you ' re really unqualified but a competent newbie <eos>
 how did you find it ? <eos>
 i got the contacts from another team who did a halal item <eos>
 i called the arabrelated companies and asked if they could do it <eos>
 i ' m impressed <eos>
 i ' ll be asking for easy support <eos>
 but you should know the basics <eos>
 basics i mean the basics <eos>
 you should know the trade terms for example <eos>
 you know what as is ? <eos>
 we ' re not talking about aftersales service <eos>
 they ' re conditions to provide when a promissory note is presented <eos>
 i ' m impressed <eos>
 volume rate ? <eos>
 a discount on large freight <eos>
 it ' s a cheap rate you apply on the transport charges <eos>
 as the number of containers increase <eos>
 knockdown <eos>
 a method of assembling and selling a machine in parts <eos>
 the custom rate is higher than the parts and it ' s economical <eos>
 for nations with low labor costs so it ' s profitable for the importer <eos>
 w/m <eos>
 a standard for transport charge calculation <eos>
 whether to use weight or volume is the ship company ' s choice <eos>
 hello mr jang <eos>
 we consider halal food to be contaminated when they come into contact <eos>
 with any nonhalal food <eos>
 i understand the packaging process <eos>
 but not the storage procedures <eos>
 please provide us with the specifics <eos>
 for the storage procedure for your suggestion <eos>
 how will you reply to that buyer ' s request ? <eos>
 you don ' t understand ? <eos>
 english is a basic skill for a trading company <eos>
 what should we do about him ? <eos>
 there ' s no solution <eos>
 good job <eos>

 arrogant jerk <eos>
 yes mr kang <eos>

 baek ki <eos>

 he can ' t come in today <eos>
 he can ' t ? <eos>

 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 the epc tf budget changed <eos>
 finance needs approval from each team today <eos>
 steel will need to submit it too <eos>

 mr kim yes <eos>
 i ' m doing good <eos>
 yes things are going well right ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i changed my team <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 let ' s talk <eos>
 is it because of your name ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 you just keep saying " yes " to <eos>
 everything because that ' s what " geu rae " means ? <eos>
 if you can ' t do it say " no " since it ' s ok <eos>
 i ' m not just talking about mr park <eos>
 once you start working your true colors are bound to show <eos>
 when you face frustrations <eos>
 but not in your case <eos>
 you always obey without a single complaint <eos>
 it seems like you ' re ready to accept anything <eos>
 like a longterm prisoner who was released <eos>
 like you ' re struggling to adjust to society ? <eos>
 that was too much <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 but you ' re really like that <eos>
 i don ' t know your past <eos>
 i just know you have a ged and haven ' t done anything so far <eos>
 what kind of past can make you this <eos>
 cooperative and selfsacrificing ? <eos>
 you know ? <eos>
 i want to get to know you <eos>
 better in the near future <eos>
 see you soon <eos>
 get some sleep <eos>
 you worked all night and coordinated the breakfast <eos>

 assistant managers usually take care of the breakfast <eos>
 good job <eos>
 mr sung must have it hard too <eos>
 working all night and the business trip too <eos>
 working all night ? <eos>
 why did he volunteer to go on the unnecessary business trip ? <eos>
 unnecessary business trip ? <eos>
 i wonder how far the canada polyester items are coming along <eos>

 new generation newbies are no good <eos>

 watch what you say ! <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 we got a reply for the report to finance <eos>
 alright <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 no reason for finance to hold off on it ? <eos>
 kim sun joo ? <eos>
 " no reason for finance to hold off <eos>
 on it " is the way she words it <eos>
 it means you should find the reason yourself <eos>
 it means the basics are missing or it ' s good <eos>
 but something key is missing <eos>
 that ' s the usual case <eos>
 i see <eos>
 i ' m sure you have the basics <eos>
 doublecheck what ' s missing <eos>
 yes sir <eos>

 a big pushover <eos>
 a tormented maid <eos>
 a stressed out guy <eos>
 as well as me <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 dang young yi <eos>
 attack them <eos>
 what did i say ? <eos>
 you have to be strong <eos>
 you know what they say ? <eos>
 it ' s not smart to respond immediately when there ' s trou ? <eos>
 when you keep your cool while your opponent doesn ? t <eos>
 ultimately gives them trouble <eos>
 what ' s he saying ? <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 i ' m lee ji hyun at headhunting firm search & brains <eos>
 i called to confirm your interview for tomorrow <eos>

 bye <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 i heard you got rejected by finance <eos>
 yes <eos>
 also you don ' t know why <eos>
 right <eos>
 i just went there <eos>
 is this it ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 you shouldn ' t write out the schedule like this <eos>
 make a chart for the approval format <eos>
 you should have calculated the man month <eos>
 you only have the cost and you don ' t know how many people <eos>
 you need to calculate it <eos>
 this new format is mighty refreshing <eos>
 what ' s this new format ? <eos>
 didn ' t you learn our format during training ? <eos>
 submit a revised version <eos>
 finance keeps mentioning it <eos>
 i guess the smiling masked witch is nagging them <eos>
 keep it up <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 refreshing <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 even geu rae doesn ' t do that <eos>
 mr oh <eos>

 see you tomorrow <eos>
 i ' ll see you tomorrow <eos>
 it seems like you ' re <eos>
 ready to accept anything <eos>
 like a longterm prisoner who was released <eos>
 like you ' re struggling to adjust to society ? <eos>
 a longterm prisoner who was released <eos>
 what ' s wrong with that ? <eos>
 i ' m showing everything now <eos>
 why is the past necessary ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 where are you mr kim ? <eos>
 the subway station <eos>
 could you wait for me ? <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 i have something to show you <eos>
 oh <eos>
 this way <eos>
 great view <eos>
 tiring isn ' t it ? <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 my house <eos>
 here ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 hi mom <eos>
 you ' re early <eos>
 have dinner <eos>
 i cooked mackerel <eos>
 i made a mistake and the tail smells fishy <eos>
 it ' s always smelly <eos>
 so let ' s decide who will eat the tail now <eos>
 don ' t think the mom should always eat it <eos>
 let ' s do rock paper scissors <eos>
 this is my team ' s mr kim <eos>
 hello ma ' am <eos>
 oh <eos>
 your boss is here <eos>
 did you have dinner ? <eos>
 i ' m fine i ' ll leave soon <eos>
 he wanted to show me something <eos>
 show him what ? <eos>
 maybe a hidden bride or something ? <eos>
 maybe not <eos>
 why you ! <eos>
 what are you up to ? <eos>
 what are you up to to have <eos>
 such dirty rumors spreading ? <eos>
 ma ' am ! <eos>
 that was a joke ! <eos>
 joke ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 that was a joke <eos>
 i know <eos>
 yes <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 i was joking too <eos>
 this is what i call a real joke <eos>
 you should work on your jokes <eos>
 it ' s neither funny or touching <eos>
 let ' s go in mr kim <eos>
 let ' s eat mom <eos>
 i ' m sorry ? <eos>
 excuse me <eos>
 i ' m so full <eos>
 i hope you liked it <eos>
 oh it was so good ! <eos>
 i ' m glad to hear that <eos>
 yes <eos>
 oh ? <eos>
 it smells too fishy <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 then i ' ll just eat it <eos>
 i ' ll ? <eos>
 i thought your taste could be different <eos>
 but why ? <eos>
 then enjoy your time <eos>
 bye <eos>
 the tail i should ' ve eaten that <eos>
 that ' s her type of joke <eos>
 she thinks it ' s funny but it ' s not at all <eos>
 joke ? <eos>
 yes don ' t worry about it <eos>
 joke <eos>
 right <eos>
 i have a question <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why is your place so vacant ? <eos>
 i threw everything out <eos>
 a released longterm prisoner doesn ' t need a lot <eos>
 i was out of line <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 remember i said sorry <eos>
 i threw out a lot but there ' s still a lot left <eos>
 what ' s with this go board ? <eos>
 i used to play go <eos>
 go ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 my uncle taught me as a kid for fun <eos>
 i must have seemed to have talent <eos>
 i entered the real world <eos>
 the real world means a world just for go <eos>
 i only had friends in the go contest world <eos>
 i played go for over 10 hours a day <eos>
 that was my teenage life <eos>
 i wanted to be a professional player <eos>
 of course i failed and met you <eos>
 i threw out almost all <eos>
 i had except one thing <eos>
 these are the basics of all the games i played <eos>
 can i see ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i wrote down reasons for each success or failure <eos>
 then my master would write this <eos>
 i started this since i was 11 <eos>
 it reminds me of everything at that time <eos>
 you ' re amazing <eos>
 amazing <eos>
 what ' s this ? <eos>
 the circumstances of the company <eos>
 circumstances ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 it ' s like a diary and <eos>
 each day is a game of go <eos>
 why are there so many pages for this day ? <eos>
 it ' s like a onetomultipleplayers game <eos>
 usually you play against one player <eos>
 sometimes a pro will play <eos>
 against a bunch of amateurs <eos>
 the pro usually wins them all <eos>
 i learned onetomultipleplayer games exist in society <eos>
 the difference is <eos>
 the amateurs have to play against many too <eos>
 i play with you <eos>
 i play with mr oh <eos>
 i play with other depts <eos>
 i also play with competitors <eos>
 one day <eos>
 i ' ll have to play against the company <eos>
 i ' ll show you a trick <eos>
 when you play go <eos>
 when amateurs play with pros <eos>
 they start off with 4 or 8 extra points <eos>
 in reality the pros start off with <eos>
 extra points instead of the amateurs <eos>
 the pros begin with 4 8 or <eos>
 a countless number of points <eos>
 what ' s scarier is that the <eos>
 amateurs ' rules don ? t change <eos>
 amateurs ' rules ? <eos>
 you need to put in extra <eos>
 in my case especially i can ' t beat ? <eos>
 make it maintaining the status quo <eos>
 new employees ? <eos>
 they have to create results although <eos>
 they don ' t have experience <eos>
 how did you come to our company ? <eos>
 i have a sponsor <eos>
 it ' s a small firm called seong won <eos>
 he ' s the president there <eos>
 he ' s acquaintances with mr choi <eos>
 so the executive director pulled some strings <eos>
 that ' s why mr oh ? <eos>
 get out <eos>
 get out man ! <eos>
 you have great connections <eos>
 he probably doesn ' t even remember <eos>
 i never saw him personally after i came <eos>
 why couldn ' t that sponsor <eos>
 help you earlier ? <eos>
 he did <eos>
 i worked for him right after i got my ged <eos>
 why did you quit ? <eos>
 at that time ? <eos>
 at that time i didn ' t hide my past as a go player <eos>
 they were interested in it at first <eos>
 then they became suspicious <eos>
 it led to uncomfortable conviction <eos>
 " he ' s inflexible because he played go " <eos>
 " that go player always goes by the book " <eos>
 i barely worked for a year and served in the army <eos>
 that ' s why you hid your past ? <eos>
 because you might seem like a failure ? <eos>
 you ' re not a failure <eos>
 as a community college graduate it was hard for me to get a job <eos>
 after i passed and came to work <eos>
 it felt like i had simply opened a door not a success <eos>
 i think we keep opening doors our whole <eos>
 lives instead of succeeding or failing <eos>
 then what ' s success ? <eos>
 wouldn ' t it depend on what <eos>
 meaning you give to that moment ? <eos>
 sometimes contracts you couldn ' t <eos>
 seal make you feel fulfilled <eos>
 would that mean a failure ? <eos>
 sometimes you fail in go matches but you feel good <eos>
 would it be something like that ? <eos>
 i ' m not sure but <eos>
 i guess so ? <eos>
 let ' s start anew starting tomorrow <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 i actually have a twitter id <eos>
 i was never really active <eos>
 you want to join too ? <eos>
 follow me <eos>
 i read somewhere not to use sns with bosses <eos>
 bye <eos>
 face ? <eos>
 never mind <eos>
 good night <eos>
 just go back home geu rae <eos>
 see you tomorrow <eos>
 haven ' t you learned anything in our team ? <eos>
 i think it ' s time for me to apply what i ' ve learned <eos>
 i ' ve learned the basics in school <eos>
 as an intern and work training <eos>
 if the basic skills are so important <eos>
 why didn ' t you tell me from the start ? <eos>
 i gave you many chances to see your own mistakes <eos>
 teaching me the basics is just an excuse <eos>
 i think you just don ? t like me <eos>
 just attack them <eos>
 regardless of hierarchy <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 didn ' t you call regarding the budget plan ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 which part ? <eos>
 it was rejected because i lacked the basics <eos>
 you didn ' t add the man months did you ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 how do i add them ? <eos>
 it ' s $8000 for the 4month project <eos>
 categorize it as four midlevel people <eos>
 it ' s usually calculated as $4500 per person <eos>
 calculate it as manpower <eos>
 you forgot the piping map didn ' t you ? <eos>
 piping map ? <eos>
 we made one before but the agency sent a revision <eos>
 we need to reflect that <eos>
 there ' s an attachment which you can ask ms shin about <eos>
 yes so that needs to be reflected in the timetable and budget too ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 use the company ' s format including <eos>
 margins like i told you before <eos>
 let them know the percentage difference from last time <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 yes <eos>
 see you tomorrow <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i don ' t know what is shown <eos>
 but the world is full of those who want to be seen <eos>
 i wonder why people confess about themselves <eos>
 in the game of go the parts are determined by the whole <eos>
 the rules in the world of go are already set <eos>
 if the go board ' s possibilities are infinite <eos>
 if the world ' s possibilities are infinite <eos>
 is it possible to win or lose ? <eos>
 really ? <eos>
 i ' m determined by this whole land <eos>
 people show themselves to be <eos>
 comforted and understood <eos>
 i have to put up with this ? <eos>
 it ' s always crashing <eos>
 dang <eos>
 i can ' t ? work with <eos>
 you anymore like this <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 mr park is good <eos>
 i can ' t believe this <eos>
 keep an eye on your subordinates <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 doesn ' t he work there ? <eos>
 i don ' t know ? <eos>
 let ' s find out what ' s going on we ' ll find out <eos>
 you don ' t know anything man <eos>
 let ' s have a proper dinner <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 please <eos>
 drop it <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 you jerk ? <eos>
 episode 10 <eos>
 hello <eos>
 oh <eos>
 hi <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 you ' re enjoying coffee amongst yourselves ? <eos>
 coffee served by women taste the best <eos>
 right ? <eos>

 i can ' t drink this <eos>
 ms shin i ' d appreciate a cup from you <eos>
 sure <eos>
 thank you <eos>

 yeah <eos>
 useful <eos>
 useful engine <eos>
 come on give me some coffee <eos>

 when will i ride a useful car like this ? <eos>
 i ' ll report him for sexual harassment <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 ms sun <eos>
 mr oh ! <eos>
 oh ! <eos>
 keep an eye on your subordinate <eos>
 a team leader shouldn ' t let mr park act like that <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 the stock market ' s always crashing <eos>
 i can ' t work with you like this anymore <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you ' ve become a part of the team and i <eos>
 wanted us to work hard and be successful <eos>
 but i was hoping for too much <eos>
 what are you talking about ? i ' m not getting it <eos>
 i ' m saying let ' s just work <eos>
 but not as a team <eos>
 suit yourself <eos>
 i ' ll put up with negligence at work <eos>
 verbal abuse to the weak <eos>
 and sexual harassment of women <eos>
 i won ' t let that happen <eos>
 i won ' t let it go <eos>
 sexual harassment ? <eos>
 ms sun came and told you ? <eos>
 the first draft was made for the halal item so geu rae will wrap it up <eos>
 since you ' ve adjusted to the team do your thing now <eos>
 decide on a good item <eos>
 geez <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 then i ' ll continue with my jordan used car item <eos>
 it brings in the profits <eos>
 ok then expand it <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you ' re only looking at used automobiles right ? <eos>
 the future of jordan construction looks bright too <eos>
 expand into heavy equipment <eos>
 expand it ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 first send the materials so we can share them <eos>
 mr kim ! <eos>
 hi is that coffee ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why didn ' t you ask someone instead of coming yourself ? <eos>
 your coffee used to be awesome <eos>
 it was thick and sweet it was like my tonic for the day <eos>
 i heard you ' re going to expand the jordan used car business <eos>
 yes i ' m reviewing the documents <eos>
 it ' s not a bad idea <eos>
 you can bring in bigger profits through products including tires and batteries <eos>
 yes a market is being formed as they sell them to surrounding countries <eos>
 see ? <eos>
 mr park is useful to the company <eos>
 you can get credit thanks to him <eos>
 young yi clean this <eos>
 yes <eos>
 over there too <eos>
 yes <eos>
 also organize the supply box <eos>
 it took a while to find a pen <eos>
 yes <eos>
 young yi coffee <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why do you keep giving me coffee mixes ? i want mine black <eos>
 don ' t you know that by now ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 is that the halal contract ? <eos>
 oh yes <eos>
 what ' s with your expression ? <eos>
 nothing sir <eos>
 it ' s strange isn ' t it ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you want me to tell you what ' s strange ? <eos>
 you can ' t see the selfishness of a big company <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 it ' s ? <eos>
 like that ? here <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 you were so deep in thought ? <eos>
 i told you you should ' ve come to our team <eos>
 you want me to trip mr ha again ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 what ' s your concern mr oh ? <eos>
 you know thinking about the next item <eos>
 i ' m thinking of expanding <eos>
 mr park ' s jordan used car business <eos>
 i saw the proposal once <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 what did you think ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you thought it was weird too <eos>
 yes i knew you would ' ve noticed <eos>
 mr oh excuse me <eos>
 ok <eos>
 that guy ? <eos>
 isn ' t he mr shim at samjung ? <eos>
 you froze when you saw him <eos>
 in the lobby and ran away <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 i caught on <eos>
 why this newbie was so talented <eos>
 i don ' t know what ? <eos>
 please excuse me <eos>
 go ahead <eos>
 why ' d you want to come out so far ? <eos>
 mr park ' s jordan used car business <eos>
 have you seen it ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 i was going to <eos>
 the documents won ' t have any issues <eos>
 since legal and finance have reviewed it <eos>
 if you read it carefully though <eos>
 you ' ll see ? something you can ' t understand <eos>
 what ' s that ? <eos>
 their company ' s profits are set so high <eos>
 that ' s true <eos>
 their size and performance suddenly excelled around the contract period <eos>
 the special profit share among the net profit <eos>
 on the financial statements are too high <eos>
 mr park got that kind of company <eos>
 and their profits are set too high <eos>
 then ? <eos>
 you get it don ? t you ? <eos>
 he gets a back margin ? <eos>
 mr park ? <eos>
 who knows ? <eos>
 so let ' s find out <eos>
 whether our team member is a lazy pig <eos>
 or a troublesome mad dog <eos>
 i shouldn ' t have bought this one <eos>
 i ' m glad i bought you at least <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 what ' s with the atmosphere ? <eos>
 it ' s just so weird <eos>
 excuse me <eos>
 great acting <eos>
 how dare he ? <eos>
 twenty 1bs <eos>
 give me a 3d pipe <eos>
 here you go <eos>
 what ' s with these storage samples ? <eos>
 pipes of different sizes are mixed in <eos>
 i ' ve told you many times <eos>
 how can you find anything when you need something urgently ? <eos>
 i ' ll organize them now <eos>
 leave it i ' ll do it <eos>
 you can go work on the contract ms shin <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i could hear you get told off from outside <eos>
 it seems you ' re using my method <eos>
 acting as a servant <eos>
 did you give up on yours ? <eos>
 hello ms lee <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i decided to stay at my company <eos>
 will you have a sandwich for dinner again ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 let ' s have dinner <eos>
 i ' ll treat you properly <eos>
 since you ' ll be staying ? <eos>
 why don ? t you treat all the newbies ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 i don ' t want to announce i wanted out <eos>
 i ' m regretting telling you big time <eos>
 come here suk yool <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 i can put up with incompetence <eos>
 but i can ' t put up with rude subordinates <eos>
 you didn ' t greet me once today <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 is something wrong ? <eos>
 tell me if something ' s troubling you <eos>
 sir <eos>
 you really don ' t know why i ' m like this ? <eos>
 how should i know your personal affairs ? <eos>
 this isn ' t right you ' re at work now <eos>
 you don ' t take work back home <eos>
 you shouldn ' t bring personal stuff to work either ! <eos>
 i don ? t know what ' s going on <eos>
 but get a grip <eos>
 also organize the polyester item soon <eos>
 mr sung <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i ' ll take a halfday off today <eos>
 i can ' t sit down because of my headache <eos>
 hey did you have a meeting ? <eos>
 you should clean up if you ' re done <eos>
 where ' s young yi ? <eos>
 young yi clean this <eos>
 yes <eos>
 oh right <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 go get my shoes from the repair center <eos>
 also get me liquid digestive medication on the way back <eos>
 shoes and digestive medication <eos>
 yeah <eos>

 you know what i smoke right ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' ll be right back <eos>
 ok <eos>
 mr yoo what are you doing ? <eos>
 she said she ' d run my errands not clean up after you <eos>
 i just ? <eos>
 don ' t you think it was too much ? <eos>
 we just ? wanted to help you <eos>
 dang <eos>
 hey <eos>
 i ' m suspicious of his intentions regarding young yi <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 intentions ? <eos>
 he really ? <eos>
 i think he thinks of her as a personal maid <eos>
 we ' re trying to train her officially <eos>
 he just slaves her around personally <eos>
 that ' s not right <eos>
 he shouldn ? t do that <eos>
 sir <eos>
 why that ? <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 go to pyeongtaek now <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 make sure the fertilizer in the seobu chemicals storage room is sent <eos>
 to the container yard in incheon port by tomorrow morning <eos>
 that is set to take off in five days <eos>
 just do what i say <eos>
 we should move them when there ' s time <eos>
 it ' s the container yard free demurrage period so take care of it <eos>
 shall i call seobu ? <eos>
 i already told them we ' d go anytime this week <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 you don ' t have to come back to the office after that ' s over <eos>
 where are you going ? <eos>
 oh <eos>
 it ' s the completed report for the tf item <eos>
 decided to stay ? <eos>
 mr kang is a good guy <eos>
 do a good job <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 sure <eos>
 you told me to give you what i have <eos>
 why is there no comment on that ? <eos>
 do you want to do it or not ? <eos>
 i ' m a meticulous guy <eos>
 i created everything why read between the lines ? <eos>
 you should make progress when you should <eos>
 that ' s why your team only does little jobs <eos>
 come out now <eos>
 hey <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 what are you talking about ? <eos>
 you guys are trying to ruin mine aren ' t you ? <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 tell me <eos>
 you ' re just sang sik ' s boot licker <eos>
 would you die if he asked you to ? <eos>
 don ' t trust him too much <eos>
 he ended up killing a female employee who liked him <eos>
 he keeps hypnotizing himself that it wasn ' t his fault <eos>
 when everyone knows about it <eos>
 how could you say that ? <eos>
 look at you talk <eos>
 look at your real side <eos>
 now you ' re taking his side ? <eos>
 you want to use his connections ? <eos>
 get on the side that will help you <eos>
 you should get with either the president <eos>
 or the executive director <eos>
 that fool mr oh is nothing <eos>
 he ' s just useless <eos>
 you know what i ' m saying ? <eos>
 you don ' t know anything dude <eos>
 if you understood go tell him to hurry with it <eos>
 i ' m on my way to pyeongtaek for work <eos>
 let ' s have dinner next time <eos>
 i feel like i can breathe now <eos>
 why are you coming along ? <eos>
 i like being at sites <eos>
 close it or dust will come in <eos>
 yes <eos>
 strike ? <eos>
 why didn ' t you call before coming ? <eos>
 we called right ? <eos>
 yes no one answered <eos>
 there was no time so we just came <eos>
 i ' m sorry the office must have been vacant <eos>
 we ' re so busy too <eos>
 what should we do ? <eos>
 hold on please <eos>
 please leave a message ? <eos>
 resource team how may i help you ? <eos>
 mr yoo this is young yi and i ' m here at seobu <eos>
 i couldn ? t reach mr ha ? <eos>
 mr ha ? <eos>
 he ' s in a meeting he probably can ' t talk why ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 strike ? <eos>
 yes apparently the freight strike started today <eos>
 mr ha told me to get it done by tomorrow what should i do ? <eos>
 what can you do ? it ' s a strike <eos>
 just come back <eos>
 if you were a guy we ' d ask you to rent a truck and bring it <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 just come back <eos>
 i ' ll tell mr ha <eos>
 he said just come back ? <eos>
 let ' s go we can eat on the way back <eos>
 i know good restaurants in pyeongtaek <eos>
 you have a small truck in the factory right ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what are you going to do ? <eos>
 you want us to move them ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 us ? <eos>
 400 bags of fertilizer on a 25ton truck <eos>
 we need to make 34 trips <eos>
 34 trips <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' ll see it to the end <eos>
 will it really be ok ? <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 we ' ll return it tomorrow afternoon <eos>
 ok <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 sure <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 take it <eos>
 i can ' t <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i don ? t have a license <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 the exam period ? <eos>
 i missed it as i was busy preparing for jobs <eos>
 for that long ? <eos>
 i thought i was fine <eos>
 come on 40km ? <eos>
 they ' re ditching because you ' re so slow <eos>
 you said you have five days <eos>
 that it ' s not urgent <eos>
 i got the order from mr ha <eos>
 he said to move them by tomorrow morning <eos>
 you ' re so inflexibe i didn ' t think you were like this young yi <eos>
 we don ? t know when the strike will end <eos>
 we don ' t want problems with the shipment <eos>
 will you move it ? everyone ' s going ahead <eos>
 be quiet <eos>
 geez <eos>
 catch on ? <eos>
 no he ' ll think he ' s just an outcast <eos>
 you really think he doesn ' t know we ' re secretly on this ? <eos>
 we can ' t do this for long <eos>
 i think mr oh will make a decision soon <eos>
 why ' d you review it for so long ? <eos>
 how big should i expand it ? <eos>
 make it as big as possible ? <eos>
 isn ' t it weird ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 the subcontractor seems <eos>
 to be taking so much <eos>
 what are you on about when it ' s all over ? <eos>
 you said you were going to expand it <eos>
 they ' re not taking much <eos>
 come on the data tells it all <eos>
 it ' s not a lot considering this business <eos>
 their performance isn ' t great <eos>
 but they became independent from a big firm <eos>
 the infrastructure is solid <eos>
 that ' s the problem with big companies <eos>
 they only look at the files <eos>
 they think it ' s all good if it looks good on the outside <eos>
 big companies miss the details and that ' s a problem <eos>
 i feel uncomfortable about this <eos>
 let ' s just forget it <eos>
 you want to pry into others ' affairs ? <eos>
 move <eos>
 will it end like this ? <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 yes <eos>
 meet with that company <eos>
 record what the person in charge says <eos>
 it should be accurate since there will be an internal audit <eos>
 internal audit ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 go with him <eos>
 yes <eos>
 internal auditing will be involved too ? <eos>
 it ' s a possibility you know <eos>
 can we go to the company without calling ? <eos>
 they could be contacted by mr park <eos>
 this is tough what if the situation gets out of hand ? <eos>
 then mr park won ' t just ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 listen to me carefully <eos>
 we ' re trying to find out the facts now <eos>
 whether it was done by the right procedures <eos>
 even if the contract seems too much <eos>
 it could be just for the people in charge <eos>
 whether it was done by the right procedures is key <eos>
 the procedures might be more important than you think <eos>
 whether he gave damage to the company for his own performance <eos>
 or for personal gain <eos>
 whether the company selection was unfair those are the issues <eos>
 the company will judge the results not us <eos>
 we ' re not trying to ruin someone ' s life <eos>
 all we can do is work on the process <eos>
 the results aren ' t up to us <eos>
 mr park overdid it to try <eos>
 and control the results too <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi <eos>
 how ' s it going ? <eos>
 are you getting along with mr park ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 treat him well <eos>
 don ' t treat him poorly just because he was with us before <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 what ? strike ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 it doesn ' t have to be done by tomorrow right ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 so i told her to come back <eos>
 that ' s ok right ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 so why ' d you send her on an unplanned business trip ? <eos>
 you clearly told her to come back ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i made it clear a female can ' t do anything there <eos>

 dong sik and geu rae are <eos>
 checking with the company <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 you know we ' re going through something that ' s been taken care of ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 then it might not end with one person <eos>
 things could get out of hand <eos>
 it has to do with everyone who approved it <eos>
 i know <eos>
 nothing ' s for sure yet <eos>
 i ' m just telling you the situation <eos>
 if that ' s the situation it ' s usually right <eos>
 individual reasons are just added <eos>
 according to my experience rumors don ' t just end as rumors <eos>
 be careful when you question others ' errors <eos>
 don ' t hate the person or you won ' t be able to focus on the errors <eos>
 disregard the person to look at the errors <eos>
 that way you can question them and get honest answers <eos>
 ok ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 excuse me we ' re from one international ? <eos>
 what brings you here ? <eos>
 don ' t hate the person or you won ' t be able to focus on the errors <eos>
 one international must be very interested in this business <eos>

 it ' s time to react to the trouble the opponent is giving <eos>
 in such crucial times <eos>
 we need to risk our lives too <eos>
 the side who makes a mistake first loses <eos>
 who are they ? <eos>
 it ' s an important time <eos>
 one must not be rash or hasty <eos>

 the results are clear <eos>
 if the opponent doesn ' t die <eos>
 we ' ll die <eos>
 submit all the documents please <eos>
 yes <eos>

 each side ' s documents and account books were compared <eos>
 don ' t you think this company ' s <eos>
 profits are set too high ? <eos>
 here <eos>
 this is a fax that just came from jordan <eos>
 as you can see <eos>
 the jordan company chose ours <eos>
 we can ask for a high profit right ? <eos>
 that ' s true <eos>
 from that perspective the judgment <eos>
 can be up to the persons in charge <eos>
 i understand for now <eos>
 you shouldn ' t treat me like this mr oh <eos>
 what is this ? <eos>
 in front of a client ? <eos>
 there must have been a misunderstanding ? <eos>
 what ' s this move that i want to make though i don ' t have conviction ? <eos>
 it ' s me <eos>

 i ' m the marketing director <eos>
 the documents say you ' re the general manager <eos>
 the documents are correct <eos>
 i got promoted recently <eos>
 please send us an executives ' list including the ceo <eos>
 not the attachments to the documents <eos>
 please don ? t hang up and just send us a fax <eos>
 what ' s wrong ? <eos>
 are we obligated to do that ? <eos>
 i don ? t think we can ? <eos>
 this is the confirmation process before legal procedures <eos>
 according to our reviews <eos>
 icv company consists of locals <eos>
 according to the corporation register too <eos>
 wait a minute please <eos>
 we need to check the jordan company <eos>
 who ' s in the amman office ? <eos>
 call him and tell him to go to the address i sent now <eos>
 ok bye <eos>
 our dispatched worker will go there soon <eos>
 please explain it to them <eos>
 resource ? <eos>
 hello this is sales team 3 ' s jang geu rae <eos>
 is young yi ? <eos>
 she ' s not in <eos>
 can you look into it ? <eos>
 baek ki please <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i ' ll ask the audit team <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 are you a jordan citizen mr park ? <eos>
 no i ' m not <eos>
 then why do you use a local name <eos>
 and you signed the contract too ? <eos>
 can we consider this forgery ? <eos>
 how could you all say this ? <eos>
 how ? <eos>
 yes i set their profits high <eos>
 it ' s my responsibility and mistake <eos>
 i ' ll take responsibility ok ? <eos>
 i ' ll take responsibility by a pay cut or whatever <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 will you leave them out ? <eos>
 a move ? <eos>
 this is so embarrassing ! <eos>
 ? is decided by the previous move <eos>
 businessmen have to save face ! <eos>
 it ' s all because i ' m lacking ! ok ? <eos>
 in order to understand why this move was made <eos>
 you must look at the previous move <eos>
 this could happen during business ? <eos>
 in order to understand why the opponent is resisting <eos>
 you must review the previous moves <eos>
 we always do business ? <eos>
 what might have looked like a small <eos>
 problem might not be at all <eos>
 giveandtake we need to give first ? <eos>
 that ' s what was going on <eos>
 then they ' ll give to us too <eos>
 i ' ll write a statement to explain this <eos>
 then that will solve the problem <eos>
 mr park was revealing it all <eos>
 let ' s go to the company <eos>
 james <eos>
 the man named james at icv company ? <eos>
 ? is mr park <eos>
 james park <eos>
 mr park sang joon in jordan is your cousin ? <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 what happened ? <eos>
 it ' s his son <eos>
 every crack is completed by the internal conditions <eos>
 right ? <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 you jerk <eos>
 he would ' ve thought of it as compensation <eos>
 park jong sik ! <eos>
 in 2008 a $012 mil export contract was sealed <eos>
 steel accomplished the biggest deal by itself <eos>
 mr park was in charge of communication with the locals <eos>
 he solved every single problem and <eos>
 helped the contract to be signed <eos>
 ok ok what is this ? <eos>
 it ' s the general manager ' s company card ! <eos>
 let ' s party tonight ! <eos>
 oh thank you <eos>
 come on <eos>
 you should be enjoying the night <eos>
 what ' s with you ? <eos>
 you should go to the end <eos>
 right <eos>
 go until i die <eos>
 please sir <eos>
 i ' ll treat you to a drink <eos>
 this is no fun <eos>
 they get all the money <eos>
 i just get a salary ? <eos>
 this won ' t work sir <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 you can ' t do this <eos>
 it must have started like that <eos>
 he must have thought " this is how you get compensated " <eos>
 you can send 20% here <eos>
 he would come to ask for returns <eos>
 you should work on a big scale <eos>
 just take over an old local company <eos>
 get some reliable men in there <eos>
 and you ' ll rake in money regularly <eos>
 whatever sales profits come in are yours <eos>
 you should get paid for your sweat <eos>
 don ' t you think ? <eos>
 he must have opened his eyes <eos>
 and started to see the world <eos>
 mr park <eos>
 where ' s the boss ? <eos>
 i don ' t know <eos>
 why act busy like that ? <eos>
 right ? <eos>
 everything must have seemed silly to him <eos>
 this apartment is much cheaper than the market price <eos>
 nice location <eos>
 he must have started to think <eos>
 life was easy and natural <eos>
 then everything became nothing <eos>
 how will it turn out ? <eos>
 i don ' t know <eos>
 from an outsider ' s point of view the good triumphed over the evil <eos>
 company rules work differently though <eos>
 company rules ? <eos>
 let ' s just be satisfied that we did what we could <eos>
 how did you think of finding out mr park ' s english name ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 when i checked the fax there were <eos>
 many parks among the executives ' list <eos>
 when i asked what his business card said it was james park <eos>
 auditing team ? <eos>
 when baek ki asked the audit team about mr park <eos>
 the names of mr park ' s father and this company ' s ceo were similar <eos>
 how did you know he was park sang joon ' s cousin ? <eos>
 mr park only has one older sister <eos>
 his father has only one brother <eos>
 so i assumed it must be his cousin <eos>
 gosh i can ' t believe it <eos>
 i think it ' s his cousin <eos>
 wow <eos>
 make sure no other companies suffer damages <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i ' m tired <eos>
 you clearly told her to come back ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i made it clear a female <eos>
 can ' t do anything there <eos>
 yes <eos>
 where are you ? <eos>
 mr ha <eos>
 are you home ? <eos>
 no i ' m driving now <eos>
 i heard it didn ' t work out <eos>
 how could you just go home when things changed ? <eos>
 i told you to go straight home as ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what are you talking about ? <eos>
 so don ' t worry <eos>
 after i go to incheon port i just need to make two more trips <eos>
 everything can be completed by tomorrow <eos>
 you fool ! <eos>
 you idiot ! <eos>
 are you trying to screw me over ? <eos>
 you crazy witch ! <eos>
 how could you do this to me ? <eos>
 you moron <eos>
 you don ' t have to do it by tomorrow so come back now <eos>
 i ' ll get someone tomorrow so come back now ! <eos>
 mr ha is so mean ? <eos>
 how could he curse at you like that ? <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 you still want to work here ? <eos>
 why must we get treated like this after working so hard ? <eos>
 where is the justice ? <eos>
 we really worked hard <eos>
 are you ok ? <eos>
 you frigging witch do you want to die ? <eos>
 what would you have done if you got into an accident ? <eos>
 you know how bad an industrial accident is to the company ' s image ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 get out of my face ! <eos>
 i ' ll just park ? <eos>
 beat it ! <eos>
 hello <eos>
 what ' s this ? <eos>
 sorry <eos>
 bye <eos>
 the level of responsibility differs upon position <eos>
 the head of the dept and general manager will have it tough <eos>
 especially tougher if you ' re higher up <eos>
 especially tougher ? <eos>
 you ' ll be relegated to a petty position <eos>
 if the police investigations prove the case to be bigger <eos>
 you ' ll have to leave <eos>
 people think we just wear neckties and work like a block in the wall <eos>
 we think our actions won ' t affect society or the company <eos>
 but work is our life <eos>
 it ' s still a game of go <eos>
 eventually <eos>
 that ' s what cho chi kun said <eos>
 succeeding at a game of go <eos>
 doesn ' t affect the world <eos>
 you ' re right <eos>
 it ' s still a game of go <eos>
 regardless of the world <eos>
 it ' s still my whole life <eos>
 what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 so pathetic <eos>
 why is sales team 3 involved with resource team ' s business ? <eos>
 it ' s such a pathetic game of go <eos>
 i found out the reason today <eos>
 it ' s just a game of go after all <eos>
 because it ' s still go <eos>
 my game of go <eos>
 because it ' s my work <eos>
 because it ' s the world given to me <eos>
 don ' t be suspicious just focus <eos>
 you didn ' t come to our team for a different reason right ? <eos>
 giving rewards and punishments is my job <eos>
 mr choi will be in trouble <eos>
 it will get uncomfortable <eos>
 you could become a conman underneath the boss <eos>
 if you play games at work <eos>
 it won ' t be good <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 have you seen geu rae ? <eos>

 i didn ' t do it for that <eos>
 what what ? <eos>
 what is it what is it ? <eos>
 the audit team is here <eos>
 mr oh we ' ll take mr park ' s belongings <eos>
 yes <eos>

 what will happen to mr park ? <eos>
 apparently it ' s the biggest scandal in the company ' s history <eos>
 what will happen to mr kim ? <eos>
 the concerns became reality <eos>
 mr jung of resource 2 team was called as witness <eos>
 mr park ' s bosses at the time <eos>
 mr cho won jin and mr shin jae min were called as well <eos>
 mr kim suk man was audited too <eos>
 and … <eos>
 … mr kim couldn ' t evade responsibility either <eos>
 please forgive me this once sir <eos>
 jong sik <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 that was nothing right ? <eos>
 a trading man could become a conman or gambler at times <eos>
 yes because <eos>
 you have to make things work <eos>
 thanks for my daughter ' s wedding <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 don ' t mention it <eos>
 you came straight from the airport <eos>
 i remember you out of breath <eos>
 i hurried over from a business trip <eos>

 a bit late but you always made it <eos>
 but this time … you ' re late <eos>
 too late <eos>
 i heard mr kim suk man already resigned <eos>
 cho won jin => assigned to fabric chemicals <eos>
 kim boo ryun => aluminum shin jae min => distribution center] <eos>
 this is demotion <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 wow half of mr choi ' s men are sent away <eos>

 sang sik ! <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 ok sure <eos>
 go with the complete item <eos>
 sang sik is creating a business now <eos>
 let ' s encourage him <eos>
 i ' ve been to your kids ' first birthdays <eos>
 get funds and find a big item for the middle east <eos>
 wait <eos>
 take this <eos>
 i bought dried eel for buyers <eos>
 take it <eos>
 it was so unfortunate <eos>
 when you lose in go by a move to prevent a tie <eos>
 you wonder what all the moves were for <eos>
 even if you win in a small battle or war <eos>
 if you end up losing <eos>
 it was all seemed useless <eos>
 if you win by a move to prevent a tie <eos>
 you can see a different world <eos>
 i was grateful to the stones in the war <eos>
 enabling the victory of that move <eos>
 every single move seems precious to me <eos>
 doing your best in every moment makes <eos>
 the victory of that move possible <eos>
 missing a moment … <eos>
 means losing the whole and eventually failure <eos>
 when did you start losing the moment ? <eos>
 mr choi <eos>
 sales team 3 … <eos>
 oh <eos>
 hello <eos>
 oh sir <eos>
 sir <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i got the report <eos>
 your team did a great job <eos>

 thank you <eos>
 what a surprise sir <eos>
 oh mr choi <eos>
 they did a good job <eos>
 i ' ll award those to deserve it and punish those who need it <eos>
 that ' s my job <eos>
 yes <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 i heard you played a big role <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 instead of getting off work as soon as you can look around one last time <eos>
 then you can minimize your mistakes <eos>
 that ' s been my habit since i was new here <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 yes ? <eos>
 you ' ll be promoted next year <eos>
 that ' s nonsense <eos>
 promote mr oh to deputy head of 2 years <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i ' ll do that right away in the first half of next year <eos>
 when ' s the personnel appointment of the latter half of this year ? <eos>
 a week later sir <eos>
 let ' s do it then <eos>
 employees can only be compensated by <eos>
 their salary and timely promotions <eos>
 oh sir <eos>
 hi <eos>
 you ' re in charge of sales until mr kim ' s successor comes ? <eos>
 oh … <eos>
 yes <eos>
 ok <eos>
 bye sir <eos>
 sir <eos>
 bye sir <eos>
 kids dad will be promoted ! <eos>
 really ? <eos>
 really ? <eos>
 really ? <eos>
 really ! <eos>
 hey do you even know what promotion is ? <eos>
 nope ! <eos>
 he ' ll become deputy head <eos>
 be quiet ! <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 you even know what that is ? <eos>
 nope ! <eos>
 then why get excited ? <eos>
 you feel great ! <eos>
 yeah ! <eos>
 so we feel great too ! <eos>
 freeze ! <eos>
 sit down ! <eos>
 yeah ! <eos>
 oh yeah this … <eos>
 it ' s our team ' s special bonus <eos>
 special bonus ? <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 okay <eos>
 there was that much to spend ? <eos>
 since the kids are growing there are things to do <eos>
 give me your wallet <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 use it wisely <eos>
 i can use my credit card <eos>
 you ' ll have to pay for others ' cab fare <eos>
 it doesn ' t look good when a guy has no money <eos>
 thin wallets are popular now <eos>
 no one carries cash with them <eos>
 ok then give it back <eos>
 no <eos>
 i don ' t go with the trends <eos>
 let ' s see how much there is wow ! <eos>
 shall we order pizza ? <eos>
 yeah ! <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 did you complete the registration ? <eos>
 yes i did <eos>
 if you didn ' t you won ' t get compensated for accidents <eos>
 got it ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 let ' s go mr deputy head <eos>
 after i finish reading this report from the research center <eos>
 manager oh … <eos>
 i mean deputy head oh seems <eos>
 easygoing but meticulous as always <eos>
 our team was calm <eos>
 no one mentioned mr park ' s incident <eos>
 everyone was silent <eos>
 it was probably because our team ' s <eos>
 accomplishments brought unfortunate results <eos>
 so i think they ' re escaping to work <eos>
 deputy head oh is especially quiet <eos>
 so all he can do is work <eos>
 mr oh and the rest of our team can ' t feel the change <eos>
 but you can feel how they see us <eos>
 differently in the hallway <eos>
 we didn ' t just scold <eos>
 a negligent team member <eos>
 we removed an infection of the company <eos>
 but our team members were <eos>
 viewed as whistleblowers <eos>
 ' why couldn ' t you take care of it internally ? ' <eos>
 ' why pursue profit betraying your colleague ? ' <eos>
 ' are you all innocent ? ' <eos>
 you can see online comments pitying <eos>
 transferrees and mr kim who resigned <eos>
 no one denied the fact <eos>
 that they should take responsibility <eos>
 mr oh called us to talk in private <eos>
 oh <eos>
 it will get more uncomfortable <eos>
 don’t get stirred up <eos>
 the important thing is you did what you needed to <eos>
 don ' t ever miss that <eos>
 mr oh created a guide for us <eos>
 we agreed to it <eos>
 we just have to hang in there <eos>
 hey mr ha <eos>
 i heard young yi was trying to move the whole load herself that day <eos>
 how did you know ? <eos>
 suk yool is telling everyone now <eos>
 badmouthing you … <eos>
 geez <eos>
 i told you young yi is scary <eos>
 i actually feel proud of … <eos>
 you ' re good at russian <eos>
 you take charge of the certification issue in russia <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 i ' ve never met anyone as tenacious as you <eos>
 if i leave you alone you ' ll disgrace <eos>
 our team creating accidents everywhere <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 i won ' t let you off easily just because you ' re a girl <eos>
 i ' ll work hard <eos>
 why are you looking at the t/f report <eos>
 that was already approved by finance ? <eos>
 is something wrong ? <eos>
 it ' s a bit long <eos>
 it needs to be more concise <eos>
 long ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 in what way ? <eos>
 there are many nonprofessional terms <eos>
 above all if you thought you ' d <eos>
 lead it you would ' ve taken full charge <eos>
 that way you could lead the sentences <eos>
 otherwise they become long and clunky <eos>
 i get it sir <eos>
 you don ' t get it do you ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 summarize it <eos>
 what does he mean long ? <eos>
 i think they ' re the same <eos>
 where are the nonprofessional terms ? <eos>
 i ' ve been trained that much <eos>
 the special notice about the middle east course <eos>
 notice <eos>
 about <eos>
 middle east <eos>
 course <eos>
 it ' s long <eos>
 notice about … <eos>
 notice about … <eos>
 special … <eos>
 about the … <eos>
 issue ? <eos>

 middle east courserelated issues <eos>
 one of the biggest islam holidays <eos>

 i don ' t know if anyone will want to come <eos>
 ms sun <eos>
 yeah <eos>

 what is it ? <eos>
 i <eos>

 don ' t you need a certification to export it to the states ? <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 what certification ? <eos>

 you don ' t understand do you ? <eos>
 go look it up ! <eos>

 you mean between korea and the us ? <eos>
 what kind of certification ? <eos>
 i ' m not talking about the free trade agreement <eos>
 how did such a dense guy join one international ? <eos>
 which college did you go to ? <eos>
 that ' s why they should review colleges too <eos>
 you ' re in ms sun ' s team right ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 that ' s why a woman shouldn ' t become a team leader ! <eos>
 go find her ! <eos>
 i don ' t understand what he wants <eos>
 give me the documents <eos>
 i ' ll talk to him <eos>
 is certification necessary for exporting fermented bean paste ? <eos>
 or are you talking about fta conditions ? <eos>
 you know conditions or certification or whatever <eos>
 what is the " whatever " you ' re talking about ? <eos>
 we need to get food certification <eos>
 to export organisms ! <eos>
 organisms ? <eos>
 is fermented bean paste octopus or squid ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i ' m sure you know since you ' ve reviewed it <eos>
 it ' s a complete product that went through <eos>
 the manufacturing process ingredient analysis fertilizer checkup <eos>
 antioxidant use and colon bacillus checkup <eos>
 it went through factory and sample checkup <eos>
 what certification is necessary and conditions need to be fulfilled ? <eos>
 if you remember what that <eos>
 " whatever " is let me know <eos>
 we ' ll go ahead with the schedule <eos>
 hey <eos>
 i kept letting you go since you ' re a woman <eos>
 you ! <eos>
 you should thank your husband <eos>
 for putting up with a woman like you <eos>
 two sexual harassment <eos>
 won ' t end with a pay cut <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what did you just say ? <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 why that … <eos>
 mr ma will tell you if he needs anything <eos>
 so just proceed as scheduled <eos>
 i ' ll take care of mr ma ' s approvals from now on <eos>
 so i ' ll take over anything he asks you to do <eos>
 yes <eos>
 when you spoke with mr oh <eos>
 did he mention who would go to team 3 ? <eos>
 i heard an assistant manager might go <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 i don ' t want to go to that team <eos>
 i want to work under you for a long time <eos>
 i can ' t send you <eos>
 ms sun <eos>
 the person to go has been decided <eos>
 good news <eos>
 mr chun is coming <eos>
 what ' s he like ? <eos>
 don ' t worry he ' s normal <eos>
 he ' s experienced with the middle east although not as much as mr park <eos>
 he used to work for sales team 3 <eos>
 it was his first dept as an experienced employee <eos>
 i … <eos>
 became exhausted by a bad boss <eos>
 so we relied on each other <eos>
 we worked hard under mr oh <eos>
 lots of good memories <eos>
 how are experienced positions and open recruitment different ? <eos>
 first of all they don’t have someone like you <eos>
 someone they entered the company with and can talk to <eos>
 weak support base too <eos>
 he wanted to come in this atmosphere <eos>
 maybe he missed old colleagues <eos>
 you have a big belly <eos>
 mr chun ! <eos>
 you ' re already here <eos>
 dong sik <eos>
 i mean mr kim <eos>
 how are you ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 hi mr chun ! <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 i came to say hello in advance i look forward to working with you <eos>
 why are you so tense ? come on <eos>
 you ' re acting weird <eos>
 he ' s a newbie in our team <eos>
 hi <eos>
 i ' m jang geu rae <eos>
 nice to meet you <eos>
 you came to say hi and organized your desk ? <eos>
 boxes … <eos>
 you want to sit here ? <eos>
 then i ' ll go say bye to my previous team <eos>
 mr chun gwan woong age 37 <eos>
 that ' s my desk <eos>
 he organized his desk as soon as he came <eos>
 all the items were in place as if they belonged there <eos>
 i thought the man taking mr park ' s <eos>
 place would make things relatively easy <eos>
 instead he created a tense atmosphere <eos>
 dong sik <eos>
 yes <eos>
 go to the life supplies team <eos>
 for some samples with geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 sir <eos>
 what about the polyester case ? <eos>
 why should i do that ? <eos>
 wasn’t a halfday off enough why are you still upset ? <eos>
 didn’t i tell you that ' s your job ? <eos>
 come here suk yool <eos>
 is that right ? <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 instead of a banker ' s usance you wrote a shipper ' s usance ! <eos>
 there are specific instances to use these terms in the polyester case ! <eos>
 if you had trained as i asked you to you wouldn’t get this wrong ! <eos>
 i ' m sorry i made a mistake <eos>
 i ' ll fix it <eos>
 fixing it won ' t do <eos>
 listen carefully <eos>
 people learn from mistakes <eos>
 i want you to know how i feel <eos>
 read some self improvement books <eos>
 see what kind of seniors are good <eos>
 don ' t get confused again <eos>
 banker ' s shipper ' s you ' re not going to pay the interest <eos>
 it ' s bigger than a month ' s salary and i don’t have money <eos>
 banker ' s shipper ' s ok ? <eos>
 banker ' s usance is paid by the importer <eos>
 and shipper ' s usance by the exporter <eos>
 suk yool met his match <eos>
 mr sung won ' t be easy to beat <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 how do you memorize trade terms so well ? <eos>
 aog <eos>
 the starting or payment expiration point <eos>
 for a discount is when products arrive <eos>
 no hesitation you ' re like a vending <eos>
 machine and i pressed the vending <eos>
 it ' s easy to memorize if you associate the terms <eos>
 it ' s just like playing go <eos>
 according to you you should <eos>
 understand the core of proposals <eos>
 if you connect the dots you can find <eos>
 out the company ' s size or characteristics <eos>
 but you never get it and ask me again and again <eos>
 you ' re like that <eos>
 do a good job vending machine <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 mr kang asked him to do it too <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 making sentences concise <eos>
 he always trains newbies like that <eos>
 after that the reports <eos>
 become much easier to read <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 why didn ' t you tell me how reports can improve ? <eos>
 don ' t worry i ' ll make you throw up while writing reports <eos>
 are you vladimir michailovich andreyev ? <eos>
 the report you sent is different from our request <eos>
 it ' s meant to set the emission <eos>
 quantity by ton of co2 equivalent <eos>
 the unit used is different <eos>
 from what we had requested <eos>
 did you make a mistake ? <eos>
 yes i ' d appreciate it if you ' d revise it <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 yes <eos>
 go bring my shoes on the way <eos>
 a pack of cigarettes for me <eos>
 you know what i smoke <eos>
 you bought peppermint instead last time <eos>
 how could you ask her to do that ? <eos>
 she has to send the mail <eos>
 can i go after making some copies ? <eos>
 why that … <eos>
 oh young yi <eos>
 geu rae <eos>

 suk yool <eos>
 what are you doing here ? <eos>
 what are you laughing about ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 i ' m not that happy <eos>
 shall we have a drink tonight ? <eos>
 a boss torments you in your face <eos>
 a boss treats me like trash <eos>
 a boss … <eos>
 you know what ' s the worst type of boss ? <eos>
 bosses that use juniors <eos>
 bosses that slave juniors around <eos>
 give you their work and take the credit <eos>
 but you know what ' s worse ? <eos>
 he … doesn’t know what he ' s doing <eos>
 i mean he ' s feigning ignorance <eos>
 i think he ' s feigning ignorance <eos>
 but everyone falls for him <eos>
 how does he do it ? <eos>
 is everyone pure ? <eos>
 especially mr moon <eos>
 is he blind or deaf ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 answer your phone <eos>

 hello ? <eos>
 suk yool <eos>

 yes <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 your fly <eos>
 you can ' t fool me again <eos>
 it ' s true this time <eos>
 thanks for bowing <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 why that … <eos>
 i ' m a guy <eos>
 so i try to be understanding like <eos>
 a guy when you ask me to do stuff <eos>
 newbies should do everyone ' s work <eos>
 it ' s all your work suk yool <eos>
 so i ' ll do what you ask me to <eos>
 so it ' s all your work <eos>
 not mine but yours <eos>
 so you ' re making me <eos>
 do stuff to train me <eos>
 i understand that <eos>
 so i ' m telling you now <eos>
 it ' s not my work but yours ! <eos>
 your work <eos>
 you ' re a total sociopath aren ' t you ? <eos>
 repeating the same thing over and over again … <eos>
 sociopath ? <eos>
 i ' m a sociopath ? <eos>
 so i … <eos>
 i wanted to be mentored by you and learn <eos>
 properly like the other newbies <eos>
 so suk yool that ' s why it ' s all your work <eos>
 not mine but yours <eos>
 i ' m not saying i won ' t do it <eos>
 i will but … <eos>
 but you can ' t take <eos>
 credit for what i did <eos>
 i think you should be considerate about that <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 yes <eos>
 you ' re a real sociopath <eos>
 please listen to me sung ! <eos>
 did you just call me by name " sung " ? <eos>
 no … <eos>
 why this … <eos>
 you ' re not a sociopath but a psychopath <eos>
 psychopath ? <eos>

 i don’t feel like drinking anymore <eos>

 fall and winter will pass by soon <eos>

 " our kid … " <eos>
 last spring i wanted to hear that word <eos>
 it ' ll be spring and already a year <eos>

 i know what you ' re doing <eos>
 you want to check out our team right ? <eos>
 come on i know mr oh ' s style why should i ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' ll be right back <eos>
 are you kidding me ? <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 you think work is a joke ? <eos>
 am i your friend ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 you should be tense around a new person <eos>
 yes <eos>
 leave our tough but fun memories of three years ago behind <eos>
 don ' t take them with you forever it ' s pathetic <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 uh mr chun <eos>
 you didn ' t come to our team <eos>
 for other reasons did you ? <eos>
 not me at least <eos>
 though i don ' t know what the sender was thinking <eos>
 i ' m sure no one ' s criticizing your team <eos>
 but you should know they ' re watching <eos>
 they ' re staring <eos>
 if you suspect me it won ' t be good so perish the thought <eos>
 you guys didn’t do anything wrong you did well <eos>
 but having people like that around is suffocating <eos>
 nothing ' s happened yet but if <eos>
 they need me they ' ll call me out <eos>
 anyway get used to the circumstances <eos>
 why … <eos>
 … did they send you ? <eos>
 i ' m going nuts <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 it ' s because we ' re close <eos>
 if they send someone who ' s not close <eos>
 who knows what your filtering will do ? <eos>
 let ' s make it work out <eos>
 hello sir <eos>
 oh hi <eos>
 let ' s look at the work progress mr kim <eos>
 yes i ' ll send it right away <eos>
 who was in charge of this ? <eos>
 our team sir <eos>
 this is the jordan case the one where mr park got in trouble <eos>
 oh there are reasons … <eos>
 let ' s see the documents again in the afternoon <eos>
 this won ' t do <eos>
 oh … <eos>
 sir <eos>
 mr chun ! <eos>
 yes ? <eos>
 you ' re funny <eos>
 work since you ' re at work <eos>
 don ' t influence others that way <eos>
 you know why people get addicted to games ? <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 it ' s because they play games <eos>
 if you play games at work … <eos>
 … you ' ll get addicted to games first <eos>
 let ' s go for a drink after work <eos>
 what is this ? <eos>
 yesterday ' s receipt for the drinks <eos>
 why you … <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 i want to say something to you <eos>
 i was going to tell you but i <eos>
 didn ' t want to hurt your feelings <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 you have to change your personality for social life <eos>
 i won ' t repeat myself so listen carefully <eos>
 yesterday … <eos>
 … you seemed like a sociopath <eos>
 fix it <eos>
 sociopath … <eos>
 above all if you thought you ' d <eos>
 lead it you would ' ve taken full charge <eos>
 that way you could lead the sentences <eos>
 lead the sentences <eos>
 lead the sentences <eos>
 too long make it short <eos>
 course … <eos>
 make this sentence connect with this … <eos>
 like that … <eos>
 it ' s ready <eos>
 so you can dip it into the cheese <eos>
 here ' s the liquor <eos>
 it was just the two drab guys and <eos>
 now there are pretty boys with you <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 enjoy <eos>
 do you still drink alone after work mr chun ? <eos>
 sometimes <eos>
 he was famous for drinking so much and drinking more at home <eos>
 even if you love drinking if you keep drinking for other people <eos>
 you ' ll want to drink on your own too <eos>
 right <eos>
 since you like drinking everyone <eos>
 wants you to come and you go with the flow <eos>
 you start to miss drinking alone in your underwear <eos>
 right drinking beer in your underwear and watching baseball is the best <eos>
 my hopes aren ' t even that high <eos>
 i just want to get off work on time <eos>
 order fried chicken for the kids <eos>
 and just drink beer with them <eos>
 let ' s toast <eos>
 welcome mr chun <eos>
 yes <eos>
 let ' s enjoy our work <eos>
 like the good old days <eos>
 like the good old days ! <eos>
 yes <eos>
 like the good old days <eos>
 i ' m sorry for having various <eos>
 thoughts before joining the team <eos>
 i ' ll work hard as a team member <eos>
 drink up <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 any questions or requests for me ? <eos>
 just ask me <eos>
 do i have to cut my hair ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 cut it <eos>
 if he doesn ' t reply it means cut it <eos>
 he told me to straighten my hair before <eos>
 cut it <eos>
 you straighten yours <eos>
 yeah man <eos>
 you ' re joking right ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 we should think of visual images too <eos>
 i ' ll start combing my hair too <eos>
 for our team ' s visual image ! <eos>
 cheers ! <eos>
 hey <eos>
 hi <eos>
 i just came <eos>
 are you going straight to bed ? <eos>
 what ' s with you ? <eos>
 you always drank when you came home <eos>
 i drank today <eos>
 you must like your new team <eos>
 you were worried about the personnel appointment <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 we ' ll have to prepare next year ' s business proposal <eos>
 yeah you guys have time this morning ? <eos>
 let ' s have a meeting <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i didn ' t know geu rae would take part <eos>
 in next year ' s business proposal meeting <eos>
 we ' ll be having nonstop meetings from today on <eos>
 be ready <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 yes <eos>
 hi <eos>
 hi <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi <eos>
 hello <eos>
 the whole company will create next year ' s business proposal <eos>
 and prepare the budget operation plans <eos>
 performancerelated goals at this time <eos>
 since a single business item is created <eos>
 through many teams ' cooperation <eos>
 you need to hold many meetings and write out numerous documents <eos>
 we look at new items and old proposals <eos>
 but it ' s not a simple job <eos>
 dinner delivery <eos>
 let ' s eat first <eos>
 let ' s eat <eos>
 any update ? <eos>
 i thought about it and i think an <eos>
 investment business will be a good idea <eos>
 sales team 3 has been working late for days <eos>
 i ' m so tired <eos>
 how many days has it been ? <eos>
 my brain stopped functioning <eos>
 you want me to tell you why your game isn ' t improving ? <eos>
 you ' re too hung up on rules and previous examples <eos>
 obviously you should <eos>
 learn and study moves <eos>
 but how can the game survived <eos>
 only through unchanging truths ? <eos>
 then what should i do ? <eos>
 break the formality <eos>
 be radical <eos>
 radical ? <eos>
 if you don’t break the formality <eos>
 you can ' t become a pro <eos>
 what do you think of the jordan business ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 what did you just say ? <eos>
 redoing the jordan business <eos>
 you mean mr park ' s … <eos>
 by the jordan business ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 what are you saying ? <eos>
 i guess you don’t know as a newbie <eos>
 but you shouldn ' t take others ' businesses <eos>
 don’t even bring up jordan <eos>
 for the time being <eos>
 if you exclude the corruption <eos>
 i think it ' s a good business item <eos>
 the meeting froze at a fast pace <eos>
 why do they look so serious ? <eos>
 hello <eos>
 what ' s with geu rae ' s expression ? <eos>
 getting told off big time … <eos>
 why ' d you get told off ? <eos>
 i wasn ' t <eos>
 weren ' t you ? <eos>
 mr kang <eos>
 good <eos>
 hold on <eos>
 big news about geu rae <eos>
 what what ? <eos>
 i asked a hundred times <eos>
 how could geu rae think of that ? <eos>
 he just doesn’t get it <eos>
 doesn ' t he know what the company thinks of sales team 3 ? <eos>
 they think of them as informants <eos>
 no one ' s comfortable <eos>
 he likes adventures <eos>
 adventures ? <eos>
 he seems so at times though i don ' t know why <eos>
 you fell for him ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 young yi you ' re overestimating him … <eos>
 are you jealous ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ' s wrong with him ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i ' m going to criticize everyone <eos>
 got a problem ? <eos>
 i ' ll have a twisted attitude from now on <eos>
 anyway mr oh isn ' t going to approve <eos>
 he shouldn ' t <eos>
 come over <eos>
 our team ' s meeting came to a stop <eos>
 we can assume the anticipated debates and misunderstandings <eos>
 and unexpected damages <eos>
 but no one could easily reject <eos>
 the newbie ' s radical idea <eos>
 even if i ' m merely a newbie <eos>
 they need a just reason to reject my idea <eos>
 that ' s what a team is <eos>
 but this proposal was … <eos>
 … a bit unique <eos>
 do you not want it ? <eos>
 is it just bound to fail ? <eos>
 is it something we shouldn ' t do ? <eos>
 or is it something we can do nevertheless ? <eos>
 it ' s something you shouldn ' t do nevertheless <eos>
 everyone knows there ' s leftover business <eos>
 but no one ' s saying they ' ll do it <eos>
 they don’t want the misunderstanding of getting credit <eos>
 from a different team ' s work <eos>
 yes <eos>
 even teams that have nothing to do with it <eos>
 but your team … <eos>
 that was involved in it wants to do it <eos>
 right <eos>
 are you crazy ? <eos>
 that ' s wrong <eos>
 then you guys do it <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 how did the newbie ' s words influence you ? <eos>
 then should i abandon it ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 you should <eos>
 there are lots to do aside from that <eos>
 can i do it if there aren ' t ? <eos>
 are you playing games with me ? <eos>
 don’t do it you have a weak cause <eos>
 yes it ' s a weak cause <eos>
 if you must do it <eos>
 you need a just reason <eos>
 a higher value than the fact that <eos>
 it will bring in high profits <eos>
 i need a just reason ? <eos>
 yep <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 let me ask you a question <eos>
 are you going for the profits of the jordan case ? <eos>
 is that why you don ' t want to miss it ? <eos>
 that ' s not all <eos>
 though i do think it was a good business <eos>
 then why must you take over this business ? <eos>
 i don ' t think our team ' s work is done there <eos>
 it ' s not done ? <eos>
 i think we were insulted <eos>
 insulted ? <eos>
 our company was insulted by mr park <eos>
 i don ' t know if just reporting him was enough … <eos>
 you don ' t think it was enough ? <eos>
 i think we should wrap it up <eos>
 wrap it up ? <eos>
 we should utilize the company ' s manuals and <eos>
 systems to make the biggest profit <eos>
 we must make the business back to what it was <eos>
 we were insulted ? <eos>
 our company was insulted by mr park ? <eos>
 if we eliminate the corruption … <eos>
 yes it ' s a good business <eos>
 since you ' re a newbie … <eos>
 only a trading company ' s newbie could think of it <eos>
 that ' s a trading man alright <eos>
 ok <eos>
 let ' s do this business <eos>
 let ' s do it <eos>
 why ' d you send me to sales team 3 ? <eos>
 you still don ' t get it ? <eos>
 hey you wanted to do it ! <eos>
 what happened to mr oh ? <eos>
 take it as work <eos>
 i ' m not ready yet <eos>
 aren ' t i betterlooking ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 he ' s like a daredevil <eos>
 it ' s like mr choi ' s cause <eos>
 when were we too scared to do daring things ? <eos>
 episode 12 <eos>
 let ' s go for it <eos>
 there ' s a good market with potential <eos>
 few people will be convinced <eos>
 to be honest they ' ll think we ' re just <eos>
 being greedy for performance results <eos>
 don ' t worry about that just focus on the work <eos>
 mr ma is on a business trip <eos>
 so just make a report ready for him <eos>
 he won ' t allow it <eos>
 just focus on the matter <eos>
 i ' ll persuade him <eos>
 why are you silent ? <eos>
 the company employees will think it ' s bad <eos>
 honestly half of the men under mr choi are gone <eos>
 if you do this they ' ll think you ' re screwing him over <eos>
 aside from the politics just look at the work <eos>
 is it a reasonable business or not ? <eos>
 it ' s reasonable <eos>
 since when were we scared to do <eos>
 things because of politics here ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 this is not right <eos>
 i see <eos>
 i understand why you thought of it <eos>
 but it ' s realistically difficult <eos>
 it could ruin the career we built so far <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i won ' t say anything else since mr oh wants to do it <eos>
 let ' s work hard <eos>
 yes <eos>
 if you think of something like this again <eos>
 i want you to discuss it with me in advance <eos>
 i think i ' m close enough with you for that <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 it ' s alright <eos>
 let ' s work hard <eos>
 yes <eos>
 dong sik <eos>
 we should find korean companies and jordan local buyers first <eos>
 yes <eos>
 the korean ones need to be able to secure used cars consistently <eos>
 i ' ll focus on big used car dealers <eos>
 in incheon gunsan and busan <eos>
 ok <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 classify the korean companies by size ? <eos>
 no no <eos>
 do that with mr chun <eos>
 you don ' t understand financial statements yet <eos>
 you shouldn ' t have him classify things yet <eos>
 let ' s go over the companies that failed the bid last time <eos>
 yes <eos>
 where ' s mr chun ? <eos>
 aside from the politics just look at the work <eos>
 is it a reasonable business or not ? <eos>
 since when were we scared to do things because the politics here ? <eos>
 why are you sending me to sales team 3 ? <eos>
 to work <eos>
 go help them well and <eos>
 help them succeed <eos>
 you know gum disease ? <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>

 young yi <eos>
 payday makes you that happy ? <eos>

 why do you keep saying that ? <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 hello <eos>

 steel team kang hae joon speaking <eos>
 i can ' t believe the psychopath is calling me a sociopath <eos>
 i heard you can ' t choose your seniors but what is this ? <eos>
 it ' s almost half a year since we worked <eos>
 all i did was find out <eos>
 he ' s a psychopath <eos>
 how could my life ? be like this ? <eos>
 you have luck with your seniors <eos>
 should i go back to the site ? <eos>
 hello mr chun <eos>
 i ' m han suk yool in fabric <eos>
 i admire you mr chun <eos>
 you started with experience as a deputy manager of the sales team <eos>
 you showed great teamwork and <eos>
 were sent to life supplies in a single year <eos>
 promoted to manager ? <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 can you give us a room ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i like the vigor of newbies <eos>
 but look around <eos>
 listen to what others call our team <eos>
 he ' s not that nice either <eos>
 what ' s going on with geu rae ? <eos>
 never mind ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 you know what you got ourselves into ? <eos>
 it ' s a common mistake made by newbies <eos>
 you don ' t see the whole picture <eos>
 you just keep going forward ignoring the politics and emotions <eos>
 companies i mean organizations <eos>
 are not that simple <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 make suggestions that you can take on <eos>
 be objective <eos>
 are you capable of supporting this project ? <eos>
 it could seem like you just want to be a follower <eos>
 i ' ll work harder <eos>
 harder ? <eos>
 you think working hard by yourself will do it ? <eos>
 if it ' s that simple who wouldn ? t work hard my friend ? <eos>
 a biggie <eos>
 i admire mr oh <eos>
 he accepted a newbie ' s <eos>
 idea just like that <eos>
 sales team 3 takes on anything that will bring in money <eos>
 anyway they ' ll see the business to the end <eos>
 geu rae always does that <eos>
 you always compliment him you know <eos>
 do you like him ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i ' m disappointed <eos>
 you never compliment us right baek ki ? <eos>
 when did i do that ? <eos>
 you were against baek ki with mr park ' s incident in it <eos>
 you complimented geu rae for staying <eos>
 and baek ki for leaving right ? <eos>
 that time ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 with ms kim in finance you eventually listened to geu rae <eos>
 baek ki told you so many times not to go <eos>
 but you just went <eos>
 right baek ki ? <eos>
 mr ha <eos>
 i told you to just attack him <eos>
 they didn ' t even ask you with geu rae as an example ? <eos>

 so be ready <eos>
 mr shin is in charge there right ? <eos>
 i heard he ' s meticulous <eos>
 yes he ' s excellent <eos>
 he was chosen as the trading man of the year twice at that age <eos>
 yes he ' s amazing <eos>
 he joined samjung as the youngest employee <eos>
 it was shocking when he was promoted as the youngest team leader <eos>
 he has won contracts over $015 bil for 5 consecutive years <eos>
 he ' s the youngest head of an overseas corporate the best in the industry <eos>
 i heard he has a fan club <eos>
 i ' m a member too <eos>
 you ? <eos>
 aren ' t i betterlooking ? <eos>
 she ' s speechless <eos>
 a consortium with the competing team <eos>
 must be stressful for a newbie <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 hello i ' m here for the upcoming case <eos>
 long time no see baek ki <eos>
 hi <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 you shouldn ' t leave like this <eos>
 bye <eos>
 captain jang <eos>

 yes sir <eos>
 but mr oh ? <eos>
 this is surely a good business <eos>
 you don ' t want to waste <eos>
 i ' m glad you thought of doing it again <eos>

 yes <eos>
 where did they go today ? <eos>
 they ' ll be in gunsan <eos>
 goodbye <eos>
 bye <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 it ' s not easy <eos>
 there ' s no supply complex so there are many small companies <eos>
 when we need a bigger size <eos>
 a big company won ' t want to work with a conglomerate <eos>
 not necessarily <eos>
 it ' s actually easier to procure parts <eos>
 so it ' s easier to package <eos>
 let ' s go categorize companies with smuggling violations <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 there were many <eos>
 let ' s do that <eos>
 where are we going next ? <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 i ' ll drive <eos>
 just do a rough draft and hand it over <eos>
 geu rae will finish it <eos>
 you think he ' ll do it properly ? <eos>
 we have to trust him <eos>
 aren ' t you tired ? <eos>
 shall i drive ? <eos>
 no i ' m ok for now <eos>
 we have enough companies now sir <eos>
 yes <eos>
 how ' s jordan ? <eos>
 yes send it to my email <eos>
 you have my card ? <eos>
 that ' s great <eos>
 the costs and companies are accurate right ? <eos>
 it will be a lot of work <eos>
 yes <eos>
 please send the files within this week <eos>
 we need to decide within a few days <eos>
 no time really ? i ' ll call you in seoul <eos>
 bye <eos>
 i ' ll have to do it as soon as i return <eos>
 yes <eos>
 bye <eos>
 we have two hours before checkout <eos>
 shall we get some sleep ? <eos>
 let ' s do that <eos>
 mr chun <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 you don ? t like this business do you ? <eos>
 you don ' t either <eos>
 but i don ' t think it will fail <eos>
 i know how you feel <eos>
 you want to support mr oh <eos>
 so he can do what he wants <eos>
 this company is the best in jordan <eos>
 the financial statements look good <eos>
 good performance <eos>
 their resale performance is good too <eos>
 solid market too <eos>
 you know what it means ? i can get a rough idea <eos>
 except for the financial statements <eos>
 how can you exclude that when it ' s everything captain jang ? <eos>
 scan it for now <eos>
 also review it again from the start <eos>
 if the numbers pop <eos>
 check by category <eos>
 yes <eos>
 the numbers have to pop <eos>
 the amount unit dollar conversion have to be quick <eos>
 geez <eos>
 you can use all the help you can get <eos>
 how can you be teaching him like that now ? <eos>
 i know <eos>
 young yi should ' ve come <eos>
 geez i wonder if seok ho is doing well <eos>
 mr ma is coming the day after tomorrow right ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 will it work ? <eos>
 we ' ll just do our best <eos>
 ha ! <eos>
 you ' re an ambitious boss <eos>
 yeah you won ' t die for not <eos>
 passing a business item <eos>
 the problem is something else <eos>
 with the concretelike teamwork of your team <eos>
 you could get cracks <eos>
 why aren ' t you saying anything ? <eos>
 i ' m a daredevil who only looks for risky business <eos>
 come like the wind ? <eos>
 what ' s with that bark ? <eos>
 time for my medication <eos>
 see you <eos>
 the numbers have to pop <eos>
 the amount unit <eos>
 dollar conversion have to be quick <eos>
 it should visually pop first <eos>
 next are the numbers <eos>
 get yourself familiar with the form <eos>
 and continue researching the faults and flaws of that form <eos>
 just like the game of go <eos>
 i ' ll build a structure that is easy to read visually <eos>
 but ? <eos>
 did i succeed in go ? <eos>
 i don ' t know if i can bring the rules <eos>
 of a failed game to succeed in this game <eos>
 can i do that ? <eos>
 hello hi <eos>
 where ' s mr oh ? <eos>
 he ' ll come back soon <eos>
 oh how was it ? <eos>
 good <eos>
 good job <eos>
 i ' m sure you want to go home <eos>
 but i ' ll need a report first <eos>
 sure <eos>
 there are many companies that are ambitious <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 bring it <eos>
 took your medication ? <eos>
 yeah hi <eos>
 geez they ' ll stay up for three nights <eos>
 gosh i hope they ' re not wasting their time <eos>
 geez <eos>
 another meeting <eos>
 we ' re reviewing <eos>
 mr chun and mr kim ' s list first <eos>
 whether the companies are capable of provision <eos>
 whether they have a good financial status <eos>
 coffee ' s here <eos>
 mr chun <eos>
 whether their vision matches ours and if it ' s realistic <eos>
 we ' re reviewing it thoroughly <eos>
 i ' ll go ahead with it <eos>
 captain jang <eos>
 is there anything else besides coffee ? <eos>
 mr jang <eos>
 so i didn ' t introduce him <eos>
 he ' s the team leader captain jang <eos>
 a short break <eos>
 everyone ' s laughing but they have different thoughts <eos>
 the uncomfortable truth in the <eos>
 uncomfortable atmosphere is being revealed <eos>
 in the awkward laughter <eos>
 hey sang sik <eos>
 are you crazy ? <eos>
 are you insane ? <eos>
 this ? <eos>
 yeah about that ? <eos>
 it ' s like someone choked on a piece of steak and died <eos>
 and you were standing right there and you gobble it up <eos>
 must you gobble it up ? <eos>
 it has to be revived even if it ' s not us <eos>
 who are you to judge that ? <eos>
 you ruined others by digging into internal corruption <eos>
 and made teams suspect each other <eos>
 now you want to gobble up this business ? <eos>
 that ? s why i hate you you selfish jerk <eos>
 forget it ! <eos>
 please go through our files first <eos>
 hey <eos>
 do you think mr choi will allow this ? <eos>
 why stop him ? <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 it ' s a good profitable business so why stop him ? <eos>
 you ? re the head of a leading team <eos>
 you should have better judgment <eos>
 mr choi <eos>
 let ' s do it well <eos>
 you ' re lucky sang sik <eos>
 you ' re under the company ' s spotlight as you wished <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 the company will be <eos>
 briefing for your proposal <eos>
 sir ? <eos>
 mr choi and all the executives <eos>
 will be at the presentation <eos>
 it ' s a good chance to be evaluated fairly <eos>
 it ' s not a presentation but simply a business item ? <eos>
 simply a business item ? <eos>
 you really think this is simple ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 now that you started it and things are set you ' re scared ? <eos>
 no way <eos>
 that ' s not you <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you said you were so confident <eos>
 get a detailed presentation ready by this week <eos>
 this is stressful for mr choi too <eos>
 if he says no you ' ll say he ' s being personal <eos>
 but he can ' t say yes when it ' s not possible <eos>
 so it should be a fair evaluation <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 it ' s on a bigger scale so we should expand our size too <eos>
 let ' s get our presentation powerpoint files ready <eos>
 mr oh ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 i know what you want to say there ' s no time it ' s too much <eos>
 above all ? i know what mr choi is thinking <eos>
 but ? <eos>
 so what ? <eos>
 you want to quit now ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 we can ' t do that <eos>
 we ' ve come so far <eos>
 we should try at least <eos>
 mr chun <eos>
 let ' s do it <eos>
 captain jang <eos>
 we don ? t need your opinion <eos>
 you need to summarize everything we ' ve reviewed <eos>
 the info source should be accurate <eos>
 you need to estimate the rough prices from the companies <eos>
 most importantly <eos>
 we need a strategy to persuade all those people <eos>
 it ' ll take a month <eos>
 you take care of the powerpoint sure <eos>
 you ' ll do the first draft and presentation right ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 mr chun <eos>
 get ready and call jordan <eos>
 mr kim in charge of the middle east <eos>
 will be in a video meeting from jordan <eos>
 let ' s start <eos>
 our team was experiencing a new sense of tension <eos>
 a new setup work has begun <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 the flight was delayed ? <eos>
 geez how much longer will it take ? <eos>
 isn ' t the samjung consortium meeting at 5:00 ? <eos>
 yes this is just crazy <eos>
 ok we ' ll take care of the meeting <eos>
 so come straight over after work <eos>
 bye <eos>
 young yi yes <eos>
 mr ha can ' t make it to the meeting <eos>
 he already prepared files on samjung <eos>
 export rights so you can go in right ? <eos>
 i ' m not ? <eos>
 we have no choice <eos>
 think of this as a tee shot <eos>
 and relax just do your best <eos>
 i ' m shin woo hyun nice to meet you <eos>
 i ' m jung hee suk of resource team 2 <eos>
 you know kang hae joon and jang baek ki right ? <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 please sit down <eos>
 this is our new employee ahn young yi <eos>
 mr ha couldn ? t make it due to circumstances <eos>
 hello <eos>
 oh hi <eos>
 ok let ' s start the meeting <eos>
 this consortium is key in expanding <eos>
 the business to resources <eos>
 support will be given in various ways <eos>
 we got added to be involved and from our team ' s point of view <eos>
 i think some contract conditions need to be revised <eos>
 i ' d like to discuss that before we start the meeting <eos>
 it will be ? very sensitive in many ways <eos>
 i ' d like to resolve things smoothly <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 yes <eos>
 it ' s about export rights <eos>
 the share status changed after our team became involved <eos>
 i hope you can reconsider how we only have <eos>
 the rights for the previous shares <eos>
 samjung has an exclusive contract <eos>
 we performed explorations and geological surveys <eos>
 yes samjung performed explorations and geological surveys <eos>
 but our plant and steel teams were <eos>
 involved from early on and took the planning <eos>
 i don ? t think our role was small <eos>
 the export rights were agreed upon during the original contract <eos>
 the agreement regarding export rights you ' re referring to <eos>
 was before our resource team came in <eos>
 please consider that our company is participating in the consortium <eos>
 because of samjung ' s lack of technology <eos>
 we would like to secure the <eos>
 southeast asia and domestic markets <eos>
 fine <eos>
 i ' ll consider that <eos>
 i ' ll tell you our steel team ' s opinion <eos>
 we ' ll approach this business in two ways <eos>
 one is procuring necessary steel parts <eos>
 when establishing coal mining plants <eos>
 next is after development ? <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 the next meeting will be at samjung <eos>
 i ' ll see you next time <eos>

 7548531 ? <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 now i know what ' s worst about company life <eos>
 having to see someone you hate every day <eos>
 there are too many faults and lies <eos>
 he makes me so frigging mad ! <eos>
 but the fact that bosses like those guys better <eos>
 and the fact that he takes <eos>
 credit for everything i do <eos>
 you want to fight ? <eos>
 how can a newbie fight ? <eos>
 shouldn ? t you wait for now ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you should start with waiting for fights <eos>
 if the opponent is strong <eos>
 " strong " my foot <eos>
 how strong could a deputy manager be ? <eos>
 you don ? t know how to fight <eos>
 you have to hit them first <eos>
 you went for me first too <eos>
 you just have to be ready to quit <eos>
 this is just wrong ! <eos>
 are you feeling ok ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 you can really drink <eos>
 it seems your team keeps working all night <eos>
 yes we barely finished our powerpoint work <eos>
 i guess only the draft and rehearsals are left <eos>
 now it ' s going to get tough <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yes now it ' s going to get tough <eos>
 how about giving some motion ? <eos>
 no the conservative executives won ' t like it <eos>
 sales team 3 here we go <eos>
 mr oh starts his rehearsal on the <eos>
 jordan business ' s outline and direction <eos>
 i will start our business report presentation <eos>
 your voice a tone higher <eos>
 ok <eos>
 we targeted ? <eos>
 the presentation pages mr kim <eos>
 prepared for the rehearsal were <eos>
 revised deleted and put into order <eos>
 we checked expressions and <eos>
 inappropriate breathing watching the screen <eos>
 we made a strategy to persuade everyone <eos>
 wait wait <eos>
 surrounding middle east countries <eos>
 including saudi arabia iraq ? <eos>
 but i can ' t help feeling uneasy <eos>
 ? to the big market <eos>
 what could be the problem ? <eos>
 let ' s continue after eating <eos>
 the value middle east countries <eos>
 including iraq domestic market ? <eos>
 why ' s it so hard ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you said you were so confident <eos>
 am i really confident ? <eos>
 see ? <eos>
 i knew it <eos>
 why aren ' t you eating man ? <eos>
 why are you here mr oh ? <eos>
 you said you had lunch plans <eos>
 you have something on your mind ? <eos>
 you didn ' t look happy <eos>
 i don ' t think we can persuade them with this <eos>
 you think it ' ll work ? <eos>
 you ' re not happy either ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 i ' m not really happy either but i think we ' ll be alright <eos>
 we ' ve prepared thoroughly <eos>
 you must think it ' s not convincing <eos>
 enough in other aspects <eos>
 like stress or pressure <eos>
 other psychological aspects <eos>
 i wonder if that ' s really it <eos>
 what ' s he doing ? <eos>
 he must be really stressed out <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 this is the 15th floor of one international <eos>
 911 ? <eos>
 we need an ambulance ? <eos>
 come on <eos>
 what are you doing ? is the season getting to you ? <eos>
 i ' m getting coffee <eos>
 i have a new cologne want to smell it ? <eos>
 what are you doing ? get a grip <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 last time we were talking about work ? <eos>
 yeah you have something to tell me ? <eos>
 about the presentation ? <eos>
 what about it ? <eos>
 i feel uneasy about it for some reason <eos>
 uneasy ? <eos>
 who wouldn ' t feel so in this situation ? <eos>
 yes but i ' m talking about the content as well <eos>
 what about it ? <eos>
 well ? <eos>
 i think it shows how it could be bad for our business <eos>
 what do you mean ? <eos>
 nothing sir <eos>
 go on <eos>
 he was just thinking out loud <eos>
 go on ! <eos>
 why do you think it shows how it could be bad ? <eos>
 that ' s ? <eos>
 ? because our presentation is even <eos>
 more like a manual than a manual <eos>
 it ' s perfect and that ' s a problem ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 you know ? <eos>
 a presentation starts with the business outline <eos>
 since we ' re following that we can ' t <eos>
 help but sound like we ' re giving excuses <eos>
 so ? <eos>
 so instead of following the normal rules <eos>
 we should be radical ? <eos>
 geu rae that ' s not right <eos>
 be radical ? <eos>
 yes so ? <eos>
 when you look at a map <eos>
 i would say thinking <eos>
 north goes up is a habit <eos>
 wouldn ' t earth actually not <eos>
 have an upside or down ? <eos>
 so ? <eos>
 australia is down here <eos>
 if you go like this ? <eos>
 it can be in the middle <eos>
 you can see australia well <eos>
 if you put it back to normal <eos>
 you can ' t see it well <eos>
 geu rae that ' s ? <eos>
 starting with the outline is a precedent <eos>
 if we focus too much on precedents <eos>
 what ' s important might not shine through <eos>
 yes <eos>
 that might be it <eos>
 i kept feeling uneasy too <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 i don ' t know what he <eos>
 means by being radical <eos>
 but if you ' re thinking of changing the content <eos>
 i ' m against it <eos>
 you know we really don ' t have time to revise it <eos>
 mr oh i agree with mr kim <eos>
 i think we should choose and focus <eos>
 not be radical now <eos>
 i understand what mr oh and geu rae are saying <eos>
 i do <eos>
 but i don ' t think it ' s problematic <eos>
 to bring in a totally new alternative <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 go organize old reports <eos>
 yes <eos>
 you agree you must be convinced to convince others right ? <eos>
 i ' m not convinced to begin with <eos>
 so it sounds like excuses as he said ! <eos>
 the audience will catch on <eos>
 do you remember the folder structure made by geu rae ? <eos>
 we were trying to think within the structure <eos>
 but he didn ' t even think about it <eos>
 he just focused on the goal <eos>
 instead of the team ' s existence <eos>
 cracks or saving face <eos>
 just focus on the goal of making this happen <eos>
 whether we can take this road <eos>
 or not <eos>
 hi mr kim <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 come in <eos>
 make the situation in your head into a powerpoint file <eos>
 i ' ll give the presentation <eos>
 show your picture <eos>
 give it over by tomorrow morning <eos>
 we need time to revise it <eos>
 mr kim i ? <eos>
 write out parts you think <eos>
 will take time by computer <eos>
 this is absurd <eos>
 sir <eos>
 what happened to mr oh ? <eos>
 it ' s not the mr oh sang sik i knew <eos>
 he didn ' t lack judgment like that <eos>
 he hasn ' t changed <eos>
 what about you dong sik ? <eos>
 you have to leave this team to succeed <eos>
 sir you know ? <eos>
 what are you talking about so seriously ? <eos>
 your team must be so busy <eos>
 is the presentation two days later ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i came to get some air and it ' s quiet out here <eos>
 when you ' re sitting at your desk all day <eos>
 you don ' t know when seasons change <eos>
 when you grow older you feel <eos>
 sad about losing the seasons <eos>
 see you later <eos>
 yes <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 hello <eos>
 i finished this ? i saw it <eos>
 you should go to a sauna <eos>
 i ' ll tell mr oh when he comes <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i ' m not so sure <eos>
 you ' re not wrong and <eos>
 mr oh had his concern too <eos>
 i understand the situation too <eos>
 if this doesn ? t work out <eos>
 i think i ' ll be really mad at you geu rae <eos>
 for a long time <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>

 after listening to mr oh ' s final rehearsal i kept quiet <eos>
 i ' ve never seen rules i learned <eos>
 in training shake in reality <eos>
 after seeing the radical change <eos>
 i realized i was a part of the change too <eos>
 and i became suspicious <eos>
 i returned to my trivial self <eos>
 and ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 will that be ok ? <eos>
 sir <eos>
 i ' ve never seen this kind of presentation <eos>
 am i wrong mr oh ? <eos>
 didn ' t you want to make this business happen ? <eos>
 what have i done ? <eos>
 what are you doing geu rae ? <eos>
 praying ? <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 go in <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i don ' t think our team ' s business will work out <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 i think mr oh is overdoing it <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 that ' s too sad <eos>
 how about the jordan business ? what ? <eos>
 i think it ' s a good item if you set aside the corruption <eos>
 how could geu rae think of that ? <eos>
 don ' t they know how the employees view the team ? <eos>
 i think the whole company was insulted <eos>
 ok <eos>
 let ' s do this business <eos>
 geu rae this is not right <eos>
 make suggestions you can take on <eos>
 are you capable of supporting this project ? <eos>
 we set it up and we ' re not doing it <eos>
 don ' t you know ethics or have a conscience ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 there will be a company briefing for your proposal <eos>
 it ' s not convincing <eos>
 i think pt shows how it could be bad for our business <eos>
 what do you mean ? <eos>
 when you look at a map ? <eos>
 i would say thinking north goes up is a habit <eos>
 starting with the outline is a precedent ? <eos>
 but if you ' re thinking of changing the content <eos>
 i ' m against it <eos>
 we only think within the structure but he didn ' t think about the limit <eos>
 this is absurd <eos>
 but if this doesn ? t work out i think <eos>
 i ' ll be really mad at you geu rae <eos>
 what have i done ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 why are you out here ? <eos>
 let ' s go in sir <eos>
 ok <eos>
 good luck <eos>
 let ' s go in <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 everyone will be imagining an <eos>
 obvious report in their minds <eos>
 they ' ll be looking for opposing points <eos>
 or already be prepared <eos>
 we can clearly feel how they <eos>
 think won ' t go as expected <eos>
 is sales team 3 ignorant or courageous ? <eos>
 you ' re such a daredevil <eos>
 mr park ' s case was resolved right ? <eos>
 then shouldn ' t they end it with that ? <eos>
 you were promoted with the ceo ' s <eos>
 encouragement so aren ' t you going too far ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 ok <eos>
 let ' s start <eos>
 the ceo is coming <eos>
 i was curious and i had <eos>
 some time until my next schedule <eos>
 i can join too right ? <eos>
 sure please sit down sir <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 mr oh sorry for interrupting <eos>

 the payment for the russian forest carbon emission case has arrived <eos>
 please check <eos>
 ok <eos>
 so this business is on yes <eos>
 good job <eos>

 for tc use your name <eos>
 supplier <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 order info in the system for confirmed contracts] <eos>
 you take charge of it <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 young yi hi <eos>
 hello <eos>
 young yi about sales team 3 ' s presentation ? <eos>
 there was mr choi and all the executives behind him <eos>
 the mood was just totally solemn like i ' ve never seen <eos>
 it ' s like i peed and came out and it ' s freezing outside <eos>
 it was ? so cold <eos>
 will that be ok ? <eos>
 i ' ve never seen this kind of presentation <eos>
 what have i done ? <eos>
 just watch calmly <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 please look at the screen <eos>
 it ' s regarding the ' 93 indonesia natural resources illegal trade <eos>
 the indonesia branch manager paid <eos>
 trade costs with retention money <eos>
 indonesian currency for a currency <eos>
 margin bringing a big loss to the company <eos>
 declaration of war <eos>
 a battle without guns has begun <eos>
 why bring that up suddenly ? <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 in 2002 the myanmar tungsten export corruption case <eos>
 in 2007 the singapore wine export corruption case <eos>
 in 2011 the russia medical electronics export corruption case have occurred <eos>
 in 2002 the myanmar tungsten export corruption case <eos>
 bribery with the major stockholder me holdings <eos>
 in 2007 the singapore wine export corruption case ? <eos>
 the corruption cases i heard of during job training and mr park ' s incident <eos>
 were dealt with in much more detail <eos>
 with this export corruption case with the double contract <eos>
 the commission was divided among them <eos>
 and as you know recently there was <eos>
 the jordan used car export business commission corruption case <eos>
 there was a commotion as expected <eos>
 they must have been reminded of the sorrow of filling in someone ' s position <eos>
 which became vacant due to that case or those perplexed times <eos>
 " so what about it ? " <eos>
 " what are you trying to say ? " <eos>
 i could read their faces <eos>
 and ? <eos>
 and the company resolved each <eos>
 incident accurately in a prompt manner ? <eos>
 but there ' s no stopping now <eos>
 they ' ve been resolved nicely <eos>
 and they ' ve been erased <eos>
 what are you trying to say ? <eos>
 what is it you want to say ? <eos>
 our company was always like that <eos>
 you ' re so arrogant <eos>
 what are you trying to say ? <eos>
 it ' s over <eos>
 get to the point <eos>
 mr oh ! <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 why are you bringing that up now ? <eos>
 we ' ve chosen to walk the path of not bringing up businesses that had issues <eos>
 do you know ? <eos>
 we ' re going ahead with it <eos>
 what happened to those businesses ? <eos>
 and going on strong <eos>
 what is wrong with him ? <eos>
 this is conviction <eos>
 what are you trying to say ? <eos>
 i wonder how many mental wars you need <eos>
 to fight to build such conviction <eos>
 now these are other companies ' performance results <eos>
 for the businesses we didn ? t even want to think about anymore <eos>
 shinsung earned $300 mil haesun made $270 mil <eos>
 hw group $160 mil and hongjae $130 mil <eos>
 these businesses are still stable <eos>
 after the cases ? <eos>
 please look at the expected profits <eos>
 the expected profits for the businesses were announced <eos>
 27% hw group <eos>
 their approximate values and accurate predictions <eos>
 it ' s nearly identical to the expected profits <eos>
 please look at the stock prices before the business started <eos>
 and those for two years after the business started <eos>
 they ' ve risen along with the success of the business <eos>
 in the game of go when the <eos>
 opponent disregards me or is greedy ? <eos>
 should the incidents be forgotten <eos>
 since there has been punishment ? <eos>
 if you use tricks as if to avoid battles even when it ' s important ? <eos>
 we had only revealed the offenses <eos>
 you need to chase it until the end <eos>
 it ' s totally different from the rehearsal <eos>
 if we ' re not on our toes we could totally ruin everything <eos>
 he ' s taking a huge risk now <eos>
 from now on ? <eos>
 changing the tide a new strategy will be used <eos>
 from now on we ' ll start the presentation <eos>
 for the expanded jordan used car export business <eos>
 from now on ? <eos>
 changing the tide a new strategy will be used <eos>
 from now on we ' ll start the presentation <eos>
 for the expanded jordan used car export business <eos>
 the goal of this business is to secure 40% <eos>
 mr oh came back to the familiar one international presentation manual <eos>
 jordan is a small country <eos>
 you can see they have a tiny domestic market <eos>
 it ' s in the middle east <eos>
 but they lack resources including oil <eos>
 but thanks to a stable political state and <eos>
 their location in the center of the middle east <eos>
 intermediary trade is developed <eos>
 we have about 280000 exportable used cars <eos>
 90000 are going to jordan <eos>
 this is a large amount compared to jordan ' s population <eos>
 because they ' re reexported to iraq saudi arabia <eos>
 syria and spread to the middle east <eos>
 we ' ll connect with the branch manager <eos>
 in amman jordan for current info <eos>
 hello sir and executives <eos>
 jordan has shown a very positive response regarding the business <eos>
 having met a few companies <eos>
 i know they have been extremely positive about it <eos>
 they have stated they want to do business together proactively <eos>
 you can see the lists on page 18 ? <eos>
 as the presentation went on <eos>
 mr kim ' s conviction was <eos>
 conveyed to the executives <eos>
 regarding the contract and i ' m sure it will be a secure business <eos>
 that ' s it for our team ' s jordan used <eos>
 car export business presentation <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 it ' s not bad <eos>
 yes <eos>
 it mustn ' t have been easy to take over the subordinate ' s job <eos>
 who was punished because of you <eos>
 so we tried to focus on the true value of the business <eos>
 it ' s a wellprepared report <eos>
 were you able to handle it all ? <eos>
 yes the jordan team helped greatly <eos>
 i heard the youngest member in your <eos>
 team proposed redoing this item <eos>
 yes the new employee jang geu rae <eos>
 his name is geu rae ? <eos>
 jang geu rae ? <eos>
 i ' m not sure who ? <eos>
 where is he ? <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello <eos>

 you ' re a daredevil <eos>
 geu rae ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why did you think of this proposal ? <eos>

 jordan used car export business <eos>

 i ' ll do it <eos>

 so i told him to get some fresh air <eos>

 tell them <eos>
 there ' s nothing to say <eos>
 see you ' re all arrogant now <eos>
 so you ' re the first to have a meeting with the ceo huh ? <eos>

 congratulations <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 come here <eos>
 aren ' t you being too greedy ? <eos>
 are you jealous of someone struggling from the bottom up <eos>
 when you have great specifications ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 don ' t be that way <eos>
 actually their team ' s incident isn ' t normal <eos>
 they ' re trying to resolve existing issues <eos>
 i think working on it so there are no <eos>
 problems to begin with would be better <eos>
 maybe it ' s some kind of deception <eos>
 right <eos>
 deception <eos>
 we just have to reach it <eos>
 see you ' re all arrogant now <eos>
 so you ' re the first to have a meeting with the ceo huh ? <eos>
 come on <eos>
 you started to be arrogant <eos>
 the moment mr oh accepted your idea <eos>
 ms shin did mr kang go somewhere ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>

 you want to tell me something ? <eos>

 now you get it ? <eos>
 there ' s nothing we can do yet <eos>
 i understand <eos>
 you might not be able to relate geu rae <eos>
 procedures might be much more important than you think <eos>
 since they ' re a kind of promise <eos>
 maybe people trust that promise and prepare plan and execute <eos>
 i hope the people who believe that promise aren ' t made fools of <eos>
 he really doesn ' t get it <eos>
 doesn ' t he know how the employees view the team ? <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 mr cha hates tardiness the most <eos>
 you must be in a good mood <eos>
 a first attack just the thought <eos>
 of it makes me feel great <eos>
 if it ' s right it ' s right and if it ' s wrong it ' s wrong <eos>
 i have a resignation letter in here <eos>
 hi baek ki <eos>
 suk yool <eos>

 take it off and come for it later <eos>
 you should ask your training boss for help <eos>
 can ' t he do this for you ? <eos>
 it ' s too awkward for me <eos>
 awkward ? <eos>
 then i guess you can ' t share your concerns with him <eos>
 you ' re right <eos>
 that ' s cold <eos>
 although the psychopath isn ' t a good senior either <eos>
 did you go to a sauna together ? what ? <eos>
 then it wouldn ' t be awkward <eos>
 don ' t ever go to one before you become close <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 you ' ll die of the awkwardness <eos>
 see imagine you ' re in a tub together <eos>
 you can ' t get out first but your skin bloats just sitting there <eos>
 even when you scrub yourself <eos>
 it ' s weird sitting side by side <eos>
 but it ' s weird ? sitting apart like strangers <eos>
 you can ' t do this or that and you <eos>
 can ' t tell him he has soap suds on him <eos>
 why can ' t you ? <eos>
 then he ' ll think you were staring at his naked body <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 " what ? " <eos>

 you think fixed businesses have no work ? <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 you know our team ' s yearly profits ? <eos>
 how much work the required manpower and related countries ? <eos>
 a lot to do to ensure things to go smoothly after signing the contract <eos>
 does that all seem meaningless to you ? <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 it doesn ? t matter how it looks to others <eos>
 it ' s not flashy but doing necessary work is what ' s important <eos>
 we might not see it ? <eos>
 ? but don ' t think it doesn ' t exist <eos>
 the figures we decide on ? <eos>

 be absorbed <eos>
 you should always be absorbed <eos>
 it all depends on that <eos>
 that ' s the only issue <eos>
 in order not to feel the weight <eos>
 of time that makes you slump over <eos>
 you must always be absorbed <eos>
 but absorbed in what ? <eos>
 either alcohol poetry or virtue <eos>
 that ' s up to you <eos>
 but anyway be absorbed <eos>
 and at times on top of a palace stairway <eos>
 or on the green meadow beside a ditch <eos>
 or in your depressing room you wake up <eos>
 when you ' re not absorbed anymore <eos>
 ask <eos>
 ask the breeze water <eos>
 stars birds or clock <eos>
 ask everything that passes by <eos>
 ask everything that is sorrowful <eos>
 ask everything that runs by <eos>
 ask everything that sings <eos>
 ask everything that talks ask what time it is ? <eos>
 then the breeze water <eos>
 stars birds and clock ? <eos>
 ? will answer you <eos>
 " it ' s time to be absorbed " <eos>

 didn ' t you say you ' d take responsibility ? <eos>
 will you do that to geu rae too ? <eos>

 moments of embarrassment we had <eos>
 high hopes about the jordan case <eos>
 good job <eos>

 the " w " in german should ring <eos>

 i heard your newbie worked hard <eos>
 regarding the mr park and jordan cases <eos>
 yes <eos>
 he must be bright and full of vigor <eos>
 you ' re lucky to get such employees <eos>
 you had an eye for people <eos>
 see you later <eos>
 don ' t be too concerned about the mr park case <eos>
 that was reasonable <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 but <eos>
 couldn ' t you have told <eos>
 me in advance about it ? <eos>
 that ' s not too much to ask for <eos>
 it ' s not too much <eos>
 that would ' ve been nice <eos>
 last year ' s welfare points will expire <eos>
 so use them all <eos>
 your annual leaves too <eos>
 you know volunteering is reflected in your performance right ? <eos>
 i like volunteering <eos>
 but i ' ll only give blood <eos>
 we don ' t count blood donation more than twice <eos>
 you ' ll have education mileages starting this year <eos>
 and you need to take at least 30 hours <eos>
 that will include english trade and data processing <eos>
 you need a minimum 80% attendance rate and test score <eos>
 if you don ' t pass the education fee will be deducted from your salary <eos>
 english ? <eos>
 it ' s ok they have easy classes and <eos>
 don ' t worry since there are many executives <eos>
 lastly you can look at your contracts on annual income <eos>
 your names are on the envelopes <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 the hr team ? <eos>
 what ' s with them ? <eos>
 mr hong have you finished your annual income contract ? <eos>
 don ' t look at it <eos>
 mr ha and mr yoo submit your signed contract today <eos>
 yes yes <eos>
 they set annual incomes and pay raises in january <eos>
 of course that doesn ? t apply to temporary workers <eos>
 it ' s applied the moment <eos>
 the dept head ' s evaluation <eos>
 and the team manager and employee ' s approval are complete <eos>
 i ' m not part of the a/b/c evaluation <eos>
 how much is your incentive ? <eos>
 so tiny not even $10000 <eos>
 you had a great performance <eos>
 yeah but what can i do if the boss ? <eos>

 i ' m sorry <eos>
 where ' s the file i asked you to organize ? <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>

 work like you normally do <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 you saw in the kickoff meeting right ? <eos>
 what we did was a normal performance <eos>
 of course it was tough but snap out of it <eos>
 work as usual <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i just have to work like i normally do right ? <eos>
 as usual <eos>
 i ' ll become a fulltimer like this right ? <eos>
 no you won ' t <eos>
 it ' s what the data is about <eos>
 there are many college graduates who studied abroad <eos>
 they ' re struggling without a job too <eos>
 if you think of the money and effort they put in <eos>
 it might be natural they get in first <eos>
 they want elites so they look at <eos>
 education gpa scores and talents <eos>
 then they add points for special skills to be fair <eos>
 they compare everything <eos>
 the company ' s manual is very strict <eos>
 there won ' t be any room for you <eos>
 mr oh what are you doing ? <eos>
 hi <eos>
 let ' s get off early today <eos>
 early ? <eos>
 i thought it was my infrastructure <eos>
 but it was just borrowed for a while <eos>
 geu rae ? <eos>

 bye <eos>
 we got off early <eos>
 shall we have a drink ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 do you know <eos>
 what i enjoyed most about work ? <eos>
 i don ' t know <eos>
 learning how to drink <eos>
 i could forget <eos>
 loneliness and tough times <eos>
 i could also lick the boots of people i hated ? <eos>
 ? all thanks to alcohol <eos>
 but what i regret the most ? <eos>
 ? is also learning how to drink <eos>
 i don ' t think i was able to enjoy everyday life <eos>
 neither did i enjoy leisure or a break <eos>
 thanks <eos>
 drink slowly sir <eos>
 enjoy alcohol <eos>
 it could become poison <eos>
 cold mind and warm heart <eos>
 if it ' s cold raise it <eos>
 and if it ' s hot lower it <eos>
 have a cold mind and a warm heart <eos>
 alcohol can raise the heat <eos>
 cold mind and warm heart <eos>
 that ' s a familiar phrase for those who play go <eos>
 have a cold mind <eos>
 and a warm heart <eos>
 as of today <eos>
 i ' ll stop drinking <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 thanks to you i enjoy working after a while <eos>
 i ' ve felt my heart beat that i didn ' t feel for a long time <eos>
 don ' t mention it <eos>
 i know you went through a lot because of me <eos>
 i didn ' t even get to apologize <eos>
 because i felt so guilty <eos>
 having lots of work isn ' t suffering <eos>
 i sent you to work <eos>
 help them out and bring success to sales team 3 <eos>
 do you think i should take out <eos>
 this cavity or treat it ? <eos>

 men who work at conglomerates <eos>
 used to be #1 groom material <eos>
 now men and women are both cunning <eos>
 old virtues don ' t work anymore now <eos>
 no they don ' t <eos>
 as male chauvinism decreased sacrificial minds have too <eos>
 now they don ' t want girls to rely on them <eos>
 as more girls started to work <eos>
 they won ' t open their hearts when they think <eos>
 the life won ' t be easy with him <eos>
 how good a person he is <eos>
 doesn ' t matter anymore <eos>
 what do you think geu rae ? <eos>
 about what ? <eos>

 he lacks the basics <eos>

 what ? <eos>
 my mother gave me freedom <eos>
 when i gave up on playing go <eos>
 she yelled at scolding relatives <eos>
 how will they hurt her feelings today ? <eos>
 how i ran away to my first workplace then the army ? <eos>
 how i ' m a 2year contract worker ? <eos>
 holidays can be <eos>
 ruthless time your family can hurt each other <eos>
 i felt bad about leaving <eos>
 my mom alone <eos>
 but i think it ' ll be better i stay away <eos>
 but <eos>
 there ' s nowhere to go <eos>
 how did i live such a pitiful life ? <eos>
 i realized i didn ' t even have a friend to <eos>
 enjoy a cup of coffee a movie nor a riverside walk with <eos>
 where should i put this ? <eos>
 here <eos>
 take this first <eos>
 is there anything i can help with ? <eos>
 you ' re geu rae in sales team 3 right ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why ' d you come on a holiday ? <eos>
 don ' t overwork yourself when you ' re a temp <eos>
 they won ' t make you a fulltimer <eos>
 dang " temp " <eos>
 there ' s <eos>
 nowhere for me to go today <eos>
 i think i was wrong <eos>
 i wasn ' t thinking <eos>
 i shouldn ' t have left my mom alone <eos>
 my geu rae showed promise ever since he played go <eos>
 he ? please <eos>
 don ' t make excuses for me <eos>
 i knew he ' d make it big long ago <eos>
 he always comes late since <eos>
 they need him all the time <eos>
 this higherup came to visit <eos>
 him when he was working late ! <eos>
 so many people would visit him when he played go <eos>
 people would come left and right gosh ! <eos>
 you know how good he looks in suits ? <eos>
 he even looked great <eos>
 in his dad ' s old suit that doesn ' t even fit <eos>
 he looked like he was born <eos>
 to work at a company <eos>
 and is it just a normal company ? <eos>
 it ' s one of the top 5 trading companies ! <eos>
 sisinlaw ok <eos>
 you ' re so proud when he ' s a temp <eos>
 imagine when he ' s a fulltimer <eos>
 hey you think temps are for everyone ? <eos>
 my geu rae suffers so much ? <eos>
 sisinlaw don ' t cry <eos>
 i only smiled as i didn ' t want to <eos>
 discourage him after he failed in go <eos>
 now he ' s smiling at us <eos>
 when he ' s suffering inside ! <eos>
 that ' s how geu rae is like ! <eos>
 ok have a drink <eos>
 let ' s not forget it <eos>
 i ' m my mom ' s pride <eos>
 i ' m not a disappointing son <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 you had an eye for people <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 shall we have a cup of tea ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 i ' m going to get coffee you want a cup ? <eos>
 i ' ll make mine <eos>
 ok <eos>
 you better start the new business <eos>
 yes we ' re working hard <eos>
 is he on it again ? <eos>
 jang geu rae ? <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 it ' s interesting <eos>
 interesting indeed <eos>
 he ' s just focused on work without <eos>
 any concerns or calculations <eos>
 like a daredevil <eos>
 like youknowwho <eos>
 actually he reminds me of you mr oh <eos>
 it ' s fun when you decide on an item and learn the business <eos>
 you remember then ? <eos>
 when we were the first to secure germanium in the east sea <eos>
 we were running about looking for refinery facilities <eos>
 we worked on many cases without insurance <eos>
 after we heard that company couldn ' t go manufacturing <eos>
 they wanted full compensation <eos>
 so a few were fired to take responsibility <eos>
 we got through that too <eos>
 you know mr oh <eos>
 i mean sang sik <eos>
 sometimes <eos>
 i wonder why you <eos>
 grew distant from me <eos>
 we were tight like comrades in war ? <eos>
 the only person fired was lee eun ji <eos>
 who ? <eos>
 the one who died <eos>
 i think she did something wrong <eos>
 now i see why you ' re still like this in sales team 3 <eos>
 you fool <eos>
 you bent over backwards <eos>
 to protect temps then too <eos>
 will you do that this time too with geu rae ? <eos>
 i ' ll drink the tea next time <eos>
 didn ' t you say <eos>
 you ' d take responsibility then ? <eos>
 didn ' t you ? <eos>
 did you say you wouldn ' t take responsibility ? <eos>
 i can ' t remember <eos>
 if lee eun ji can ' t <eos>
 will you take responsibility ? <eos>
 will you take responsibility ? <eos>
 take a deep breath <eos>
 mr choi <eos>
 couldn ' t remember eun ji <eos>
 he ' s just acting like he can ' t <eos>
 no he really can ' t <eos>
 since she ' s not worth remembering <eos>
 that ' s the way he works instinctively <eos>
 he perfectly erased himself from that incident <eos>
 so perfectly that he could fool himself <eos>
 it ' s his instinct not intention <eos>
 that ' s why he ' s a scary man <eos>
 he used to tell eun ji every day <eos>
 what you ' d see in selfhelp books <eos>
 " go to night college " <eos>
 " dream big " <eos>
 " effort will pay off " " work hard and you ' ll see a road " <eos>
 she was smart <eos>
 she ' d be alive if i had known my place <eos>
 she would ' ve worked comfortably <eos>
 met a nice guy <eos>
 got married <eos>
 and lived happily right ? <eos>
 since she ' s a good girl <eos>
 she told me with smile <eos>
 " thank you mr oh <eos>
 i just have to continue working like this right ? " <eos>
 geu rae asked me the same thing <eos>
 i ' ll become a fulltimer like this right ? <eos>
 i said he can ' t make it <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 times are tougher than eun ji ' s <eos>
 empty hope <eos>
 and irresponsible consolation are useless <eos>
 it ' s scarier we live in a world where irresponsible <eos>
 consolation and empty hope can ' t be given <eos>
 since there are so many who are <eos>
 desperate for that empty hope at least <eos>
 still <eos>
 he won ' t make it <eos>
 i can ' t even drink water in front of you <eos>
 do it over <eos>
 mr oh ' s treating geu rae differently this year <eos>
 one of us were sacrificed for him <eos>
 what a tough life <eos>
 if you have time to think about others work on your weak points <eos>
 if i get a step closer i ' m two steps further the next day <eos>
 geu rae $100 ? probably ? <eos>
 tell him to take baek ki <eos>
 you said you ' d sell anything <eos>
 i told him he can ' t make it <eos>
 empty hope <eos>
 and irresponsible consolation are useless <eos>
 there are so many who are <eos>
 desperate for that empty hope at least <eos>
 still ? he can ' t make it <eos>
 a road with a dead end <eos>
 it ' s not that <eos>
 i just want to continue working <eos>
 with everyone i ' ve worked with <eos>
 us <eos>
 together <eos>
 always <eos>
 there ' s still a whole year left <eos>
 that we can walk together <eos>
 hello ! <eos>
 hello ! <eos>
 you scared me <eos>
 what ' s with you ? <eos>
 i ' ll start working ! <eos>
 you look so energized these days geu rae <eos>
 brew some coffee from the 15th floor <eos>
 or you could get them from a caf ? <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 keep your chin up <eos>
 i told you to wait <eos>
 that ' s all we can do <eos>
 i ' ve been there <eos>
 sang hyun if we just wait ? <eos>
 baek ki how are you ? <eos>
 good long time no see <eos>
 let ' s have a drink if you ' re not busy today <eos>
 i ' ll be nearby <eos>
 uh call me later bye <eos>
 if we just wait ? give me the files <eos>
 i ' ll take a look before i go <eos>
 oh here <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 " shall " would be better than " must " here <eos>
 it adds a polite nuance to the sense of obligation <eos>
 but i thought we needed a stronger " must " <eos>
 alright then <eos>
 you have a hard life too <eos>
 if we just wait ? there ' s trouble sir <eos>
 there ' s a hole in the ship <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i don ' t think it ' s that bad <eos>

 thank you bye <eos>
 right around here <eos>
 these are the list of companies <eos>
 we could contact for worst case scenarios ok <eos>
 we can ' t send another ship there ? <eos>
 it ' s impossible due to the product ' s cost <eos>
 what about using a crane ? <eos>
 vietnam ' s sea makes conditions tough <eos>
 so let ' s not think about that <eos>
 what about a tugboat ? <eos>
 you think tugboats just fall from the sky ? <eos>
 everything will sink by the time we send them ! <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 steel is in trouble <eos>
 there ' s a hole in the ship they sent to aquaba <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 hello hi <eos>
 there ' s a hole in the ship ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 there was ship trouble last year with sales how was it taken care of it ? <eos>
 they didn ' t depart long ago so the products were loaded on a different ship <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 gosh this is bad <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 can ' t you fill in the hole ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 are you kidding ? yes <eos>
 you can fill it in <eos>
 why take him so seriously ? <eos>
 no i think it ' s good advice <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 let ' s go come on <eos>
 you could be blamed <eos>
 sir <eos>
 ok <eos>
 what about filling in the hole ? <eos>
 what ? is that possible ? <eos>
 if it ' s just a small crack it ' ll be possible <eos>
 well ? <eos>
 let ' s send divers and check if it ' s a crack <eos>
 we can have welders stand by at nearby ports <eos>
 ok let ' s do it yes <eos>
 call a nearby branch and ask them to get welders <eos>
 yes <eos>
 kang hae joon speaking <eos>

 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>

 the rice wine b/l draft <eos>
 why are you working so hard when you finished everything ? <eos>
 you told us to get the next business item ready <eos>
 i ' m working on one too <eos>
 you ' ll do it alone ? yes <eos>
 you ' ve never done an item alone <eos>
 then maybe i shouldn ' t ? <eos>
 no go ahead <eos>
 yes thank you <eos>
 mr yoo <eos>
 i ' ve uploaded the norway mineral case in the shared folder <eos>
 ok print out a copy for me too <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i ' ll call you back soon <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what can we do ? <eos>
 i couldn ' t dissuade your dad again <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 what do you mean what we should do ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 what does dad ' s business and taking the <eos>
 early rent deposit have to do with me ? <eos>
 mom <eos>
 i ' m barely sane now <eos>
 you know how i ' ve lived for the past <eos>
 halfyear after he borrowed money <eos>
 you told me to live my life <eos>
 the landlord said we can pay monthly <eos>
 i just ask you for the security deposit <eos>
 i can ? mom ! <eos>
 we don ' t have anywhere to go now <eos>
 i don ' t have money <eos>
 i barely paid off the debt <eos>
 i can barely breathe now ! <eos>
 it ' s barely over now ! <eos>
 i can ' t do it <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 did you want something from me ? <eos>
 nope <eos>
 oh ok <eos>
 steel team <eos>
 hello <eos>
 i heard there was trouble are things ok ? <eos>
 yes thanks to geu rae <eos>
 what did he do ? <eos>
 fortunately it ' s a small crack and we can fill it in as he said <eos>
 so we ' re resolving the issue now <eos>
 that ' s not thanks to geu rae but all the workers <eos>
 he just happened to think of an idea <eos>
 so that means he ' s really competent <eos>
 some people know how to resolve issues like him <eos>
 come on that ' s ridiculous <eos>
 see you later see you later sir <eos>
 one international jang baek ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i ' m glad to hear that <eos>
 we will receive a call as soon as the ship is repaired <eos>
 that ' s the status and additional costs thank you <eos>
 mr han said the first filling is complete <eos>
 and the divers are on stand by as you asked for <eos>
 i think if there ' s another crack we can repeat welding with it anchored <eos>
 i ' ll secure an area just in case <eos>
 ok <eos>
 that was so stressful <eos>
 what would we have done without geu rae ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi geu rae <eos>
 mr song asked me to give this to you thanks <eos>
 thanks for before what ? <eos>
 welding <eos>
 i crossed my line <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 keep up the good work <eos>
 pardon ? <eos>
 some people know how to resolve issues like him <eos>
 keep up the good work <eos>
 is this yours ? <eos>
 if you <eos>
 have time to worry about others <eos>
 you should work on your own flaws <eos>
 you shouldn ' t butt in others ' business too much <eos>
 okay <eos>
 thank you for the advice <eos>
 if you <eos>
 have time to worry about others <eos>
 you should work on your own flaws <eos>
 please baek ki <eos>
 alright <eos>
 i ' ll ask auditing for you <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 i don ' t deserve that <eos>
 look ! <eos>
 gone insane now ? <eos>
 oh new item you ' re clearly something else ? <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 you shouldn ' t look at others ' stuff like that <eos>
 i should go to the field <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 here <eos>
 i mean at this company there ' s nothing i can change <eos>
 changing your boss ' s irrationality isn ' t accepted either <eos>
 you need to wait to fight with a stronger opponent ? <eos>
 until when ? <eos>
 i ' m most scared <eos>
 about waiting until i become a jerk like him <eos>
 i ' m sure he wasn ? t like that in the beginning <eos>
 if you ' re not insane why are you smiling by yourself ? <eos>
 there ' s a distance you can ' t do anything about no matter what you do <eos>
 baek ki ? <eos>
 if you get a step closer you ' re <eos>
 two steps further the next day <eos>
 he ' s always like that <eos>
 right <eos>
 what ? that geu rae ? <eos>
 he was a disaster <eos>
 life is so unfair <eos>
 he got in passed tests and fired people <eos>
 he didn ? t like all through connections <eos>
 he got an item through connections too ? <eos>
 that ' s not really true sang hyun <eos>
 my gosh ? <eos>
 slow down <eos>
 people like me is disadvantaged because of ditchers like him ! <eos>
 why do you think i failed ? <eos>
 ok let ' s say it might not have been me <eos>
 still <eos>
 one of us were sacrificed for his spot <eos>
 he did a good job with the presentation <eos>
 yeah right <eos>
 stammering and selling those absurd dirty slippers ? <eos>
 gosh he made it with that <eos>
 it all proves how strong his connections are <eos>
 i can say suk yool is competent but not that jerk <eos>
 you should be honest too <eos>
 you think geu rae is one of us ? <eos>
 i hope you don ' t <eos>
 he ' s not in our league <eos>
 " fair opportunity " my foot <eos>
 how can we share fair opportunities with him ? <eos>
 my mom spent so much on tutors and cram schools ! <eos>
 she worked so hard ! <eos>
 this is reverse discrimination <eos>
 i should ' ve enjoyed my life too <eos>
 i never slept before midnight all throughout school <eos>
 elementary school ? <eos>
 i went to so many cram schools and in college ? ! <eos>
 i studied abroad too <eos>
 but <eos>
 what ' s this ? <eos>
 huh ? <eos>
 how ' s your company ? <eos>
 it ' s just temporary <eos>
 i ' ll go to a conglomerate <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 you know what ? <eos>
 in order to keep our position <eos>
 we need to work for a conglomerate <eos>
 so how ' s geu rae doing now ? <eos>
 this proposal has to be as professional as possible <eos>
 i created a proposal according to the company ' s manual <eos>
 with professional terms suiting <eos>
 the business direction and the reasonable vision <eos>
 well i don ' t know <eos>
 i ' m not sure but it feels different this time <eos>
 mr oh said only my conviction <eos>
 is important in persuading others <eos>
 i have conviction this time <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 you must be confident <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 you worked hard past office hours <eos>
 i ' m sure you did well <eos>
 well <eos>
 i just did my best <eos>
 your best only works in school <eos>
 at work only the results count <eos>
 geu rae has distinct ideas <eos>
 he sure does <eos>
 once in a while <eos>
 what ' s up with him again ? <eos>
 stop putting him up on a pedestal <eos>
 i ' ll see you later <eos>
 i ' ll see you later geu rae yes <eos>
 let ' s see your distinct idea <eos>
 though i don ' t have any expectations <eos>
 as you see the contamination of famous tourist sites is <eos>
 increasing each year <eos>
 and the future of the world ' s automobile business is <eos>
 also heading towards lowemission vehicles <eos>
 we can expect environment conservation <eos>
 acts in popular tourist sites including <eos>
 the eiffel tower in paris grand canyon <eos>
 in the us and australia ' s opera house <eos>
 so the electric car rental and sales business which will <eos>
 lead to growth for the next generation will clearly be lucrative <eos>
 that ' s all for my presentation <eos>
 you ' re not really smart at all <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you said you ' d bring up a business item <eos>
 what ' s with all this ? <eos>
 you don ? t even know these terms <eos>
 why ' d you use english when you ' re not good at it ? <eos>
 what are you trying to sell ? <eos>
 to whom ? <eos>
 i have no idea what you ' re saying <eos>
 but it doesn ' t sound like an amateur <eos>
 talk doesn ' t come first <eos>
 if you <eos>
 have time to worry about others <eos>
 you should work on your own flaws <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 did you give me the printouts ? <eos>
 did you ? <eos>
 young yi ! <eos>
 printouts <eos>
 what printouts ? <eos>
 the norway case ! <eos>
 yes i ' ll request it <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you said you requested it and it came yesterday <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 when did i say that ? <eos>
 what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 oh the norway case sorry <eos>
 gosh look at that mess <eos>
 print it out for him first <eos>
 yes <eos>
 she ' s going out to print it out ? <eos>
 to the copier <eos>
 why ' d she become geu rae all of a sudden ? <eos>
 you wanted printouts right ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 is something wrong ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 it seems something ' s wrong <eos>
 no everything ' s fine <eos>
 geu rae must ' ve really wanted to do well <eos>
 he overdid it didn ' t he ? <eos>
 shall we just end it like that ? <eos>
 shouldn ' t we tell him what ' s wrong ? <eos>
 tell him what ? <eos>
 you ' ve been treating geu rae differently this year <eos>
 how so ? <eos>
 no way <eos>
 he ' s a good employee <eos>
 it ' s a shame <eos>
 it ' ll be hard won ' t it ? <eos>
 him working fulltime ? <eos>
 it ' ll be hard <eos>
 then he ' ll have to start preparing <eos>
 there will be a position for him where <eos>
 he can use what he learned here <eos>
 the landlord said we can pay monthly <eos>
 i just ask you for the security deposit <eos>
 i can ? <eos>
 we don ' t have anywhere to go now <eos>
 no way <eos>
 i won ' t do it this time <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 yes <eos>
 young yi <eos>

 why ' s it taking all day ? <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 sorry i can ' t remember it <eos>
 sorry i can ' t remember it <eos>
 why you guys ? <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 give it to me ! <eos>
 i ' m so sorry <eos>
 dang ! <eos>
 it ' ll be hard won ' t it ? <eos>
 him working fulltime ? <eos>
 it ' ll be hard <eos>
 then he ' ll have to start preparing <eos>
 there will be a position for him where <eos>
 he can use what he learned here <eos>
 all throughout my life ! <eos>
 you know how i ' ve lived because of you dad <eos>
 how ? <eos>
 how could you ask for money again ? <eos>
 what did i do wrong to you ? <eos>
 i said i ' m sorry <eos>
 i ' d be so grateful for the <eos>
 money during these hard times <eos>
 this is really the last time <eos>
 i always wanted a son but have i ever treated you badly ? <eos>
 daughters are children too <eos>
 dad ! <eos>
 come on help me out one last time <eos>
 don ' t ever call me again <eos>
 young yi i was just ? <eos>
 i wonder what ' s wrong with her today <eos>
 it ' s strange <eos>
 maybe something bad has happened <eos>
 why worry about her ? <eos>
 i don ? t want to but ? <eos>
 you can ' t help it since we work together every day <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 what ' s wrong ? <eos>
 nothing sir <eos>
 young yi is something wrong at home ? <eos>
 you ' ve been ? no <eos>
 don ? t worry <eos>
 take care of your personal affairs before you come to work ! <eos>
 don ' t make a mess at work so we don ' t have to work ! <eos>
 come on <eos>
 geez <eos>
 don ' t you think you went too much ? <eos>
 actually we can ' t even care for her <eos>
 she built a thick wall around herself <eos>
 get away i don ' t want to talk about it <eos>
 geez <eos>
 you can ' t climb stairs without a foundation <eos>
 you can ' t ultimately climb stairs with <eos>
 success where there ' s no foundation <eos>
 you end up on the ground again <eos>
 shouldn ' t we tell him what ' s wrong ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes ? <eos>
 it ' s $100 <eos>
 go sell anything out there <eos>
 you want a cool business right ? <eos>
 business ? <eos>
 don ' t be fancy it ' s just selling stuff <eos>
 making a profit after buying it cheap <eos>
 buying good items and selling it to people who need it <eos>
 go find out the basics of selling stuff <eos>
 exclude your family <eos>
 by 7:00pm <eos>
 what a long title <eos>
 how did he do to get rejected ? <eos>
 he deserved it <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 how are you ? <eos>
 i checked the email <eos>
 but the price won ' t work so i ' ll tell mr oh <eos>
 but i think it ' ll be tough <eos>
 i ' ll let you know after checking <eos>
 for environment conservation of popular tourist sites by jang geu rae] <eos>
 bye <eos>
 what ' s with me ? <eos>
 you want to smell my new cologne ? <eos>
 it ' s no fun ok <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 you shouldn ' t look at that <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i just happened to ? <eos>
 it ' s not confidential <eos>
 geu rae just got in trouble for it so it ' s embarrassing <eos>
 but <eos>
 it ' s not that bad <eos>
 why ? ? <eos>
 you tell him since you ' ve read it <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 yeah tell me your opinion <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i think ? <eos>
 ? for rental businesses specific site <eos>
 selection methods should be given <eos>
 automobile inventory handling and <eos>
 depreciation strategies aren ' t either <eos>
 and <eos>
 the part on profits is quite abstract <eos>
 since simulation should be redone <eos>
 this proposal has to be rewritten <eos>
 $100 for geu rae ? <eos>
 probably <eos>
 tell him to take baek ki too <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 why should i ? ? <eos>
 where shall we go ? <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 shouldn ' t we decide what to buy first ? <eos>
 then what should we buy ? <eos>
 how should i know ? <eos>
 anyway let ' s go where we can buy items <eos>
 yes where ? <eos>
 that ' s what we ' re trying to decide <eos>
 you buy anything you want <eos>
 it ' s your homework not mine <eos>
 i ' ll sell anything for you ? <eos>
 come to that caf ? over there <eos>
 hello <eos>

 i wonder how geu rae ' s doing now <eos>
 i hope he learns something <eos>
 as he gets in trouble out there <eos>
 he ' ll learn why his report failed <eos>
 i wonder what he ' ll sell <eos>
 i had a hard time deciding what to sell with this mission too <eos>
 i went to this store and that like crazy <eos>
 $10 it ' s practically free ! <eos>
 so i thought i ' d buy something <eos>
 cheap that everyone will use <eos>
 buying something cheap and selling a lot of them <eos>
 yeah that ' s the trap <eos>
 that ' s cheap <eos>
 you ' d think buying something cheap <eos>
 and selling a lot of them would work <eos>
 that ' s the trap of this mission <eos>
 choose a nice one <eos>
 sir do these socks sell well ? <eos>
 of course they ' re less than halfprice of what you buy at markets <eos>
 and you can see how durable it is <eos>
 look <eos>
 8 pairs of socks or <eos>
 5 underwear for $10 ! <eos>
 sir i ' ll get $100 worth <eos>
 $100 ? yes <eos>
 just socks ? <eos>

 i ' ll sell it <eos>

 geu ? <eos>
 having a memory is wonderful <eos>
 but they say forgetting is truly wonderful <eos>
 what you can forget <eos>
 is no longer a wound <eos>
 i came in <eos>
 as with all games <eos>
 you realize you ' re not ready <eos>
 the moment you start to play <eos>
 strong resolutions and shouts before that <eos>
 are intuition signs of anxiety <eos>
 when you want to run away <eos>
 it means it ' s too late <eos>
 or you ? ve already started playing <eos>
 captain <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 how are you ? <eos>
 good <eos>
 where is he ? <eos>
 go ? <eos>
 why ' d he come here ? <eos>
 does he know anyone here ? <eos>
 go ? <eos>
 i couldn ' t do it right then <eos>
 did you see ? geu rae ' s here <eos>
 really ? really ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 he must got a job somewhere <eos>
 he ' s wearing a suit <eos>
 geu rae ? <eos>
 i never thought he ' d set foot here again <eos>
 but he ' s here ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 i heard you work for a trading company <eos>
 sungwon ' s ceo helped me out <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 he really liked you <eos>
 how ' s work ? <eos>
 good that ' s great <eos>
 but what brings you here ? <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 my boss gave me a mission <eos>
 mission ? <eos>
 yes i have to sell these <eos>
 i was wondering if i could sell them here <eos>
 according to the rule of games <eos>
 everything goes forward <eos>
 they ' re underwear and socks <eos>
 even if hell is at the end <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 you shouldn ' t have come here <eos>
 because <eos>
 everyone here will buy it for you <eos>
 out of sympathy or encouragement <eos>
 then you couldn ' t say you pulled the mission off <eos>
 exclude your family <eos>
 your boss won ' t want <eos>
 you to do this either <eos>
 right <eos>
 geu rae was so good it ' s a shame <eos>
 we thought he ' d be the first to become a pro <eos>
 he ' s much better than pro kim <eos>
 it ' s a shame <eos>
 he started at seven right ? <eos>
 that ' s too late to become a pro <eos>
 but he became a student in a year <eos>
 he beat lee se chang in grade school and <eos>
 he always excelled in competitions especially <eos>
 he was a good student too <eos>
 when he quit high school i saw the <eos>
 teacher come and dissuade our master <eos>
 he could ' ve made it if it weren ' t for his financial situation <eos>
 i heard he even had parttime jobs at dawn too <eos>
 it seemed he came to ask a favor <eos>
 he must not have wanted to come <eos>
 how could you after giving up on go ? <eos>
 it must be hurt it must be hurt <eos>
 sir <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 bye <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 you couldn ' t sell a single pair ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>

 that ' s not important <eos>
 i sold them all mr oh <eos>
 nice <eos>
 selling them is not important <eos>
 why isn ' t it important ? <eos>
 i worked so hard <eos>
 to sell all of them <eos>
 what did you learn ? <eos>
 that underwear and socks should <eos>
 be sold in front of saunas <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 since <eos>
 knowing your market is key ? <eos>
 give me a report <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 get sober ! yes <eos>
 even if you have to stay up all night ! <eos>
 so i see it tomorrow <eos>
 you ' re still here ? <eos>
 i was writing a report <eos>
 i see <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i still <eos>
 don ? t think your time <eos>
 is the same as mine <eos>
 still <eos>
 i ' ll see you tomorrow <eos>
 born for the site ! <eos>
 then you go to the site ! <eos>
 i feel abandoned by the site <eos>
 why would the company invest in someone who will leave ? <eos>
 who sympathize whom ? <eos>
 so ? all sold out <eos>
 life itself is politics not just work <eos>
 don ? t you want to get promoted ? <eos>
 work is war ? <eos>
 outside is hell <eos>
 can you help out geu rae ? <eos>
 come to my office sometime <eos>
 to play go <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 extremes can relate to each other <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 you ' re early <eos>
 in order to withstand helplessness <eos>
 in order to withstand injustice and phoniness <eos>
 suk yool chose to keep his mouth shut <eos>
 he was erasing time <eos>
 by training how to numb himself <eos>
 he lost his smile <eos>
 and we lost him <eos>
 i started to miss his annoying chatter long ago <eos>
 but none of us could dare to give him advice <eos>
 it ' s been 17 months since we started working <eos>
 we knew clearly by now <eos>
 you had to withstand hardships by yourself <eos>
 but i still wanted to tell him <eos>
 " even if you lose a stone <eos>
 " the game goes on <eos>
 suk yool " <eos>
 october is already over get ready to hibernate <eos>
 ms ha <eos>
 yes be careful not to catch colds <eos>
 it ' s become cold <eos>
 you ' re early <eos>
 hi geu rae <eos>
 hello hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello hello <eos>
 hello hello <eos>
 day to succeed for a change isn ' t it ? <eos>
 what was the first item ? <eos>
 tourist site ? <eos>
 environmental conservation ? <eos>
 you got in trouble for that random report <eos>
 you ' ve sold socks and underwear <eos>
 what was next ? <eos>
 rice ? that was random too right ? <eos>
 i don ' t know what you ' re trying to sell <eos>
 rice or processed rice goods ? <eos>
 brown rice or health supplements ? <eos>
 you ' ll make it today <eos>
 mr oh didn ' t say anything <eos>
 hello mr oh <eos>
 mr oh today is the day of destiny for geu rae ' s proposal <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 it came ? <eos>
 let ' s see <eos>
 you made it you made it ! <eos>
 finance approved of the budget <eos>
 why ' d they do that ? <eos>
 congratulations geu rae <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 refreshing ! <eos>
 anyway good luck since you got the green light <eos>
 yes <eos>
 good luck ! <eos>
 yes sir ! <eos>
 treat us to coffee since you ' re in charge of a proposal for the first time <eos>
 yes i want americano <eos>
 what would you like mr chun ? <eos>
 latte ? latte <eos>
 it ' s sold out <eos>
 just buy four cups of anything <eos>
 yes <eos>
 it hasn ? t been approved yet ? <eos>
 don ' t worry it ' ll pass <eos>
 i thought they ' d approve it yesterday but it ' s late <eos>
 i ' m sure they ' re still on the budget <eos>
 since finance is fussy about a few categories <eos>
 i see <eos>
 check if the steel frame order has arrived <eos>
 ok <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 steel frame order <eos>
 yes ? <eos>
 ms sun <eos>
 hi young yi <eos>
 you must ' ve been to the sauna <eos>
 did you work late ? <eos>
 i stood up all night because of a bidding <eos>
 i forgot to take my makeup my face felt so tight <eos>
 you need to apply stuff at this age <eos>
 you still have great skin <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 i never have time to get skin care <eos>
 it ' s still improved a lot <eos>
 your loan interest is past due ms ahn young yi <eos>
 please check since you might experience disadvantages <eos>
 such as suspension of credit card <eos>
 why are you sighing ? <eos>
 i ' m fine <eos>
 shall we go for some coffee ? <eos>
 mr oh hi <eos>
 staring at the rain ? <eos>
 i heard the headquarters are reviewing your team ' s items <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i heard the group will expand their businesses from next year <eos>
 did you submit your item ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 all the newbies were told to submit it also <eos>
 what if your proposal makes it ? <eos>
 i doubt it <eos>
 that would bring more worries <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 do you still eat sandwiches alone ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 no we eat together too <eos>
 you know ? <eos>
 there ' s no excuse to trip him anymore since you ' re not suffering like before <eos>
 but it doesn ' t seem like you ' re tight either <eos>
 it sounds like <eos>
 you must be looking at young yi all day <eos>
 of course i haven ' t given up on you yet <eos>
 i ' ll do my best to bring <eos>
 you to my team next time <eos>
 it ' s my limit <eos>
 i can ' t really relate to others personally <eos>
 so seniors won ' t feel comfortable around me <eos>
 it ' s because you ' re a perfectionist <eos>
 right ? <eos>
 guys could have fistfights over who was <eos>
 right but make up easily at the sauna <eos>
 but what can girls do ? <eos>
 you never had such concerns right ? <eos>
 my blood type is o <eos>
 my blood type is o too <eos>
 you know what ? <eos>
 mr ma ' s blood type is o too <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 hanging in there ? <eos>
 yes ? <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 is the meeting over ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 something happened ? <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 we ' re in trouble <eos>
 the headquarters likes your item the best <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 that means trouble <eos>
 what will we do ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 what do the headquarters know ? <eos>
 how could they ignore experience and evaluate with a few pieces of paper ? <eos>
 it should be fair ! <eos>
 i thought of your idea too <eos>
 but i didn ' t proceed with it <eos>
 they think anything bold can become ideas items and businesses ? <eos>
 have you ever done a business before ? <eos>
 mr ma is rooting for resource team 3 <eos>
 he had been with them for a long time <eos>
 he must ' ve wanted to support his team <eos>
 the structure ' s looking good <eos>
 let ' s check the costs with mr chun yes <eos>
 mr chun look at geu rae ' s proposal <eos>
 and there ' s a rumor that mr ma failed with hr by a small difference <eos>
 so what would happen if headquarters took resource team 2 ' s side ? <eos>
 he ' ll think he ' s a real failure <eos>
 don ? t do it <eos>
 tell them you won ' t do it <eos>
 she worked overnight on it for a month ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 give it over to team 3 <eos>
 then what should we tell headquar ? <eos>
 hey ! <eos>
 we ' re the pros <eos>
 persuade them that our proposal has more potential <eos>
 yes <eos>
 email the person in charge saying you can ' t do it <eos>
 report to me directly after you do <eos>
 answer me <eos>
 what an arrogant one <eos>
 but they ' re both ideas from teams under mr ma <eos>
 he gives them approval too <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 did you forget about the iran case ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 it ' s similar think about it <eos>
 the team that backed him up failed <eos>
 what would happen if a female newbie ' s idea is chosen ? <eos>
 think of it as mr ma ' s longterm race <eos>
 they put so much effort into people who back them up <eos>
 office politics give you a headache right ? <eos>
 avoiding isn ' t the answer <eos>
 i checked it <eos>
 ours always changes so check the forwarded content <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 life itself is politics not just work <eos>
 you got to get used to it <eos>
 that way you can survive <eos>
 anyway mind your own business <eos>
 focus on your first business <eos>
 yes <eos>
 bring in big profits and treat us to a big dinner <eos>
 yes beef <eos>
 beef ? sounds good right ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 regular spandex can ' t be dyed in the manufacturing process <eos>
 but one international factory ' s <eos>
 spandex is dyed in acid dyes <eos>
 yes i ' ll send you the sample <eos>
 i ' ll sort out the rest and email it to you <eos>
 yes thank you <eos>
 suk yool coffee <eos>
 mr sung does me proud <eos>
 the us market isn ' t easy <eos>
 10000000 yards of sofa fabric <eos>
 the bosses showered me with compliments <eos>
 the factory is running fine right ? <eos>
 of course they said they can meet the deadline <eos>
 but <eos>
 i ' m worried <eos>
 it ' ll be tough with only our factory <eos>
 don ? t worry <eos>
 subcontractors would decrease our profits <eos>
 it ' s not like we can ' t do it <eos>
 nice nice <eos>
 what would we do without you ? <eos>
 hello <eos>
 you seem to be going through puberty <eos>
 you ' re so quiet now <eos>
 oh <eos>
 are you already in that phase at work ? <eos>
 that ' s early <eos>
 that usually comes after two years <eos>
 sir <eos>
 i don ' t think our own factory can do it without subcontractors <eos>
 even if they go allin there are other team ' s work too <eos>
 i don ' t think it ' ll be possible <eos>
 mr sung said he talked it over with the factory <eos>
 they said it ' s possible too <eos>
 don ? t worry <eos>
 i ' m sure mr sung knows what he ' s doing <eos>
 hot ! <eos>
 the data ? <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 that ' s from kotra <eos>
 yes <eos>
 it says in kazakhstan <eos>
 they greet you and say their names even if you ' re a stranger <eos>
 in kazakhstan ? yes <eos>
 what else ? <eos>
 when you shake hands you take a strong grip <eos>
 a strong grip ? what else ? <eos>
 you hug people you ' re close with <eos>
 hug ? <eos>
 what if you love them ? <eos>
 it should be on the next page next page ? <eos>
 but why are your ears red already ? <eos>
 you want a double sniff of my cologne ? <eos>
 oh ? <eos>
 what does it say next ? <eos>
 sales team 3 ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 change the person in charge ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 they said geu rae won ' t do <eos>
 resubmit it by mr chun and mr kim <eos>
 what ' s the reason ? <eos>
 he ' s a contract employee with less than a year to go <eos>
 it ' s not a longterm business <eos>
 it ' s a two month case and geu rae can pull it off with responsibility <eos>
 he ' s prepared thoroughly and no one can do ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 you really thought so ? <eos>
 you thought geu rae could take full responsibility ? <eos>
 no one thinks so here <eos>
 including the company rules <eos>
 i ' ll <eos>
 meet with the chief of planning <eos>
 chief of planning ? <eos>
 why do you keep causing trouble ? <eos>
 he ' s just a contract employee <eos>
 just resubmit it by the others <eos>
 there have never been any contract employees in sales <eos>
 so there are no rules for that <eos>
 no ? <eos>
 right they ' re all fulltimers <eos>
 if there are no rules couldn ' t we make a precedent ? <eos>
 precedent ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 the plan is to make a rule that it won ' t be allowed <eos>
 that will prevent these issues <eos>
 issues ? <eos>
 sir this is unfair <eos>
 geu rae ? mr oh <eos>
 an infrastructure is built for the companies and buyers for a new business <eos>
 the company ' s conclusion is <eos>
 geu rae a temp can ' t handle that <eos>
 related businesses are created <eos>
 even after the business ends <eos>
 it ? s the company ' s loss if the person in charge changes midway <eos>
 so it ' s absurd to exclude the person who created the new business to <eos>
 make the new infrastructure ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 i ' m not getting through to you <eos>
 i ' ll make it simple <eos>
 why would the company invest in someone who ' ll leave ? <eos>
 geu rae ' s been on that proposal for a while <eos>
 it ' s all useless if you ' re going to ignore it ! <eos>
 mr oh you shouldn ' t get emotional over this <eos>
 why would the company invest in someone who ' ll leave ? <eos>
 i think it ' s ok <eos>
 ask mr chun yes sir <eos>
 what ? yes <eos>
 ok <eos>
 how ' s this ? <eos>
 the conditions aren ' t bad but ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 let ' s go with insun <eos>
 shinsung is good but they have <eos>
 little experience and knowhow <eos>
 but their conditions are the best <eos>
 contact them yes <eos>
 and have a meeting first ? <eos>
 yes thank you <eos>
 sure <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 mr oh that ' s not fair <eos>
 it is what it is <eos>
 that ' s absurd ! <eos>
 you know how geu rae didn ' t even get enough sleep for two months <eos>
 but we take that ? <eos>
 submit it with my name ? <eos>
 no way ! i can ' t do that ! <eos>
 there ' s really any other way ? <eos>
 you saw how excited he was about it <eos>
 he ' s about to memorize all the kazakhstan street names <eos>
 he ' s about to get married to a bride there <eos>
 how could they treat geu rae like this ? <eos>
 since it ' s a company <eos>
 they can do that since it ' s a company <eos>
 but he worked so hard till now ! <eos>
 don ' t act like he saved the country or something <eos>
 he just worked for his salary <eos>
 so will you really do that ? <eos>
 tell them you won ' t do it <eos>
 give it over to team 3 <eos>
 email the person in charge saying you can ' t do it <eos>
 just do as mr ma says <eos>
 that will give you the least trouble <eos>
 this is no competition no matter how hard you try <eos>
 there ' s no chance of winning <eos>
 i ' m not saying just always back down <eos>
 you should know when to fight and when to back down <eos>
 i ' m not saying this out of worry for you <eos>
 i just don ' t want further trouble and mr ma going insane <eos>
 what threat was that ? <eos>
 nothing <eos>
 you think <eos>
 bosses know everything ? <eos>
 they don ' t know diddly <eos>
 they can ' t make the deadline <eos>
 wait and see <eos>
 the site won ' t sit and watch <eos>
 da in <eos>

 yes but <eos>
 it ' s a new company <eos>
 mr oh <eos>

 you can ' t be feeling sorry for him in front of a head of a family <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 just focus on the papers <eos>
 yes <eos>
 before too <eos>
 the person in charge should know what to do <eos>
 you prepared so much and kept asking others <eos>
 that won ' t do ! <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 go get the fax and scan it for turkey baek ki <eos>
 it ' s urgent <eos>
 typos <eos>
 maybe that ' s why it was disapproved <eos>

 the company ' s not paying you to do your business only <eos>
 what ? <eos>

 how can you do any project like that ? <eos>
 i know you care about your first business <eos>
 but i can ' t let you do that ignoring your current work you know why ? <eos>

 bye <eos>
 as i sweated like a dog <eos>
 the miserable two hours went by <eos>
 my body was shaking terribly till <eos>
 i returned to the waiting room to get dressed <eos>
 life is not easy for anyone <eos>
 this is ahn young yi in resource team 2 <eos>
 due to personal reasons i won ' t be able to ? <eos>
 ? continue with the business item <eos>
 thank you for the interest <eos>
 i request you to replace it with another business <eos>
 hi mr kim <eos>
 how have you been ? <eos>
 in front of the company ? <eos>
 business proposal season right ? <eos>
 you must be swamped <eos>
 yes i ' m waiting for approvals <eos>
 how ' s your business ? <eos>
 same old ? <eos>
 isn ' t it tough since it ' s not a franchise ? <eos>
 you know ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 is something wrong ? <eos>
 it was fine <eos>
 i was confident about pizza <eos>
 when i was a resident employee <eos>
 and since i ate so much on business trips <eos>
 it wasn ' t a name brand <eos>
 but rumors spread <eos>
 it was introduced on the internet too <eos>
 but business hasn ' t been good ? <eos>
 we closed it after a market opened <eos>
 i used the funds i received when i left work <eos>
 and also got a big loan <eos>
 i thought i ' d start a new life <eos>
 mr kim mr chun <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr oh hasn ? t taken care of it yet ? <eos>
 why hasn ' t he submitted it ? <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 geu rae ' s kazakhstan case <eos>
 i told him to change the person in charge <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 mr oh didn ' t tell you ? <eos>
 why won ' t he listen to me ? <eos>
 i made sure he ' d understand <eos>
 he checked with planning too what ' s he doing ? <eos>
 sir ? <eos>
 one of you two take it <eos>
 why are you acting so foolish ? <eos>
 i know you care about him <eos>
 he ' s a temp it ' s not realistic <eos>
 what does a person in charge do ? <eos>
 he takes responsibility until the end <eos>
 when mr oh comes in tell him to submit it <eos>
 bye <eos>
 bye <eos>
 hello <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 this is insane <eos>
 sorry there ' s no room <eos>
 ok go ahead <eos>
 maybe i should ' ve hung in there then <eos>
 go along with the politics <eos>
 maybe i should ' ve <eos>
 at least acted like i was lining up with the authorities <eos>
 i can ' t sleep <eos>
 out of regret <eos>
 i ' d go on 34 overseas <eos>
 business trips a month <eos>
 the kids wanted gifts thinking i went sightseeing <eos>
 but then <eos>
 i thought i was doing a great job as a trading man <eos>
 but it ' s all useless <eos>
 my wife is sacrificing so much <eos>
 i can ' t watch my kids grow up <eos>
 hey <eos>
 remember that time ? <eos>
 back then our business partner was something else <eos>
 i kept going to their embassy every day and asked for so much info <eos>
 it was when you were new <eos>
 we still talk about you over drinks <eos>
 right <eos>
 so much ambition <eos>
 we ' d grab them by the collar <eos>
 " give us the data " <eos>
 " i need to make a living too " <eos>
 it was like war <eos>
 i gave him a good shake <eos>
 he became so obedient <eos>
 trading men aren ' t ambitious like that these days <eos>
 you can ' t afford it now <eos>
 the company is like a battlefield you said ? <eos>
 don ' t quit until you ' re kicked out <eos>
 outside ? <eos>
 it ' s hell <eos>
 i ' ll have to go out to the battle <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 then i ' ll <eos>
 go back to hell <eos>
 don ' t see me off it ' s ok <eos>
 don ' t see me off <eos>
 we ended up drinking <eos>
 you should go back <eos>
 go on ok <eos>
 i should ' ve brought you a gift <eos>
 buy your kids a snack or something <eos>
 i ' m sorry about coming emptyhanded <eos>
 what is this ? <eos>
 just accept it <eos>
 take it bye ! <eos>
 bye <eos>
 bye ! <eos>
 buy your kids a snack or something <eos>
 i need to work again <eos>
 i want to find the line i left behind <eos>
 the overseas companies will still remember me <eos>
 i left and i was so mad back then <eos>

 mr oh <eos>

 i ' m sorry <eos>
 why are you dragging for half a day ? <eos>
 wouldn ' t she need time to calm down ? <eos>
 she worked on it for a long time <eos>
 you <eos>
 were you always this emotional ? <eos>
 don ? t act so soft just because she ' s the first girl <eos>
 hey mr jung <eos>
 yes <eos>
 don ' t you want to get promoted ? <eos>
 wow <eos>
 what a gloomy day <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 yes <eos>
 can ' t you give up ? <eos>
 then let ' s say i ' m asking you a favor on this <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 i have a promotion review <eos>
 let ' s support <eos>
 mr ma <eos>
 but none of us could dare <eos>
 to give each other advice <eos>
 it ' s been 17 months since we started working <eos>
 we know clearly by now <eos>
 you have to withstand hardships by yourself <eos>
 you were right <eos>
 my item ? <eos>
 my item <eos>

 you really think so ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i hadn ' t thought it out <eos>
 i already emailed the headquarters <eos>

 what ? <eos>
 they ' re coming ? <eos>
 where is he ? <eos>
 i told you we can ' t work ! <eos>
 mister <eos>
 we made it clear we can ' t do it <eos>
 it ' s just an impossible mission ! <eos>
 other teams have orders too ! <eos>
 we ' ve only been getting <eos>
 34 hours of sleep a day ! <eos>
 you want us to work the old machines ? <eos>
 the manager clearly promised me <eos>
 to make the deadline ! <eos>
 we know you forced us to do it <eos>
 you said we had no choice ! <eos>
 the manager promised me <eos>
 so you can go argue with him ! <eos>
 hey listen ! <eos>
 old machines are still machines <eos>
 he said they work too ! <eos>
 you guys are so ignorant <eos>
 what ? what ? <eos>
 ignorant ? <eos>
 if you don ? t go back to work today <eos>
 it ' ll all be your faults <eos>
 when sales makes an order <eos>
 the factory should just do it ! <eos>
 and it ' s been promised ! <eos>
 if you have the time and energy to do this <eos>
 you should go back and start working ! <eos>
 gosh let ' s go <eos>
 we were crazy to think we could get through to them <eos>
 fine ! <eos>
 do whatever you want ! <eos>
 we ' ll go on strike starting tomorrow ! <eos>
 let ' s go ! uh <eos>
 this is ridiculous <eos>
 how can you treat me like this ? <eos>
 you guys are all responsible for the loss with the subcontractors ! <eos>
 mr sung ! <eos>
 suk yool do something what ? <eos>
 you worked as an intern in ulsan right ? <eos>
 we can ' t get our work done like that <eos>
 persuade them so they don ? t go on strike <eos>
 what can i do ? <eos>
 you must be able to talk to them <eos>
 you said you know people at the site <eos>
 what can he do ? <eos>
 just leave it <eos>
 i ' ll make sure they take <eos>
 responsibility if anything happens <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 i ' ll take care of it <eos>

 ahjusshi <eos>
 if you leave like this <eos>
 if you go on strike <eos>
 it ' s your loss too <eos>
 loss ? <eos>
 you always valued the site but now you ' re one of them <eos>
 now that you sit in the office you <eos>
 can just make orders to the factory ? <eos>
 you can ' t make things happen just by forcing us ! <eos>
 don ' t you have a dad and a family ? <eos>
 come on <eos>
 can you work with an old machine ? <eos>
 ahjusshi excuse me boss <eos>
 there must be a misunderstanding <eos>
 misunderstanding ? <eos>
 my whole family relies on me <eos>
 how would kids like you working <eos>
 comfortably in the office understand that ? <eos>
 i ' m suk yool i went to the site last time <eos>
 i was born for the site <eos>

 bye young yi <eos>
 for generations my family <eos>
 well most of my relatives are bluecollar workers <eos>
 we know the value of labor and integrity of sweat <eos>
 we have pride in the site <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 ahjusshi ? <eos>
 ahjusshi <eos>
 you ' re still here <eos>
 did it hurt a lot ? <eos>
 i ' m ok <eos>
 you saw the man with the glove on ? <eos>
 he ' s my older brother <eos>
 he worked the machines with me two years ago <eos>
 he lost two of his fingers <eos>
 in the existing machine <eos>
 it causes an accident every year <eos>
 after the accident he went to the team for faulty goods <eos>
 can you work with an old machine ? <eos>
 my whole family relies on me <eos>
 how would kids like you working <eos>
 comfortably in the office understand that ? <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 it ' s not like we ' re trying not to work <eos>
 i just want to protect my hand <eos>
 my family depends on it <eos>
 my son ' s tuition depends on it <eos>
 if i ' m not well <eos>
 my family can ' t survive <eos>
 you said you have pride in bluecollar workers <eos>
 you said that ' s your family ' s background <eos>
 you should ' ve considered this <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yes baek ki <eos>
 i ? <eos>
 am so embarrassed of my specifications <eos>
 what ' s wrong with your specifications ? <eos>
 i know <eos>
 i found out today <eos>
 it ' s ? <eos>
 it ' s not your fault <eos>
 nor mine <eos>
 nor my specifications <eos>
 nor your past ? <eos>
 anyway <eos>
 i found out it ' s not our fault <eos>
 so ? <eos>
 cheers ! <eos>
 let ' s drink <eos>
 long time no see <eos>
 is your husband home ? <eos>
 he ' ll be probably drinking nearby <eos>
 it ' s tough right ? <eos>
 it ' s just that my husband can ' t accept the fact <eos>
 hi <eos>
 why ' d you come to my house ? <eos>
 you could just call <eos>
 don ' t do this <eos>
 how will you face your kids ? <eos>
 keep sober <eos>
 if you ' re drunk you can ' t do anything when new opportunities come <eos>
 it ' s dangerous to be drunk when you ' re successful <eos>
 but it ' s dangerous to be drunk when things aren ' t going well <eos>
 our team has a new employee <eos>
 he reminds me of you <eos>
 he works hard without procrastination <eos>
 but he ' s different from you <eos>
 he works hard but <eos>
 it ' s natural and he ' s passionate <eos>
 but still rational <eos>
 the young guy ' s not drunk <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 ok <eos>
 mr kim ? <eos>
 he started a business after quitting <eos>
 he just watched me get kicked out <eos>
 he started with three employees <eos>
 but he ' s struggling without an expert <eos>
 go see him <eos>
 was he fired too ? <eos>
 you know what it ' s like <eos>
 fire and getting fired <eos>
 come on no hatred <eos>
 there ' s no hatred <eos>
 oh the guy you mentioned <eos>
 who ' s not drunk <eos>
 yes <eos>
 make sure this doesn ? t happen to him <eos>
 it ' s not up to us <eos>
 i hope he succeeds <eos>
 that guy <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 are you home ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 ok <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes mr oh <eos>
 don ' t be drunk <eos>
 yes <eos>
 bye <eos>
 right <eos>
 i ' m not drunk <eos>
 you were right <eos>
 but realistically we can ' t give it to a contract employee <eos>
 then you go to the site ! <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 i can ' t be drunk <eos>
 even if i lose a stone <eos>
 the game must go on <eos>
 i couldn ? t do it <eos>
 i ' ll hire a subcontractor <eos>
 suk yool ! <eos>
 you were acting arrogant and what have you done ? <eos>
 you couldn ' t send the employees back to the site ! <eos>
 you shouldn ' t disregard the site <eos>
 we shouldn ' t give them work for the <eos>
 old machines and just badger them <eos>
 it wasn ' t possible to begin with <eos>
 mr sung must ' ve known it was impossible too <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 hey <eos>
 you better choose good subcontractors <eos>
 if you can ' t find them by today <eos>
 the factory can ' t ever meet the deadline ! <eos>
 mr sung ! <eos>
 do what you can to find subcontractors <eos>
 if you can ' t <eos>
 our performances will be bad and we ' ll have a huge debt <eos>
 that would mean trouble <eos>
 i ' ll find them <eos>
 it would ' ve been better to use the old machines <eos>
 sir this is han suk yool in fabric <eos>
 please work as hard as you can without the old machines <eos>
 we ' ll find subcontractors and fill in what we can <eos>
 ok thanks <eos>
 but it won ' t be easy to find subcontractors now <eos>
 we ' ll do our best <eos>
 thank you <eos>

 we ' ll come back to you shortly is that okay with you ? <eos>

 sorry i have a few more questions on the cost you ' re talking about <eos>
 i ' ve printed it out <eos>

 yeah it ' s neat and smart just perfect <eos>
 now you see that ? <eos>
 i like your jokes too young yi <eos>
 yes i ' m studying them hard these days <eos>

 i don ' t know <eos>
 i selected the subcontractors mmhmm <eos>
 they ' ll manufacture what ulsan couldn ' t within two weeks <eos>
 the contract is complete <eos>
 they ' ve been on it for three days so far <eos>
 sounds good <eos>
 i feel relieved now <eos>
 the ulsan factory also said they ' d work hard to minimize our losses <eos>
 sounds good <eos>
 you take charge of communicating with them from now on <eos>
 yes good job <eos>
 i ' ll go have a cup of coffee <eos>
 sure sure <eos>
 how about saturday friends ? <eos>
 i ' m not interested <eos>
 come on stewardesses i ' m saying <eos>
 they ' re smart kind and hot <eos>
 so we should go on group blind dates for work … <eos>
 why should we go on group blind dates for work ? <eos>
 what are blind dates ? <eos>
 it ' s the only way to meet girls <eos>
 the way to confirm your love for coworkers and an opportunity to exhale <eos>
 we need to hibernate <eos>
 are there any girls around us besides transvestites or handsome young yi ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what about me ? <eos>
 hello hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 the arrival is tomorrow right ? what time ? <eos>
 4:00 sir <eos>
 oh gosh he should just give up if the company opposes <eos>
 i need to finish the vietnam case and ms sun is too much <eos>
 it ' s just too much i mean think about it <eos>
 we ' ll start working late tomorrow <eos>
 we ' ll have to be prepared <eos>
 she went to pakistan on a business trip <eos>
 she asked our team for help too <eos>
 i guess sales team 1 isn ' t too excited <eos>
 yeah and the company isn ' t really either <eos>
 there was an earthquake in pakistan last month <eos>
 the pakistan government requested for assistance <eos>
 if we can lower the price and payment won ' t be immediate <eos>
 but ms sun just accepted that <eos>
 from a humanitarian standpoint <eos>
 so much work no effective results and the team isn ' t backing her up <eos>
 ms sun will suffer on her own <eos>
 she seemed to be exhausted <eos>
 but <eos>
 why were you talking about me ? <eos>
 better go <eos>
 suk yool those files from fabric … <eos>
 oh regarding those … <eos>
 don ' t you know what i mean by <eos>
 go do it since i chose this item ? <eos>
 is this item from mr choi ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 it ' s a solar energy development business for china <eos>
 mr choi worked on it for a whole year <eos>
 if we make the contract it ' s $05 bil business <eos>
 it won ' t be as hard as you think <eos>
 since this will back it up <eos>
 it ' s all set up so you just need to get the contract signed <eos>
 what do you mean this will back it up ? <eos>
 is this the first time doing business with china ? <eos>
 are you talking about connections ? <eos>
 solar energy development businesses are national projects in china <eos>
 i thought nothing was decided with poshin <eos>
 look <eos>
 they ' ll get this business <eos>
 mr choi ' s judgment is good enough to say that will work <eos>
 think it over this week and let me know on monday <eos>
 hi mr chun <eos>
 mr choi ? <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 why ' s he giving us such a big item ? <eos>
 take it <eos>
 if we pull it off it ' ll be worth 23 years ' performance results <eos>
 i don ' t feel good about it <eos>
 it ' s not like us to use connections <eos>
 didn ' t we do whatever we could ? <eos>
 if we don ' t do this they ' ll say we ' re totally incompetent <eos>
 also using connections is normal in china <eos>
 so what ' s there to feel bad about ? <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 this isn ' t about good will <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 using connections is normal in china <eos>
 but in many times it ' s not legal <eos>
 we could get in trouble <eos>
 and the bigger issue is the connections for this are strong <eos>
 failure to obtain the order of the solar energy business despite the connections <eos>
 could get our team who ' s in charge blamed <eos>
 and poshin obtaining this solar energy <eos>
 development business is out of our hands <eos>
 everything is possible if only they get this business <eos>
 should i treat this gum disease <eos>
 or just leave it ? <eos>
 but <eos>
 i like that about mr oh at times <eos>
 this isn ' t about good will <eos>
 failure to obtain the order of the solar energy business despite the connections <eos>
 could get our team who ' s in charge blamed <eos>
 mr chun <eos>
 hi <eos>
 i ' m good <eos>
 i don ' t know what ' s going on <eos>
 what ' s with mr choi ? <eos>
 how do you really think ? <eos>
 you really don ' t like it ? <eos>
 you want me to be honest ? <eos>
 mmhmm <eos>
 to be honest <eos>
 i want to do it <eos>
 if it succeeds <eos>
 our team will really become huge <eos>
 we ' ll be able to move away from the bathroom <eos>
 poshin has always been in the business <eos>
 in china so it ' s likely they ' ll get it <eos>
 it ' s also a big company <eos>
 but <eos>
 i don ' t know why mr choi … <eos>
 it ' s important for him too <eos>
 he could become vice president by its success <eos>
 vice president ? <eos>
 but backup is necessary too <eos>
 to prepare for the 1% possibility of failure <eos>
 i ' m sure he wants to use our <eos>
 team as his bullet and shield <eos>
 that ' s all the more reason mr oh won ' t do it <eos>
 there ' s no reason to at all <eos>
 mr choi ' s intentions are obvious <eos>
 it ' s totally different from the jordan case <eos>
 no need to stick to it <eos>
 i guess <eos>
 but i still want mr oh to do it <eos>
 since it ' s much more likely it ' ll succeed as you said <eos>
 if only we make it we ' ll … <eos>
 are you done ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you didn ' t go for the demonstration ? <eos>
 the china electronics researchers are coming for product demonstration <eos>
 i told you yesterday oh right geez … <eos>
 did mr oh leave ? <eos>
 yes he did <eos>
 he looked miserable with worries as if it was the end of the world <eos>
 but he made it there ? <eos>
 he said he needs to go to see if there ' s anything to sell <eos>
 he ' s coming now <eos>

 mmhmm <eos>
 with mr park ' s incident and the jordan case and all <eos>
 though i don ' t have to go <eos>
 you should ! <eos>
 working abroad is the highlight for us <eos>
 i think i should ' ve gone to congo when they told me to <eos>
 after i rejected that <eos>
 i haven ' t gotten any offers <eos>
 i don ' t even hope for america or europe <eos>
 that one refusal must ' ve made a bad impression <eos>
 i ' m sure that ' s not why <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>

 come on <eos>

 i ' ll go get some air <eos>

 i didn ' t want to get you in trouble <eos>
 i think youngmin will be better <eos>
 who do you think you are jerk ? <eos>
 what do you know about that <eos>
 company to say such crap ? <eos>
 crap ? <eos>
 oh right <eos>
 your nickname as an intern was dog <eos>
 stop acting like a crapping dog <eos>
 you pulled one thing off and got arrogant ? <eos>
 i think working with a lazy <eos>
 irresponsible company like chungsol is worse <eos>
 what jerk ? <eos>
 stop calling me " jerk " sir i have a name <eos>
 you should appreciate how i didn ' t embarrass you <eos>
 don ' t get emotional but look at the facts <eos>
 be rational and reasonable <eos>
 are you related to chungsol by any chance ? <eos>

 mr hwang should treat you to drinks <eos>

 are you putting it off to get married first ? <eos>
 yeah that ' ll be more stable <eos>
 dong sik got screwed again <eos>
 i don ' t think mr oh cares about <eos>
 others when he ' s focused on work <eos>
 if you work like a dog anyways isn ' t it better <eos>
 to have the results that shows ? <eos>
 he doesn ' t have a luck for a boss <eos>
 he always looks for work <eos>
 why that … <eos>
 but their team gets along <eos>
 is it a meetup to get along well ? <eos>
 a boss who procures items with results is preferable <eos>
 of course ! <eos>
 good for him and myself <eos>
 you get promotions and incentives <eos>
 people badmouth them but actually want such teams <eos>
 sales team 3 ? <eos>
 they keep asking for trouble <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>

 an ambulance came near the airport what ? <eos>

 the main reason is a sleeping disorder due to stress from overworking <eos>
 she ' ll need to be hospitalized for a few days <eos>
 with overtime work and the business trip <eos>
 it was too much <eos>
 just think of it as an opportunity to take a break <eos>
 it was too much <eos>
 i feel upset and guilty <eos>
 i was promoted <eos>
 really ? <eos>
 congratulations <eos>
 but what ' s with your expression ? <eos>
 actually we fought because of that <eos>
 i told her to quit since i got promoted <eos>
 she had a hard time <eos>
 maybe i was too hard on her <eos>
 so she ' ll quit ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 she didn ' t want to quit <eos>
 it ' s a big part of her since <eos>
 she ' s worked for 15 years <eos>
 she said she needs to protect herself <eos>
 to love her family <eos>
 mr oh we ' ll get going now <eos>
 ok i should go too <eos>
 i need to pick up so mi <eos>
 i ' ll call you next time <eos>
 thank you for your time <eos>

 thank you visiting <eos>
 mr oh dissuade ms sun <eos>
 the pakistan export case won ' t get much <eos>
 credit and the company doesn ' t like it <eos>
 i can ' t understand why she insists on it <eos>
 actually you two are similar <eos>
 anyway we need her <eos>
 tell her to get lots of rest without worrying <eos>
 tell her so she understands since you ' re close <eos>
 sure <eos>
 get going <eos>
 i ' ll stay a bit longer <eos>

 you scared me <eos>
 you ' ll have to stay for a few days <eos>
 mr um and mr cha came <eos>
 they ' re telling you to get plenty of rest <eos>
 they said don ' t worry about work <eos>
 worry ? <eos>
 you should delay the pakistan case for now <eos>
 get rest <eos>
 and work twice as hard when you ' re out <eos>
 maybe i shouldn’t do it <eos>
 i don ' t think i can do this one <eos>
 if it can ' t be delayed mr um and mr cha can do it <eos>
 or <eos>
 is it because your husband told you to stop working ? <eos>
 when i was thinking about quitting <eos>
 because of what he said <eos>
 i talked to mr lee <eos>
 and he … <eos>
 have you heard about ms sun ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 she told mr lee she ' d quit <eos>
 it must ' ve been withdrawn <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 then what about our promotions ? <eos>
 we ' ll have to wait longer <eos>
 i don ' t want to go to sales team 3 <eos>
 i want to work under you for a long time <eos>
 i thought of them as family and took <eos>
 care of their personal needs too <eos>
 they were only thinking of getting ahead <eos>
 they thought of my resignation <eos>
 as an opportunity <eos>
 they both had high hopes <eos>
 since i ' m sick and all i don ' t want to do it anymore <eos>
 it ' s because they haven ' t worked under you for a year yet <eos>
 mr oh who ' s working abroad always <eos>
 complimented you as an old subordinate <eos>
 it ' ll be different when he comes back <eos>
 just wait <eos>

 bye <eos>
 and about geu rae … <eos>
 i heard there was a switch in the person in charge <eos>
 sorry it ' s the company rule <eos>
 i tried my best but i couldn ' t help <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 the company is tough <eos>
 he did so much for it <eos>
 so you need to be strong <eos>
 it ' s not good for the company either <eos>
 if they keep changing contract workers <eos>
 you need to keep teaching them <eos>
 from the start <eos>
 let ' s get together for dinner sometime <eos>
 ok <eos>
 mr um <eos>
 yes <eos>
 about the pakistan case you two will continue with it right ? <eos>
 anything i can do to help ? what ? <eos>

 we ' re dying here <eos>
 i thought of them as family and took <eos>
 care of their personal needs too <eos>
 they were only thinking of getting ahead <eos>
 they thought of my resignation <eos>
 as an opportunity <eos>
 they both had high hopes <eos>
 how ' s ms sun doing ? <eos>

 fabric cotton cost: 296 <eos>
 cvc 253 <eos>
 tc 21 <eos>
 other parts $02 … <eos>
 we ' re selling blankets to pakistan ? yes <eos>
 328 so the 50000 <eos>
 yards would be $150000 <eos>
 isn ' t that expensive ? <eos>
 it sure is but i ' ve hidden that fabric ! <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 no one took this leftover 47928 <eos>
 yards which had different issues <eos>
 so extra funds aren ' t necessary <eos>
 $1 per each for manufacturing costs <eos>
 our factory guys will <eos>
 provide any lacking fabric <eos>
 ok <eos>
 so now we need a manufacturing line <eos>
 i ' ll take care of that somehow <eos>

 we ' re young and we ' re sacrificing <eos>
 our weekend for another team ' s work <eos>

 " the basics are really important " <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 " i ' ll drive a truck if i have to ! " <eos>
 " but i ' ll be moving like a snail ! " <eos>
 see ? <eos>
 only i ' d look bad <eos>

 talking so much made me thirsty <eos>
 drink mine <eos>
 i ' m ok <eos>
 let ' s go wrap up <eos>

 ok smoke <eos>
 see you later <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 i ' m impressed <eos>

 i ' ll treat you to drinks <eos>
 good day thanks ! <eos>
 take care <eos>
 good day <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 ok <eos>
 oh no ! <eos>
 how can you forget something so important ? <eos>
 did you forget something ? <eos>
 should i get mr oh ? <eos>
 all you care about is work <eos>
 we have 5 hours 34 minutes till sunday <eos>
 let ' s spend the next 5 hours like it ' s 15 hours ! <eos>
 let ' s go this way since mr oh ' s there <eos>
 hold on <eos>
 remember this passionate day <eos>
 let ' s forget about the past two days <eos>
 this is no good <eos>
 work shouldn’t be like this <eos>
 why ' d you sleep holding me ? <eos>
 you got into my arms <eos>
 geez <eos>
 you slept on the floor ? <eos>
 on the bed … <eos>
 i can ' t believe this <eos>
 just thank me <eos>
 you wouldn ' t let me rest and you want a compliment ? <eos>
 you and i both <eos>
 rest by doing work <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 that sounds like a nightmare <eos>
 don’t say that please <eos>
 gosh our new employees must ' ve worked hard <eos>
 here <eos>
 oh my ! <eos>
 it reminded me of how we worked on the china housing construction <eos>
 the human mind is so fickle <eos>
 you get ignored by team members you trusted <eos>
 find out their thoughts <eos>
 get sick <eos>
 and want to drop everything <eos>
 then because of these few pages <eos>
 life is all about change <eos>
 but <eos>
 what are you concerned about these days ? <eos>
 what ' s your worry ? <eos>
 what is it that you want to heal yourself with work ? <eos>
 i feel stuffy <eos>
 can you get some air ? <eos>
 our team is like a bullet <eos>
 and a shield <eos>
 mr choi is really <eos>
 amazing <eos>
 i hate myself for putting up with <eos>
 him when i know his intentions <eos>
 let me guess <eos>
 why you ' re doing this <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you want to see who wins right ? <eos>
 you think you ' re at the point to do that <eos>
 your unscientific views <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you think you ' re fighting with mr choi <eos>
 if you succeed with the poshin case <eos>
 he will have to acknowledge <eos>
 you and your team <eos>
 support is necessary since the <eos>
 vice president position is on the line <eos>
 aren ' t i right ? <eos>
 ok <eos>
 then how ' s this ? <eos>
 one thing is for sure <eos>
 with a $05 bil order promotion to a dept head is possible <eos>
 and after that <eos>
 you get the authority to use whoever you want <eos>
 that ' s the company rule <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 you still think he can ' t make it ? <eos>
 will i become a fulltimer if i continue working like this ? <eos>
 i told him he won ' t <eos>
 high hopes <eos>
 and irresponsible consolation are all useless <eos>
 the company is tough <eos>
 so you need to be strong <eos>
 one thing is for sure <eos>
 with a $05 bil order promotion to a dept head is possible <eos>
 and after that <eos>
 you get the authority to use whoever you want <eos>
 dong sik was screwed <eos>
 when will he get promoted if the leader keeps bringing unprofitable work ? <eos>
 should i wake the kids up ? <eos>
 oh let them sleep <eos>
 this is nice <eos>
 i ' ll ask my mom for some mustard leaf kimchi <eos>
 ok <eos>
 that ' s nice <eos>
 your mom ' s kimchi <eos>
 don ' t you hate me at times ? <eos>
 maybe you always do <eos>
 it ' s faster to tell you when i adore you <eos>
 i like it when you eat my food without complaining <eos>
 maybe i ' ve changed after i got married <eos>
 tell me <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you know … <eos>
 can i <eos>
 do something for someone ? <eos>
 can i <eos>
 butt in about someone else ' s life again ? <eos>
 you think it ' s right to <eos>
 help others ? <eos>
 you can forget about it now <eos>
 let eun ji go now <eos>
 just bury her <eos>
 what … <eos>
 do it just do it <eos>
 do whatever you want <eos>
 you haven ' t done anything wrong that ' s what i think <eos>
 you would do the same thing if you could do it all over again <eos>
 and i think that ' s right <eos>
 come on i ' m not that important <eos>
 exactly <eos>
 you only think about what you think is right <eos>
 everything else doesn ' t go however you want it to <eos>
 you ' re acting all influential <eos>
 you think you ' ll just be able to boss people around ? <eos>
 i thought you were saving the country or something <eos>
 the soup is salty <eos>
 don’t eat it it ' s ok come on <eos>
 he never gets sick <eos>
 he rarely catches a cold <eos>
 i can ' t believe he took a halfday off <eos>
 he ' s has a lot on his plate these days <eos>
 he helped with ms sun ' s work on the weekend <eos>
 he must ' ve overworked himself <eos>
 he ' ll have to make a decision by today <eos>
 i ' m worried <eos>
 you only think about what you think is right <eos>
 everything else doesn ' t go however you want it to <eos>
 maybe dad didn ' t go to work today <eos>
 maybe he slept in <eos>
 maybe he ' s going in late since he got promoted <eos>
 you can ' t go in late because of that <eos>
 maybe he ' ll get in trouble <eos>
 hey kids ! you should go to school <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yay ! bye <eos>
 bye ! <eos>
 come in <eos>
 jang geu rae ! <eos>
 it ' s not mr oh ' s style <eos>
 then why did he accept this business ? <eos>
 why sales team 3 ? <eos>
 what else ? <eos>
 switch to a fulltime position ? <eos>
 if i can help with anything … <eos>
 i ' m young yi ' s dad <eos>
 something ' s fishy <eos>
 he got bribed <eos>
 sang sik <eos>
 if he gets promoted he can become a fulltimer <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 i ' ll make it happen <eos>
 you only think about what you think is right <eos>
 everything else doesn ' t go however you want it to <eos>
 this is a surprise <eos>
 you didn ' t like that nice suit since it becomes wrinkly easily <eos>
 yeah just go classy today since you need all the luck you can have <eos>
 order good food and take a taxi there <eos>
 see you later <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 good thinking <eos>
 hi <eos>
 is mr choi in ? <eos>
 come in <eos>
 welcome <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 your concerns are leading to results <eos>
 it ' s a good thing it didn ' t lead to disappointment <eos>
 poshin joined the national solar energy business recently <eos>
 so the variable isn ' t reflected <eos>
 in the solar panel business <eos>
 so reflect that <eos>
 and have your team show what you ' ve got <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 it ' s been a long time since we ' ve worked together <eos>
 it feels great <eos>
 it reminds me of the old days <eos>
 and i feel passionate about it <eos>
 mr choi <eos>
 mmhmm <eos>
 i have a question <eos>
 why me ? <eos>
 why sales team 3 ? <eos>
 why you ask ? <eos>
 i ' m asking you because you ' re oh sang sik <eos>
 oh sang sik <eos>
 would there be any other reason ? <eos>
 let ' s have lunch later <eos>
 sure <eos>
 you decided to do it ? <eos>
 will it be ok ? <eos>
 you did good <eos>
 we can hopefully move away from the restroom <eos>
 go over this geu rae <eos>
 two items ? yeah <eos>
 this solar energy development is a $500 mil business <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 $500 mil ? <eos>
 how do connections work ? <eos>
 connections ? <eos>
 decrease our margin by controlling the original costs <eos>
 and increase poshin ' s profits <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 i ' d do anything you want to do <eos>
 but the fact that they might not get <eos>
 the power plant business is what <eos>
 you ' re concerned about too <eos>
 yeah as of now <eos>
 as of now ? <eos>
 there ' s a way to eliminate the risk factors <eos>
 the chinese government wants quality solar panels and facilities <eos>
 they want a company that does much <eos>
 business and can handle a big development <eos>
 from poshin ' s position <eos>
 the more solar panels they have <eos>
 the higher their chances to get the business <eos>
 the more solar panels they have ? <eos>
 hold on <eos>
 but why did the company before <eos>
 have such a small scale ? <eos>
 since it wasn ' t linked to the power plant business <eos>
 things changed recently <eos>
 so it depends on how we do ? <eos>
 so we actually have the upper <eos>
 hand regarding connections <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 stop the nonsense <eos>
 ask what poshin thinks about our plan dong sik <eos>
 find out if any quality solar panel <eos>
 exporters are connected to us <eos>
 yes <eos>
 there are some in the us and <eos>
 europe as well as here in korea <eos>
 ok <eos>
 read that carefully and <eos>
 support your bosses geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 don ' t act like the captain like last time <eos>
 if you act like a slacking philosopher again i ' ll fire you <eos>
 ok go out and work <eos>
 yes yes <eos>
 but what do you mean by " connections ? " <eos>
 it ' s better if you don ' t know it <eos>
 come on it ' s part of the business manual <eos>
 geu rae isn ' t like a pure organic being <eos>
 they say in china connections come first in business <eos>
 for the chinese personal relationships <eos>
 are more important than the law <eos>
 especially in business <eos>
 so give me an example ? <eos>
 don ? t simply think of it as bribery <eos>
 emotional bonding is the priority <eos>
 but it ' s definitely not mr oh ' s style <eos>
 then why ' d he accept this business ? <eos>
 and mr choi ? <eos>
 according to mr chun it ' s to get <eos>
 away from the restroom of course <eos>
 i hate the smell don ' t you ? <eos>
 it ' s time we move away <eos>
 here <eos>
 your dead project came back alive <eos>
 the headquarters said they want yours <eos>
 sir <eos>
 then what about mr ma ' s team 3 ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 congratulations <eos>
 congratulations ? <eos>
 we ' re really dead now <eos>
 what will we do ? <eos>
 be quiet <eos>
 we could be sent to sales team 3 ' s spot <eos>
 it stinks there <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 it ' s thanks to all of you <eos>
 i ' ll get you all a cup of coffee <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 it ' s been a long time <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 that you didn ' t seem to wear it for a long time <eos>
 oh this ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ' s been a long time ? <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 what what ? <eos>
 there ' s no water <eos>
 change the water young yi <eos>
 making the guy always do it is reverse discrimination <eos>
 that ? s what mr ha would say right ? <eos>
 my legs my legs ? <eos>
 alright <eos>
 wow <eos>
 thank you baek ki <eos>
 your dress shirt looks really nice <eos>
 wait wait <eos>
 this is <eos>
 pima cotton and this type of fabric <eos>
 is made with high standards <eos>
 it ' s a quality shirt <eos>
 easy to dye with a smooth finish <eos>
 psyche <eos>
 it ' s not that great <eos>
 still you must ' ve spent a small fortune <eos>
 but i don ? t think it ' s baek ki ' s style ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 why don ' t you use the 16th floor <eos>
 pantry instead of the 15th ? <eos>
 they don ' t have this <eos>
 you ' re not there nor young yi <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 young yi ? <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 this was that expensive ? <eos>
 no i bought it on sale <eos>
 so don ' t worry <eos>
 but you hadn ' t worn it <eos>
 so i thought you didn ' t like it <eos>
 no <eos>
 it ' s just a bit tight <eos>
 i worked out and lost weight to wear it <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 your coffee ? <eos>
 is it high quality ? <eos>
 sir <eos>
 i see chungsol is set as the supplier <eos>
 have you reviewed it again ? <eos>
 yeah why ? <eos>
 is there a problem ? <eos>
 the company with lots of delays ? <eos>
 i know <eos>
 mr sung contemplated on that <eos>
 so we decided to penalize them in case <eos>
 of another delay by the contract <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i told you an oral contract is enough <eos>
 but he added it in the contract <eos>
 gosh you ' re so meticulous <eos>
 is that true ? <eos>
 are you my superior or something ? <eos>
 am i obligated to report such things to you ? <eos>
 go check the contract <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you can ' t believe it right ? <eos>
 it upsets you to see me acknowledge <eos>
 the delays and do that ? <eos>
 i have much more experience <eos>
 than you dude <eos>
 no matter how hard you try <eos>
 you can ' t beat me you know <eos>
 what a joke <eos>
 i ' ve seen you drink during lunch before <eos>
 now you don ' t ? <eos>
 i don ' t think it ' ll be helpful for work later <eos>
 just drink a little <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 partner management could <eos>
 be the core to work <eos>
 they say it has changed but china <eos>
 is still all about connections <eos>
 it works despite the views on it <eos>
 i lived in china for five years <eos>
 all my chinese partners are on their own now <eos>
 they ' re all doing well <eos>
 i think businesses should be based at facilities <eos>
 the fulfillment ? <eos>
 those you leave at some point after making profit <eos>
 are no good anymore <eos>
 it should go for a lifetime <eos>
 you should make a lifelong friend too <eos>
 sang sik <eos>
 let ' s <eos>
 make this happen <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 and ? <eos>
 i knew you wouldn ' t have saved my number <eos>
 gosh <eos>
 no eight your number <eos>
 the number eight is a lucky number in china <eos>
 let ' s talk on the phone like we used to <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 sales team 3 jang geu rae speaking <eos>
 mr chun ? <eos>
 he ' s on the phone right now <eos>
 yes <eos>
 your number is ? <eos>
 i will contact you once we find the right one <eos>
 i ' ll tell him to call you thanks <eos>
 bye <eos>
 the products of solar team korea meet poshin ' s requirements <eos>
 so i got their number <eos>
 thanks sure <eos>
 sales team 3 kim dong sik speaking <eos>
 oh thank you <eos>
 i ' m sorry i didn ' t know it was the ceo ' s phone number <eos>
 oh yes <eos>
 we ' ll try our best with the supply too <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 china is proactive just like mr oh said <eos>
 yeah since it ' s a breakthrough for poshin too <eos>
 geu rae yes <eos>
 find the person in charge at the trade association <eos>
 and get detailed data on poshin yes <eos>
 have a good day geu rae <eos>
 i see she keeps contacting you <eos>
 she tells me how she ' s doing at times <eos>
 i think she ' s interested in you <eos>
 no <eos>
 be nice to her <eos>
 maintain her pride for her <eos>
 just reply to the text <eos>
 it ' s hard for me <eos>
 ha ? hard ? <eos>
 wow <eos>
 it ' s just a nice simple reply <eos>
 don ' t over think it <eos>
 you know <eos>
 the day we drank together after your blind date ? <eos>
 let ' s go for round two ! <eos>
 where shall we go ? round two <eos>
 geu rae ! <eos>
 where shall we go ? <eos>
 let ' s go next time <eos>
 ok <eos>
 bye bye <eos>
 oh see you next time <eos>
 see you <eos>
 if we see each other again yes <eos>
 but why are you following him ? <eos>
 i go in the same direction as him <eos>
 bye ! <eos>
 come on you should go <eos>
 where do you live ? <eos>
 right over there <eos>
 go now <eos>
 i ' m almost home <eos>
 ok go home then <eos>
 i ' m on my way home too <eos>
 where do you live ? <eos>
 you live here ? <eos>
 yes don ? t send me any more useless texts <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i ' ll send you useful texts from now on <eos>
 byebye ! <eos>
 how ' d you know my number ? <eos>
 i asked so mi ' s mom <eos>
 it ' s pressuring <eos>
 oh it ' s pressuring for captain jang ? <eos>
 you don ' t know how lucky you are <eos>
 mr kim <eos>
 treat her well she seemed nice <eos>
 it ' s not easy for a girl to be that aggressive <eos>
 it ' s not the time for me to be dating now <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 it is of course <eos>
 if you wait around you ' ll become a crappy old bachelor like me <eos>
 right mr chun ? <eos>
 of course there ' s a time for everything <eos>
 then is it time for me to become crap ? <eos>
 tell me no <eos>
 what did poshin say ? <eos>
 they like it as expected <eos>
 they want as much supply as possible <eos>
 i ' m looking into solar panel companies <eos>
 it ' ll take time to go over the us germany and korea <eos>
 right <eos>
 but mr oh ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 poshin doesn ? t have a middle manager <eos>
 what do you mean ? <eos>
 i called the number on the file <eos>
 and their ceo answered the phone <eos>
 their ceo ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 isn ' t it good if the ceo is on the same line ? <eos>
 he ' s taking care of it himself since it ' s important <eos>
 just like mr choi does it himself here <eos>
 because it ' s our business <eos>
 if there are no middle managers like us <eos>
 who will take responsibility if there ' s an issue later ? <eos>
 what issue ? <eos>
 mr oh what ' s wrong with you ? <eos>
 as soon as the solar panels are ready approve and submit it <eos>
 i told you it ' s all set <eos>
 the approval is just a formality <eos>
 no olives but onion ? <eos>
 a lot <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i will be back <eos>
 where are you going ? out to buy sandwiches for snacks <eos>
 are you ok ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 geu rae yes <eos>
 let ' s be prudent with work <eos>
 excuse me ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 hello <eos>
 i ' ll take your order <eos>
 i ' ll have four sandwiches <eos>
 one without olives lots of onion and heat them all please <eos>
 yes <eos>
 your team team the same taste as us <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 new employees will have to come for us to leave these errands <eos>
 your team seemed busy today <eos>
 we have urgent work to do <eos>
 mr choi ? yes <eos>
 though it ' s weird why mr oh accepted it <eos>
 right he doesn ' t like him <eos>
 but i think that decision was <eos>
 possible since it ' ll help the team <eos>
 i was angry and i resented him <eos>
 but i realized i needed suk yool and <eos>
 had to acknowledge him <eos>
 since there ' s a difference you can ' t overcome <eos>
 with just pride and stubbornness <eos>
 the leader has to think <eos>
 of the team members <eos>
 for mr chun mr kim and ? <eos>
 did mr oh say anything else ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 i see <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 baek ki yes <eos>
 the schedule has changed so you won ' t have to work late <eos>
 is that right ? <eos>
 mr kang <eos>
 i have a question <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 what changes when a team grows ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 so <eos>
 when the team ' s position changes or size grows ? <eos>
 you ' ll need that much more manpower <eos>
 the dept head can ask for more people <eos>
 then <eos>
 can you switch temps to fulltimers ? <eos>
 that should be possible <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 nothing <eos>
 see you tomorrow <eos>
 going home ? <eos>
 yes mr oh <eos>
 i heard your team is working late <eos>
 yeah geu rae was complaining again ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 i heard you started a new business <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 i ' m sure it won ' t happen <eos>
 but if i mean if you need my help <eos>
 let me know <eos>
 ok <eos>
 hi dong sik <eos>
 yeah it ' s on the desk <eos>
 it started coming off a few days ago <eos>
 maybe it really costs a fortune <eos>
 but it ' s definitely not mr oh ' s style <eos>
 mr choi ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 though it ' s weird why mr oh accepted it <eos>
 but i think that decision was <eos>
 possible since it ' ll help the team <eos>
 however i still have this doubt <eos>
 in my heart i can ' t get rid of <eos>
 why ? <eos>
 mr oh was insisting on it like never before <eos>
 mr oh ? <eos>
 it seemed like he decided not to make trouble about <eos>
 poshin not having a middle manager <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yes the model ? <eos>
 we focused on securing solar panels instead <eos>
 procuring the companies went smoothly <eos>
 regarding the supply costs and quality too <eos>
 poshin agreed that the conditions were great <eos>
 is this right mr oh ? <eos>
 mr oh sent a contract to poshin <eos>
 now only approval is left <eos>
 everything seemed to be going smoothly <eos>
 then something unexpected happened <eos>
 why these ? ! <eos>
 what ' s wrong ? <eos>
 connect me to poshin ' s ceo <eos>
 why me ? <eos>
 why sales team 3 ? <eos>
 i ' m asking you because you ' re oh sang sik <eos>
 oh sang sik <eos>
 would there be any other reason ? <eos>
 was this why ? <eos>
 mr choi ? <eos>
 we need to go through an agent ? <eos>
 and the commission is 25% ? <eos>
 the contract we sent didn ? t say that did it ? <eos>
 the ceo is saying it was agreed upon verbally <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 verbally with whom ? <eos>
 mr choi ? <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 so they ' ll take 25% out of our 3% margin ? <eos>
 then our profit would decrease to 05% <eos>
 we decreased the 5% margin to <eos>
 3% considering the connections <eos>
 but commission and an unnecessary agent ? <eos>
 the 3% was set reflecting the <eos>
 connections in the original cost <eos>
 but the sudden agent and commission <eos>
 from our margin could be a problem <eos>
 i have a different opinion <eos>
 it ' s not like the margin is zero <eos>
 and many of our businesses have 05% margin <eos>
 if we were to consider the potential growth of solar energy power plants <eos>
 i think this could be considered connections too <eos>
 i don ' t think there would be a problem <eos>
 well <eos>
 i have to say something at least <eos>
 i don ' t know what ' s going on for sure <eos>
 but i could feel disharmony <eos>
 just like trying to squeeze into unfitting clothes <eos>
 it felt unnatural <eos>
 i had so many questions <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 did you know about the tough conditions ? <eos>
 the adjusted costs were already reflected in the contract <eos>
 now it says our margin is lower and <eos>
 there will be an agent designated by poshin <eos>
 this is just too much <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 just approve and drop it <eos>
 then <eos>
 you knew all about it ? <eos>
 the profit may be small but the <eos>
 figures are fine within the company <eos>
 alright <eos>
 let ' s say we use an agent <eos>
 but don ? t you think the 25% commission is too much ? <eos>
 there ' s no problem ! <eos>
 sir <eos>
 i don ? t feel good about this business <eos>
 with the middle manager this and all ? <eos>
 if something happens <eos>
 our team will die <eos>
 come on who ' s going to die ? <eos>
 you don ' t need to worry so much <eos>
 please have some faith <eos>
 you shouldn ? t be on this case now <eos>
 wrap it up and focus on the solar energy power plant business ! <eos>
 that ' s why you ' re doing this anyway ! <eos>
 hold the china item for now <eos>
 will that be ok ? <eos>
 record all the calls <eos>
 related to china for now <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 geu rae yes <eos>
 you had contacted the resident <eos>
 employee in china before right ? <eos>
 yes mr suk <eos>
 have you talked with him ever since then ? <eos>
 i thanked him before <eos>
 and what did he say ? <eos>
 is he trustworthy ? <eos>
 i didn ' t think he was flaky <eos>
 call him <eos>
 ask him to find out what the agent poshin designated is like <eos>
 and whether there were other cases <eos>
 where an agent was suddenly introduced <eos>
 among poshin ' s items <eos>
 tell him to call me directly <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 it should be taken care of quietly <eos>
 ok ? <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 we need to go through an agent ? <eos>
 and the commission is 25% ? <eos>
 the ceo is saying it was agreed upon verbally <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 verbally with whom ? <eos>
 we decreased the 5% margin to <eos>
 3% considering the connections <eos>
 but commission and an unnecessary agent ? <eos>
 the 3% was set reflecting the connections in the original cost <eos>
 but the sudden agent and commission <eos>
 from our margin could be a problem <eos>
 hold the china item for now <eos>
 record all the calls related to china for now <eos>
 something ' s weird <eos>
 but it ' s definitely not mr oh ' s style <eos>
 then why ' d he accept this business ? <eos>
 and it ' s mr choi ? <eos>
 mr choi ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 yes sir thank you <eos>
 sir yes <eos>
 about chungsol ? <eos>
 do you know they were sued for order delays ? <eos>
 yeah mr sung gave me the report yesterday <eos>
 you knew about it ? <eos>
 but you still approved ? <eos>
 i told you a penalty condition for delays was added <eos>
 but a lawsuit is still not good <eos>
 so why should we work with them ? <eos>
 that ' s true <eos>
 but mr sung guarantees it <eos>
 so i ' m just trusting him <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 if a meticulous guy has such conviction <eos>
 there must be a reason for it <eos>
 sir i ' m back <eos>
 hi <eos>
 sir <eos>
 i want to buy a car <eos>
 pick one for me <eos>
 a car ? <eos>
 what you ' re going to buy something this expensive ? <eos>
 i ' ll sign a contract with my bonus <eos>
 i haven ' t spent it yet <eos>
 you ' ll pay the rest in installments ? <eos>
 did you have lunch ? <eos>
 oh ? <eos>
 hi <eos>
 hi <eos>
 see you at the garden <eos>
 baek ki <eos>
 what is it ? <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 so uh ? <eos>
 i thought the shirt was so expensive <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i already found out so i had to do something <eos>
 it cost $50000 <eos>
 and i really bought it at an outlet <eos>
 so no worries at all <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 sure <eos>
 see if it ' s your size <eos>
 shall i ? <eos>
 it fits perfectly <eos>
 take care of the heels <eos>
 i normally don ' t wear heels <eos>
 what you bought it for her ? <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 good job ? <eos>
 i was going to buy you a pair <eos>
 every time handsome young yi wears heels i feel uneasy <eos>
 your right heel is shaky right ? <eos>
 why ' d you observe my shoes ? <eos>
 i didn ' t observe them your shoes caught my attention <eos>
 your shoes did it not me <eos>
 your shaky shoes <eos>
 ok ok <eos>
 i ' m glad you ' re here <eos>
 let me hear your opinion <eos>
 ok let ' s say there ' s a company <eos>
 we buy it and sell it so we have the upper hand <eos>
 but we have to serve them we have to <eos>
 we should be on the receiving end <eos>
 and they ' d been sued for not meeting deadlines <eos>
 i ' m talking about that company <eos>
 but they still go ahead with the contract <eos>
 by adding articles to it <eos>
 what is this ? <eos>
 you don ? t know ? <eos>
 i don ? t know <eos>
 bribery is going on <eos>
 bribery <eos>
 i ' m sure of it <eos>
 bribery ? <eos>
 mr seok has called sir <eos>
 hi mr seok this is sang sik <eos>
 hello mr oh <eos>
 work is tough isn ' t it ? <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 the agent you asked about is a corporation <eos>
 but there ' s not much info since they ' re new <eos>
 i looked into poshin <eos>
 but they never used an agent before <eos>
 if necessary they had one to begin with <eos>
 and the 25% commission is absurd <eos>
 you mean it ' s a lot ? <eos>
 yes it ' s usually 1% <eos>
 and our margin was 3% right ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 according to those in charge <eos>
 considering the quality solar panel conditions <eos>
 and the situation where we had helped them <eos>
 we could have highered our margin <eos>
 and it ' s an urgent item for poshin too <eos>
 it ' s strange right ? <eos>
 ah no <eos>
 they must have their reasons <eos>
 thanks i appreciate it <eos>
 new ? <eos>
 our margin could ' ve been higher than 5% <eos>
 which is before reflecting connections ? <eos>
 so what do you think mr oh ? <eos>
 by any chance ? <eos>
 sir do you ? <eos>
 do you think mr choi is receiving a rebate ? <eos>
 mr oh you should drop this case <eos>
 i understand why you want to do it but <eos>
 the team could end up being eliminated <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 why are you hesitating ? <eos>
 you have another plan ? <eos>
 geu rae is on the line <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 how are things going ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 the new business ? <eos>
 what are you so worried about ? <eos>
 oh nothing <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 i don ' t know what ' s on your mind <eos>
 but just do it <eos>
 don ' t look back <eos>
 don ? t ask any questions and ? <eos>
 trust mr oh <eos>
 and do it <eos>
 why should i ? <eos>
 you said so <eos>
 that this business is meant for mr oh to build up the team <eos>
 if that happens and he becomes dept head you could <eos>
 have the chance to become a fulltimer <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 i don ' t know what you ' re concerned about <eos>
 but i wish <eos>
 you ' d do it <eos>
 switch to a fulltimer ? <eos>
 yes this is a good opportunity <eos>
 that ' s why <eos>
 if i insist the team could get in trouble <eos>
 but if i quit <eos>
 geu rae could be losing his last chance <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 there ' s no proof mr choi is receiving a rebate <eos>
 please give it some more thought <eos>
 yes mr oh <eos>
 if geu rae ' s on the line <eos>
 i want to do the best i can too <eos>
 if that happens and he becomes dept head you could <eos>
 have the chance to become a fulltimer <eos>
 hi <eos>
 where are you now ? <eos>
 i ' m on the way back <eos>
 i have something to tell you <eos>
 go ahead <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' ll get some air i need to think things through too <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 do you think mr choi is receiving a rebate ? <eos>
 geu rae is on the line <eos>
 if i insist the team could get in trouble <eos>
 but if i quit <eos>
 geu rae could be losing his last chance <eos>
 what is it why ? <eos>
 is it because of me ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 all the strange circumstances with this case ? <eos>
 things you wouldn ' t have ignored normally ? <eos>
 this time you ' re overlooking them <eos>
 is it because of me ? <eos>
 you ' re so arrogant ! <eos>
 please stop if it ' s for me <eos>
 i don ? t understand what you mean ! <eos>
 and what do you mean strange circumstances ? <eos>
 stop the nonsense and go work <eos>
 i couldn ' t understand why an agent appeared out of nowhere on the contract <eos>
 and a commission was requested too <eos>
 i call the shots <eos>
 i ' m saying this out of concern that <eos>
 i might ' ve affected your judgment <eos>
 arrogant kid <eos>
 who are you to say my judgment ? you ' re trying to save me <eos>
 you ' re <eos>
 trying to make me a fulltimer <eos>
 isn ' t that why <eos>
 you ' re working with people who you normally never would ? <eos>
 i don ' t want to put the team in danger <eos>
 please <eos>
 don ' t do it <eos>
 i don ' t know what you ' re thinking ! <eos>
 but if you want to criticize mr choi save your breath <eos>
 yes we don ' t get along <eos>
 but we can keep our personal lives and work separate ! <eos>
 he and i both ! <eos>
 you think work is a joke ? <eos>
 i think mr choi has ulterior motives <eos>
 i think he ' s using us <eos>
 don ' t be absurd ! <eos>
 he ' s produced much greater results than you ! <eos>
 also his contribution to this company is a lot greater than me ! <eos>
 he ' s worked for the company much longer than you or me ! <eos>
 he might hate me but he wouldn ' t <eos>
 hurt his team or company ! <eos>
 don ' t worry i ' ll make this work <eos>
 no one will have trouble <eos>
 i ' ll find a solution to get the best results <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 right it ' s a chance to save you <eos>
 so i ' ll do what i can why you ask ? <eos>
 if i don ' t do it now <eos>
 even if the chance comes next time <eos>
 i don ' t know if i ' ll feel the same way <eos>
 i told him he won ' t make it <eos>
 it ' s tougher than eun ji ' s times <eos>
 what ' s the use of high hopes <eos>
 and irresponsible consolation ? <eos>
 many people are desperate for <eos>
 those words or consolation <eos>
 still he won ' t make it <eos>
 go down <eos>
 your job is to work <eos>
 don ? t do anything besides that <eos>
 don ' t have suspicions about anything <eos>
 i can tell that you love your shoes <eos>
 don ' t be so overt <eos>
 you ' re embarrassing me <eos>
 well whenever i get new shoes <eos>
 i become more careful to walk ladylike <eos>
 any problems with r&d ? <eos>
 you can ask sang hyun for help if necessary <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 he said he has a close friend who could help <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 who is this ? <eos>
 i ' m young yi ' s dad <eos>
 oh yes <eos>
 hello <eos>
 i ' m jang baek ki and we started work together <eos>
 go ahead <eos>
 see you tomorrow <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i called mr shin <eos>
 let ' s go for some rice and soup <eos>
 i want to eat rice for a change <eos>
 don ' t be like that <eos>
 you ' re choking me <eos>
 your mom has a cold <eos>
 her bones hurt too with arthritis or something <eos>
 you should see her <eos>
 you can hate me <eos>
 but don ? t hate your mom <eos>
 how ' d you know where i worked ? <eos>
 i called mr shin <eos>
 i visited him recently <eos>
 why ' d you visit him ? <eos>
 just to say hi ok ? <eos>
 he said he met you there and you ' re doing well ? <eos>
 he was complimenting you <eos>
 i went to thank him <eos>
 i was late but i owed him that <eos>
 i kept myself from going because you were dead against it <eos>
 think about my position <eos>
 he lent me so much money so i ' d be <eos>
 a guy with no manners or conscience <eos>
 so <eos>
 what brings you here ? <eos>
 i heard you got a new bank account <eos>
 you paid it all off ? <eos>
 i was going to help somehow <eos>
 but i ' m sorry i couldn ? t <eos>
 don ? t waste your money <eos>
 and save as much as you can <eos>
 that way you can use it in an emergency <eos>
 oh yeah <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 wire me $500 if you can <eos>
 what should i do ? <eos>
 what should i do to escape from you dad ? <eos>
 wire it <eos>
 shall we have a drink ? <eos>
 this is my dad <eos>
 dot dot dot <eos>
 he really makes me speechless <eos>
 my dad was a soldier <eos>
 he was upset that i wasn ? t born a boy <eos>
 he always said " you should ' ve been born a boy " <eos>
 he always told my mom " don ' t put too much effort into the girl " <eos>
 they never helped with tuition <eos>
 so here it ' s " they went to school ? " <eos>
 i started working parttime from high school <eos>
 here ' s your pizza <eos>
 my dad quit and started this and that business <eos>
 he got swindled and went bankrupt <eos>
 then he took my paycheck too <eos>
 i went to college on a full scholarship <eos>
 i worked parttime and gave him money again <eos>
 but i couldn ? t get free <eos>
 i got a job before i graduated <eos>
 yes <eos>
 at samjung <eos>
 you know shin woo hyun ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 he was my boss <eos>
 but why ? <eos>
 how much is your yearly pay ? <eos>
 how are the benefits ? <eos>
 since it ' s a big company you can get a big loan right ? <eos>
 i ' m going to open a store <eos>
 i loaned money from <eos>
 the bank to help him out <eos>
 but it didn ' t stop <eos>
 there was no way <eos>
 then my dad <eos>
 went to mr shin <eos>
 without telling me <eos>
 mr shin <eos>
 taught me how to live as ahn young yi <eos>
 not a girl who ' s sorry for not being a boy <eos>
 good job <eos>
 china or arabian buyers don ? t think the person in charge would be female <eos>
 whenever you ' re in a meeting with guys always sit in the middle <eos>
 yes <eos>
 the fulfillment of labor and <eos>
 myself <eos>
 my future ? <eos>
 i started to value them <eos>
 until i learned my dad had borrowed money from him <eos>
 why ' d you do that ? <eos>
 why didn ' t you ask me ? <eos>
 you thought i ' d appreciate it ? <eos>
 you thought i ' d thank you forever ? <eos>
 i didn ' t want such circumstances to shake you <eos>
 shake me ? <eos>
 who ? <eos>
 that ' s what he said ? <eos>
 that i ' d have trouble without the money ? <eos>
 young yi drop it ! <eos>
 you ' re a hypocrite <eos>
 you did it knowing how pitiful i ' d feel <eos>
 i know you ' re enjoying this situation <eos>
 young yi ! <eos>
 i just yelled at him like i was crazy <eos>
 and <eos>
 it was over <eos>
 after quitting samjung <eos>
 i stayed home for about six months <eos>
 like i was dead <eos>
 i wanted to die <eos>
 then one day <eos>
 when i was watching a documentary on tv <eos>
 i realized i shouldn ' t die like that <eos>
 what documentary was it ? <eos>
 i don ? t know <eos>
 it was about company workers <eos>
 arguing over who ' d pay for lunch <eos>
 they looked pathetic <eos>
 i thought i should be among them <eos>
 i wanted to <eos>
 live my life <eos>
 did you like <eos>
 mr shin ? <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 yes <eos>
 shall we go see a latenight horror movie ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you can ' t watch horror <eos>
 uh ? <eos>
 i suddenly felt <eos>
 i could watch one <eos>
 then let ' s have some red <eos>
 blood soup afterwards <eos>
 that ' s too much for me as of yet <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 sure <eos>
 don ' t worry i ' ll make this work <eos>
 no one will have trouble <eos>
 i ' ll find a solution to get the best results <eos>
 right it ' s a chance to save you <eos>
 so i ' ll do what i can why you ask ? <eos>
 if i don ' t do it now <eos>
 even if the chance comes next time <eos>
 i don ' t know if i ' ll feel the same way <eos>
 please update the subsidiary material shipment status <eos>
 yes <eos>
 last time the factory manager complained due to the delay <eos>
 the fabric is on time and under process <eos>
 so don ? t worry <eos>
 yes as long as the materials are <eos>
 on time and the sooner the better <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 bye <eos>
 bribery <eos>
 i ' m sure that ' s involved <eos>
 i ' m sure of it <eos>
 gosh what is he thinking about now ? <eos>
 did he get yelled at gain ? <eos>
 i don ? t think it ' s right time for him <eos>
 hi <eos>
 what ' s going on with geu rae ? <eos>
 i don ' t know is something wrong ? <eos>
 how come you don ' t care ? <eos>
 is he an outcast ? <eos>
 is something wrong ? baek ki <eos>
 something must ' ve happened to geu rae but you don ? t know right ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i don ' t <eos>
 what could he be so worried about ? <eos>
 ok us newbies should get together for lunch later <eos>
 did you hear anything about him ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 i think mr choi has ulterior motives <eos>
 i think he ' s using us <eos>
 don ' t be absurd ! <eos>
 he ' s produced much greater results than you ! <eos>
 and his contribution to this company is a lot greater than me ! <eos>
 he ' s worked for the company much longer than you or me ! <eos>
 he might hate me but he wouldn ' t <eos>
 hurt his team or company ! <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 yes <eos>
 what are you thinking about now ? <eos>
 nothing <eos>
 yeah right <eos>
 i told you not to be a philosopher <eos>
 mr oh ? we finished our talk last night <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 do your work <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 if you or the company has any trouble because of me <eos>
 it ' s all useless <eos>
 your intentions <eos>
 to save me are more than enough sir <eos>
 hi mom <eos>
 you must be busy i ' ll make it quick <eos>
 ok <eos>
 which dry cleaners is your tie at ? <eos>
 i need to get it for you <eos>
 kim ' s or lee ' s ? <eos>
 lee ' s closed down <eos>
 oh right <eos>
 ok bye <eos>
 mom <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 i ' m busy hurry up <eos>
 i ' m busy hurry up <eos>
 mom <eos>
 do you want to do public services ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 when i took my intern test <eos>
 you complained that you couldn ' t go if i passed <eos>
 of course i want to ! <eos>
 bye <eos>
 come home early <eos>
 ok <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 mr seok <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hi where ' s mr oh ? <eos>
 he ' s away at the moment <eos>
 you can tell me if it ' s urgent <eos>
 i ' ll give him this recording <eos>
 i contacted poshin and rumor has it <eos>
 if this solar panel order works out <eos>
 the power plant business will practically take off <eos>
 then there ' s no reason for one international <eos>
 to take these conditions right ? <eos>
 don ' t we have a supporting role so that poshin can obtain the business <eos>
 by securing supplies ? <eos>
 right <eos>
 so i told mr oh there won ' t be <eos>
 any problem with a much bigger margin <eos>
 but poshin is requesting the margin <eos>
 we deserve as the agent ' s commission ? <eos>
 under the name of connections <eos>
 right <eos>
 mr seok <eos>
 i have a question <eos>
 then aren ' t the roles <eos>
 reversed right now ? <eos>
 i don ' t know how mr choi made that judgment <eos>
 but our company actually has the upper hand right ? <eos>
 mr seok <eos>
 geu rae ! <eos>
 see it to the end even if you don ' t think it ' ll work <eos>
 we have no choice but to run now <eos>
 did he just grab it ? <eos>
 i ' m disappointed in mr oh <eos>
 don ' t say that when you don ' t even know ! <eos>
 we ' re from the headquarters <eos>
 we heard your team has a recording <eos>
 what is this ? <eos>
 in life there are many things you start knowing how it ' ll end <eos>
 i have a question <eos>
 then aren ' t the roles <eos>
 reversed right now ? <eos>
 i don ' t know how mr choi made that judgment <eos>
 but our company actually has the upper hand right ? <eos>
 mr seok <eos>
 geu rae ! <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 what were you thinking ? <eos>
 what did i … <eos>
 connect me to mr seok <eos>
 our youngest one made a mistake <eos>
 no way <eos>
 we don’t think so at all <eos>
 i told you last time it ' s <eos>
 to make things clear <eos>
 don ' t worry <eos>
 recording ? <eos>
 come on i already deleted it <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 i ' ll treat you to soju when you come to korea <eos>
 have a good day <eos>
 mr chun and mr kim <eos>
 leave the room <eos>
 you couldn ' t believe me till the end ? <eos>
 mr oh i told you i ' d take care of it <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 listen carefully <eos>
 what you did today could <eos>
 actually put the team in danger <eos>
 why did geu rae do something so foolish ? <eos>
 even if he ' s not familiar … <eos>
 mr seok must be so nervous now <eos>
 it ' s like saying mr choi is corrupt <eos>
 and mr seok is in on it too <eos>
 mr seok is not in the position to take responsibility for his words <eos>
 so there ' s no telling what he ' ll do if he gets negative vibes about this <eos>
 and there ' s no proof for <eos>
 your distrust in mr choi <eos>
 if the case gets out of hand <eos>
 and mr choi is proven to have no fault at all <eos>
 our team and you will have to <eos>
 take responsibility since you started it <eos>
 geu rae found out ? <eos>
 mmhmm <eos>
 you ' re trying to save me <eos>
 you ' re <eos>
 trying to make me a fulltimer <eos>
 he thinks he ' s affecting mr oh ' s judgment <eos>
 so i think he wanted to confirm his suspicions <eos>
 he must ' ve wanted to save the team <eos>
 though it was immature <eos>
 i ' m sure he couldn ' t take it thinking it was his fault <eos>
 that fool <eos>
 he should ' ve discussed it with me <eos>
 uh mr oh <eos>
 i ' ve put mr seok at ease <eos>
 so things won ' t get out of hand <eos>
 in order to make sure of that <eos>
 we need to show him we ' re working again <eos>
 you ' re right <eos>
 we have no choice but to keep dashing now <eos>
 check each company ' s contract <eos>
 make sure it ' s checked thoroughly by others too <eos>
 double check poshin ' s contract <eos>
 and make sure the details are favorable to us <eos>
 what about the agent ? <eos>
 i ' ll go talk to mr choi <eos>
 yeah the agent was confirmed <eos>
 the details didn ' t exist in the previous files <eos>
 didn ' t i tell you the circumstances have changed ? <eos>
 i mean the solar energy power plant business <eos>
 i thought the connections would take care of that <eos>
 no that ' s the norm <eos>
 we need something additional <eos>
 categories were just divided with potential issues in mind <eos>
 just think of it all as connections <eos>
 then our profit rate from the <eos>
 solar panel business would be 05% <eos>
 that means it ' s nearly zero <eos>
 considering the business ' characteristics <eos>
 mr oh it ' s despite that <eos>
 mr choi <eos>
 i ' ve worked here for 28 years <eos>
 i grew with this company <eos>
 i always showed them results <eos>
 i mean always <eos>
 when the economy was bad and other companies were in trouble <eos>
 you know how we were ? <eos>
 we found a market using all my lines in china <eos>
 i saved the company each time <eos>
 i helped it grow and that ' s how it grew <eos>
 this was all possible because i had <eos>
 made familylike business partners there <eos>
 it ' s no different this time <eos>
 no matter how much we pay for the connections <eos>
 it ' s for the company <eos>
 i respect whatever way you had helped the company grow <eos>
 but please don ' t use that method <eos>
 for this case <eos>
 we ' ll proceed with the original contract we had sent <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 that ' s what the company approved <eos>
 and that i can accept <eos>
 so please help this business go smoothly <eos>
 please delete the details on the agent sir <eos>
 or we won ' t be able to work on this business <eos>
 if that ' s deleted <eos>
 we ' ll definitely get the second business too <eos>
 i ' ll make sure there ' s no problem <eos>
 with you becoming vice president <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 proceed as the original without the agent <eos>
 will that be ok ? <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 geu rae did you get replies for the emails you sent to domestic companies ? <eos>
 yes they ' re on your desk <eos>
 did you threaten mr choi ? <eos>
 will that be ok ? <eos>
 he ' ll accept it <eos>
 he has to become vice president <eos>
 your team is good <eos>
 securing that much supply within a short period of time … <eos>
 do you work well with them ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 why are you so nervous ? <eos>
 you still get nervous around me ? <eos>
 oh what do you think ? <eos>
 do you think it ' ll be impressive enough <eos>
 even without the agent details ? <eos>
 enough for poshin to want to give us the next business ? <eos>
 i <eos>
 my opinion is <eos>
 i don ' t know <eos>
 but <eos>
 but mr oh will make it succeed <eos>
 so please trust him <eos>
 he didn ' t tell you about geu rae ? <eos>
 mr park i asked chungsol so many times for the parts statement <eos>
 it was delayed then replaced to <eos>
 cheap items not once but many times <eos>
 i said no <eos>
 you don ' t care ? <eos>
 mr lee said it was ok … ? <eos>
 no please call me after you find a solution <eos>
 yes <eos>
 how much will the frigging mr sung get ? <eos>
 chungsol has to replace parts again <eos>
 yeah ? <eos>
 they must ' ve done so since they couldn ' t get the original ones <eos>
 they must ' ve done so ? <eos>
 you know it ' s not that simple the quality will … <eos>
 will be fine just be quiet <eos>
 they can ' t change it i ' ll have them come now <eos>
 hey <eos>
 have them come ? <eos>
 if you need them you go <eos>
 don ' t you know what the times are like ? <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 yes sir i heard about it <eos>
 no just proceed with it i ' ll get permission for it <eos>
 meeting the deadline is more important <eos>
 no you don ' t need to come <eos>
 i ' ll call you back in a minute <eos>
 jerk you made the factory come to a stall <eos>
 till when should i clean up after your mess ? <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 come on think of our relationship <eos>
 geez <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i received it <eos>
 i know i ' ve received a lot <eos>
 so i ' ll pay you back <eos>
 i ' ll keep paying you back ! <eos>
 geez ! <eos>
 ok <eos>
 i ' ll pay back all of it <eos>
 see you tomorrow evening <eos>
 i ' ll talk to you in person bye <eos>
 dang <eos>
 what is this ? <eos>
 i was hoping my suspicions weren ' t true <eos>
 oh my gosh <eos>
 he ' s really doing something fishy ? <eos>
 geez <eos>
 hi have you seen geu rae ? <eos>
 we couldn ' t have lunch together <eos>
 he won ' t answer your calls either ? <eos>
 no the office is vacant and his team must be super busy <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 maybe it ' s because of that <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 there ' s a chinarelated business <eos>
 mr ma and resource team 3 were on it originally <eos>
 but mr choi seemed to have given it over to sales team 3 <eos>
 the scale is quite large <eos>
 about $05 billion ? <eos>
 $05 billion ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 if it ' s a success the team could expand <eos>
 i ' m a bit disappointed in mr oh <eos>
 i thought he was against all of mr choi ' s intention <eos>
 i felt the same way <eos>
 but work is work <eos>
 but i ' m still disappointed <eos>
 maybe he just grabbed the rope given to him <eos>
 what are you talking about ? <eos>
 oh geu rae <eos>
 don ' t say whatever you want when you don ' t know what you ' re talking about ! <eos>
 don ' t … ! <eos>
 don ' t say whatever you want <eos>
 geu rae we … <eos>
 geu rae … <eos>
 right it ' s a chance to save you <eos>
 so i ' ll do what i can why you ask ? <eos>
 if i don ' t do it now <eos>
 even if the chance comes next time <eos>
 i don ' t know if i ' ll feel the same way <eos>
 i think mr oh accepted mr choi ' s case <eos>
 since he can make geu rae a fulltimer <eos>
 make him a fulltimer ? <eos>
 since he can ask for more people <eos>
 if he becomes head of the dept <eos>
 then how can that succeed ? <eos>
 i mean what can i do here ? <eos>
 what can we do ? <eos>
 probably nothing <eos>
 no i ' m sure there ' s <eos>
 something like ms sun ' s … <eos>
 no <eos>
 no suk yool <eos>
 this is different from that time <eos>
 i asked you to come play go why won ' t you come ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 ok come when you have time <eos>
 see you <eos>
 hello ? <eos>
 sales team 3 oh sang sik speaking <eos>
 this is mr choi ' s secretary speaking <eos>
 yes <eos>
 he ' d like to have dinner with you <eos>
 come on in <eos>
 i invited him <eos>
 i thought i was being too careless <eos>
 after giving responsibilities <eos>
 he ' s done a lot for the company <eos>
 and i felt i ought to treat him <eos>
 since i had chosen him as you said <eos>
 i don ' t know if he ' s serious for his age <eos>
 or shy <eos>
 i asked him to come for a game of go but he won ' t come <eos>
 oh you heard of this right geu rae ? <eos>
 " a good move for me could be <eos>
 good for the opponent too " <eos>
 let ' s eat the bass looks good <eos>
 geu rae has a lot of work today sir <eos>
 is that so ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i guess we have no choice <eos>
 let ' s eat together next time <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 come to think of it <eos>
 isn ' t there a reason you need this business too ? <eos>
 i had you come since you seemed to have forgotten it <eos>
 some people only think of winning <eos>
 and having the opponent lose <eos>
 they ' re bound to lose in the long run <eos>
 i like to lose and have the opponent win <eos>
 i don ' t like either winning or losing <eos>
 let ' s have a winwin situation <eos>
 you win and i win <eos>
 isn ' t there a reason you need this business too ? <eos>
 let ' s have a winwin situation <eos>
 you win and i win <eos>
 i ' ll do it <eos>
 however you ' d like <eos>
 but i can ' t just trust you <eos>
 like i did with lee eun ji <eos>
 so ? <eos>
 i ' ll make this case work no matter what <eos>
 so <eos>
 please give me a definite answer <eos>
 promise me that you won ' t ask our team to be responsible <eos>
 for anything related to connections <eos>
 promise ? <eos>
 should i sign a contract ? <eos>
 it ' ll be an arbitrary decision <eos>
 i ' ll take responsibility if there are any issues <eos>
 is that definite enough of an answer for you ? <eos>
 that ' s not enough ? <eos>
 i don ' t know what mr choi ' s thinking <eos>
 i was sure he chose our team as the bullets and the shield <eos>
 but he answers me so easily <eos>
 circumstances always change <eos>
 you made progress up until the point of signing the deal <eos>
 you ' ve been a much bigger success than mr choi expected <eos>
 your team is bullets for him now <eos>
 effective and fast bullets at that <eos>
 plus he ' s purposedriven <eos>
 you should just focus on your purpose too <eos>
 yes mr lee <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' ll see you there at 6:30 <eos>

 must i sacrifice myself when i ' m cleaning up for your mess ? <eos>

 since the spent expenses for the final report should be perfect <eos>
 i revised this to this <eos>
 ok looks good <eos>
 hello <eos>
 you should wrap up work in the office <eos>
 don ' t give kids stress <eos>
 you should quit smoking yourself <eos>
 hasn ' t young yi said you smell gross ? <eos>
 no she hasn ' t <eos>
 headquarters will do environment improvement survey right ? <eos>
 oh yes <eos>
 it ' s such a hassle <eos>
 nothing changes even if you tell them <eos>
 sir you said you needed to go to finance <eos>
 hello <eos>

 i ' m kang min gyung and this is <eos>
 our new employee lee yun suh <eos>

 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i ' m sorry give it to us we ' ll do it <eos>
 don ' t give the whole thing to him ! <eos>
 i ' ll do it i ' m sorry <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 they say the enemy of women are women <eos>
 she ' s being mean because she ' s younger and prettier <eos>
 what ' s wrong with putting the pen in her mouth ? <eos>
 personal habits in public settings aren ' t good <eos>
 she should ' ve been told off <eos>
 she was just cute <eos>
 hello <eos>
 cute ? <eos>
 she lacked the basics <eos>
 her boss lacked the basics <eos>
 she embarrassed her <eos>
 embarrassed ? <eos>
 i ' d like to ask young yi how she ' s felt till now <eos>
 mr kang <eos>
 i always thought your taste in girls was unique <eos>
 what do you mean ? <eos>
 you like stickskinny girls like her <eos>
 stiff girls that are coldblooded <eos>
 watch what you say <eos>
 i like girls who are proper <eos>
 you like giggly pushovers don ' t you ? <eos>
 come on get your words straight <eos>
 i like warm girls who <eos>
 can make others smile <eos>
 i think you like thin or curvy girls <eos>
 anyway the new employee is my type <eos>
 she ' s cute <eos>
 who do you like better baek ki ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i think ms kang would be fussy <eos>
 see ? <eos>
 your taste is weird <eos>
 yeah <eos>
 you ' re loyal man <eos>
 uh mr kang <eos>
 i ' m disappointed in your taste in women <eos>
 what ' s going on ? <eos>
 you ' ve been working here for over a year and you still don ' t get it ? <eos>
 the boss ' taste is the bible <eos>
 to corny jokes you go … laugh hysterically <eos>
 to his taste in food … " that ' s yummy " <eos>
 when he wants to smoke " i ' ll go with you " <eos>
 you need to adjust to his taste in music art politics and society <eos>
 but you know what ' s way on top of all that ? <eos>
 taste in girls taste in girls <eos>
 you should always say his is the best <eos>
 only if you like that boss <eos>
 hello <eos>
 hello <eos>
 mr kang still doesn ' t acknowledge it right ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 oh yeah <eos>
 his taste in girls is weird <eos>
 it ' s ready thanks <eos>
 young yi you saw them who was prettier among the two ? <eos>
 i thought the new employee was much more charming <eos>
 right ? <eos>
 see girls have accurate judgment <eos>
 so i want to learn to act cute <eos>
 since i lack that <eos>
 she ' s the best learner <eos>
 clearly different from booksmart baek ki <eos>
 different in every way <eos>
 oh i better go <eos>
 " learn to act cute … " <eos>
 we should be able to say that as company employees <eos>
 where did suk yool go ? <eos>
 i ' m glad i renewed my driver ' s license <eos>
 meeting at the waterfront of the han river … <eos>
 someone ' s watched a lot of movies <eos>
 nice <eos>
 gosh it ' s mr lee alright <eos>
 mr sung is so nervous <eos>
 now give him money money <eos>
 money for bribery <eos>
 what ' s that ? <eos>
 suk yool <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 hi geu rae <eos>
 getting off work ? yes <eos>
 ok <eos>
 is something wrong ? <eos>
 no <eos>
 ok see you tomorrow <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 is work going smoothly ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 it should go smoothly it has to <eos>
 see you tomorrow <eos>
 right life throws tough quizzes <eos>
 at you to make you helpless <eos>
 but it leaves you hints in funny places at times <eos>
 but of course there ' s no guarantee <eos>
 the answers you get are correct <eos>
 hi <eos>
 don ' t get up <eos>
 mr choi <eos>
 sit down <eos>
 you ' re working hard <eos>
 let me know if you need anything <eos>
 yeah mr kim will be losing some weight <eos>
 have a good day <eos>
 after that day between mr oh and mr choi <eos>
 our team seemed like they wanted to succeed no matter what <eos>
 we only focused on work <eos>
 we didn ' t think about anything else <eos>
 mr oh yes <eos>
 about this what will you do for after measures ? <eos>
 the sample test results … <eos>
 then one day … <eos>
 oh sang sik speaking <eos>
 headquarters ? <eos>
 mr oh sang sik ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 we ' re from headquarters <eos>
 we were checking on each affiliate ' s <eos>
 belttightening policies and got a tipoff <eos>
 tipoff ? <eos>
 in the headquarters ' monthly earnings statement <eos>
 there was a document regarding the issue <eos>
 of mr choi ' s business with china <eos>
 i heard your team has a recording <eos>
 recording what ' s that about ? <eos>
 the tipoff was from china <eos>
 it must ' ve seemed smart to stay out of the strange game <eos>
 though mr oh ' s consolation came right after <eos>
 words were recorded and when a <eos>
 contract employee pricked his conscience <eos>
 mr seok indirectly agreed without overt denial <eos>
 he must ' ve reported it to his boss with anxiety <eos>
 after receiving his report the manager in china had a hot potato <eos>
 he got it over to headquarters right away <eos>
 how many times are you asking me ? <eos>
 this is totally normal <eos>
 they ' re saying it ' s not right <eos>
 you ' ve always worked like this right ? <eos>
 i mean for a long time <eos>
 mr choi explained how he had worked for over many decades <eos>
 but the scale has gone overboard <eos>
 he thought he could persuade them <eos>
 but the reality was … <eos>
 we have all the data sir <eos>
 look here <eos>
 so didn ' t mr choi proceed with this <eos>
 business with strong conviction <eos>
 without consideration of the company ' s profits ? <eos>
 did any of the executives not have conviction ? <eos>
 then i ' ll rephrase that <eos>
 you said connections are a custom in that society <eos>
 then do you think this big scale is the norm ? <eos>
 it can be out of the norm depending on your viewpoint <eos>
 did you say " viewpoint ? " <eos>
 are you saying it could be viewed as the norm ? <eos>
 the trading business has many risks <eos>
 the connections uncertainty <eos>
 and losses are all analyzed <eos>
 and for potential relations as a business partner … <eos>
 partner management could be the core to work <eos>
 they say it has changed <eos>
 but china is still all about connections <eos>
 it works despite the negative views on it <eos>
 those you leave at some point are no good <eos>
 mr oh sang sik ? <eos>
 and for potential relations as a business partner <eos>
 connections have been made by investments <eos>
 i think the scale can be determined by <eos>
 the potential profit we can acquire <eos>
 then how come there are no connections <eos>
 to be found in your past work ? <eos>
 didn ' t you judge connections aren ' t justifiable ? <eos>
 and it seems the request to the china <eos>
 resident employee for investigation <eos>
 after mr choi ' s order was made is similar <eos>
 the president is here sir <eos>
 sir <eos>
 what brings you here ? <eos>
 you should ' ve called me <eos>
 i met with auditing team at headquarters <eos>
 mr choi it ' ll go with the proper procedure <eos>
 sir this is normal <eos>
 what ' s the problem with custom ? <eos>
 you ' re well aware of that <eos>
 and you said you trust me … <eos>
 i was aware of it but i don ' t <eos>
 know if headquarters was too <eos>
 prepare for anything you need to <eos>
 he was your choice <eos>
 oh you guys … <eos>
 mr jung good job <eos>
 you should get promoted <eos>
 ok <eos>
 go back and work <eos>
 go now <eos>
 no sir <eos>
 let ' s go <eos>
 mr choi ! <eos>
 i did it ! what ? <eos>
 i got the deal for the offshore plant epc case ! <eos>
 it ' s the first offshore plant case in korea ! <eos>
 we did it ! <eos>
 yes ! <eos>
 this is great ! <eos>
 we did it ! <eos>
 come here ! <eos>
 no sang sik you did it <eos>
 mr choi was appointed to unlisted affiliate one global <eos>
 by raising issues regarding connections <eos>
 and effort to improve the circumstances <eos>
 mr oh and sales team 3 <eos>
 weren ' t punished <eos>
 poshin stopped the solar <eos>
 heat power plant business <eos>
 it was in protest to issues about <eos>
 connections and mr choi ' s punishment <eos>
 geu rae <eos>
 go shred this <eos>
 things were unsettled in the office <eos>
 rumors about connections spread in chinese firms we had relations with <eos>
 so some teams suffered direct losses <eos>
 the reason could be found in mr oh ' s <eos>
 inflexible work style and side effects <eos>
 as the days went by <eos>
 he was blamed for everything <eos>
 that strong mr oh seemed to waver too <eos>
 and i knew <eos>
 that it all started with the careless <eos>
 words of a certain contract employee <eos>
 it ' s not your fault <eos>
 it ' s my fault <eos>
 i ' m the one who got mr seok <eos>
 to find out all the details <eos>
 i ' m the one who made the whole company nervous <eos>
 as well as you who knew nothing <eos>
 so i started it and ended it <eos>
 geez what ' s with you ? <eos>
 i told you not to be like this ! <eos>
 the one who should be responsible <eos>
 and take responsibility is <eos>
 the share and prerogative of those in that position <eos>
 i hate when you do this <eos>
 not knowing your place ! <eos>
 i just can ' t believe it <eos>
 it ' s just " omg omg " as kids say ! <eos>
 it ' ll be tough <eos>
 the scale is different from mr park ' s case <eos>
 you have one thing you ' re good at ! <eos>
 patience ! <eos>
 let ' s hang in there ! <eos>
 we ' re the tough sales team 3 ! <eos>
 look up <eos>
 stand tall <eos>
 the bituminous coal contract went according to your request <eos>
 we reviewed other companies … <eos>
 how can you ask to recheck the shipping contract right before production ? <eos>
 don’t you know verbal contracts have legal validity too ? <eos>
 isn ' t the contract regarding the <eos>
 chinese firm that even visited us many times ? <eos>
 that ' s right abd shipping <eos>
 right abd shipping among all those companies <eos>
 they want to review the whole contract <eos>
 this is all because of sales team 3 <eos>
 mr oh asked about the agent regarding connections through poshin <eos>
 and rumors must ' ve spread to all the chinese companies <eos>
 why that … <eos>
 mr choi leaving is making me anxious as it is <eos>
 let ' s look for another shipping company <eos>
 i ' ll look into it now <eos>
 negotiations are hard when it ' s urgent <eos>
 we can only choose from japanese firms <eos>
 their costs are so high <eos>
 man i ' m going to write on the noticeboard " leave mr oh ! " <eos>
 i ' ll select a good company <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 i know you ' re worried about mr oh <eos>
 but we ' re not the only issue here <eos>
 all the teams related to china will be influenced <eos>
 we could ' ve continued business with <eos>
 poshin since our relations were good <eos>
 don’t you know our team had no choice <eos>
 with headquarters ' auditing and all ? <eos>
 while we ' re on the subject <eos>
 did they have to find out that way ? <eos>
 it was wrapped up with righteous results and mr choi ' s punishment <eos>
 but was it worth it ? <eos>
 poshin stopped it as the issue got out of hand <eos>
 exactly <eos>
 a trading man set up the whole <eos>
 infrastructure and couldn ' t persuade the buyer <eos>
 think of the potential loss of $05 bil <eos>
 how can you influence all businesses related to china ? <eos>
 please check the noticeboard <eos>
 if you have a conscience you ' ll feel bad <eos>
 are you telling me to take responsibility ? <eos>
 that ' s not it <eos>
 i ' m checking who ' s at fault from the company ' s viewpoint <eos>
 i ' m telling you its position regarding customs <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 it ' s not your fault <eos>
 time will solve everything stop drinking <eos>
 no keep drinking today here <eos>
 mr choi fell into his own trap <eos>
 no one ' s at fault <eos>
 times have changed so how can he not ? <eos>
 right ? <eos>
 he hasn ' t changed <eos>
 neither have i <eos>
 shall i make you a boilermaker ? <eos>
 i ' ll make it for you <eos>
 when boilermakers and <eos>
 sales team 3 get together <eos>
 that ' s it a success <eos>
 mr oh said it ' s a must for sales <eos>
 here <eos>
 i ' ll feed you suk yool <eos>
 drink it my arms hurt <eos>
 there you go <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 here <eos>
 tissue tissue <eos>
 it wasn ' t intentional it ' s good <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 let go i have to wipe this off <eos>
 you don ' t have to <eos>
 oh gosh <eos>
 i ' m home <eos>
 why are you so late ? <eos>
 you drank again ? <eos>
 you know about drinking ? <eos>
 i know better than you <eos>
 you need a snack ? <eos>
 you must need one after drinking so much <eos>
 yeah ramen ! <eos>
 with some green onion yeah ! <eos>
 ramen at midnight ? <eos>
 that ' s all we have <eos>
 get up and eat this <eos>
 your dad used to cook his <eos>
 own ramen after drinking <eos>
 i ' m cooking it for you when <eos>
 i never cooked it for my honey <eos>
 bon appetit <eos>
 mr choi <eos>
 hi there <eos>
 it ' s really cold isn ' t it ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 how are you ? <eos>
 good <eos>
 how about you ? <eos>
 i ' m doing better than expected <eos>
 i worked for that company for 28 years and i was shocked when <eos>
 they had an issue with my ways <eos>
 they say an executive is someone <eos>
 who can see the stars on clouds <eos>
 when everyone is looking at the ground <eos>
 i thought it was ok to jump above <eos>
 the ground to get on the clouds <eos>
 how many people could possibly see the <eos>
 stars with their feet on the ground ? <eos>
 but i learned my lesson <eos>
 nevertheless <eos>
 the type of executive the company wants <eos>
 is a giant who can see the stars <eos>
 with their feet <eos>
 on the ground <eos>
 when i first met you mr choi <eos>
 i was sure you ' d be like that <eos>
 yeah ? yes <eos>
 i thought you were amazing <eos>
 i wanted to become like you <eos>
 thanks for not bringing up other <eos>
 issues during the auditing process <eos>
 i wanted to tell you that <eos>
 are you talking about the doubts regarding the rebate ? <eos>
 they weren ' t doubts <eos>
 they ' re your groundless suspicions <eos>
 yes <eos>
 that ' s why i couldn ' t bring it up <eos>
 it wasn ' t for your sake <eos>
 i just didn ' t have hard evidence though i had suspicions <eos>
 just like with lee eun ji <eos>
 i ' m glad you ' re still working <eos>
 it ' s hard to see results in the global service business <eos>
 but performance is key <eos>
 but things will be tougher for you <eos>
 since you affected china that way <eos>
 it won ' t be easy for you to <eos>
 work in one international <eos>
 is that so ? <eos>
 i don’t understand <eos>
 that ' s right <eos>
 mr choi was right <eos>
 we tried to work as usual <eos>
 but the company ' s atmosphere was still disturbed <eos>
 hi where ' s mr kim ? <eos>
 he ' s in a meeting <eos>
 can i see the items ' chart for sudan ? <eos>
 mr kim said he needs to give approval for everything <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 he told us not to show our data to anyone when he ' s away <eos>
 give me the data <eos>
 hey buddy ! <eos>
 our team worked on it too ! <eos>
 why can ' t i see it ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry i ' ll take care of it after i tell mr kim <eos>
 let me see the data <eos>
 mr kim it ' s so hard to see a simple chart <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 you want me to go up there again ? <eos>
 send it by messenger <eos>
 what are you trying to do now ? <eos>
 i get it <eos>
 oh ! <eos>
 is something wrong ? <eos>
 it ' s weird <eos>
 what ' s wrong ? <eos>
 about the import from laos <eos>
 the finance manager has approved it too <eos>
 but the chief of the headquarters hasn ' t yet <eos>
 it was turned down <eos>
 this is too much <eos>
 totally <eos>
 dang <eos>
 your team isn ' t even working on any businesses now <eos>
 sales team 3 oh sang sik speaking <eos>
 apparently there has never been so <eos>
 many complaints from china before <eos>
 the business team doesn ' t know <eos>
 how to take care of it now <eos>
 i ' m sorry to say this <eos>
 but all the businesses you were involved with before <eos>
 and all those related to sales team 3 <eos>
 are being rejected <eos>
 the losses for other teams are increasing <eos>
 are you saying we should <eos>
 take responsibility ? <eos>
 not necessarily <eos>
 still personal responsibility … <eos>
 anyway chinese companies are saying <eos>
 they can ' t work with one international <eos>
 since connections can be an issue <eos>
 so each team had to persuade them <eos>
 it wasn ' t the company ' s position <eos>
 but an arbitrary individual opinion <eos>
 but things aren ' t looking good <eos>
 so i think we need to make <eos>
 a gesture that we fired you <eos>
 but we couldn’t fire an employee <eos>
 that wasn’t even punished <eos>
 so the company is saying i have <eos>
 to leave for china to calm down <eos>
 that ' s not true <eos>
 no <eos>
 you know how they ' re treating our team <eos>
 i ' ll have to leave <eos>
 for our team to survive <eos>
 the company will obviously want the fastest easiest way <eos>
 but that ' s not the best way <eos>
 we can find the right way <eos>
 so wait till … <eos>
 then what ? <eos>
 what if all dies while waiting ? <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 so you ' ll hand in your resignation or something ? <eos>
 resignation … <eos>
 yeah resignation <eos>
 mr oh <eos>
 it ' s ok <eos>
 it ' s not like they can ' t run without me <eos>
 all of us employees are ready to submit it <eos>
 we always dream of submitting it every night <eos>
 and go to work with it in our pockets <eos>
 i ' ve been preparing myself mentally <eos>
 but … <eos>
 but … <eos>
 i ' m just worried about that kid <eos>
 go to bed it ' s late <eos>
 you won ' t get much sleep before work tomorrow <eos>
 can i <eos>
 quit work ? <eos>
 no you can ' t <eos>
 right ? <eos>
 are you quitting or getting fired ? <eos>
 i ' m quitting <eos>
 myself <eos>
 ok <eos>
 but you remember we have three kids right ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 receive your bonus before you quit <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 fridge <eos>
 tv <eos>
 two computers <eos>
 what are you doing ? <eos>
 things to buy before you quit <eos>
 you get an employees ' discount <eos>
 i hate you <eos>
 oh hi young yi ! <eos>

 you think they ' d take responsibility for the missing files after that ? <eos>
 if an issue arises because of that <eos>
 i ' d have to take responsibility <eos>
 responsibility ? <eos>
 you love responsibility don ? t you ? <eos>
 how on earth were you raised at home ? <eos>
 you trust no one and you ' re a selfish mess <eos>
 why do you go crazy over the chungsol case ? <eos>
 raised at home go crazy ? <eos>
 take care of the payment asap ok ? <eos>
 asap ! <eos>
 i can ' t even look at this dirty one <eos>
 they should take care of those who are here <eos>
 our steel team will start an additional <eos>
 business with discarded fridges <eos>
 and electronics related to <eos>
 resource ' s urban energy business <eos>
 i wish file transitions would be finished soon <eos>
 mr yoo and ms ahn will help as much as they can <eos>
 fiber will take care of the asbestos <eos>
 if resource gives us the files on asbestos <eos>
 we ' ll develop a malaysia <eos>
 export case through samgang <eos>
 geez why does everyone <eos>
 want resource ' s business ? <eos>
 a tf or transition every <eos>
 time things get exciting <eos>
 mr jung yes <eos>
 how are you doing work ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 we were on the\m ghana fast internet line <eos>
 installment case with sales team 1 <eos>
 since we ' re receiving the payment through mineral resources <eos>
 i ' d like resource to take care of it <eos>
 so why receive the payment through mineral resources ? <eos>
 bartering is from the stone age <eos>
 right mr jung ? <eos>
 oh right <eos>
 but apparently large inspection teams have come for french consultative groups <eos>
 regarding ghana resource development investments <eos>
 international projects to secure <eos>
 ghana energy develop ? lop <eos>
 develop what ? <eos>
 what are you trying to develop ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 i think it ' s a good opportunity for related businesses sir <eos>
 yes <eos>
 we ' ll research about the consumers and demands <eos>
 why should your team do that ? <eos>
 we can do that right mr jung ? <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 then go ahead <eos>
 i wish you could do it by tomorrow <eos>
 ms ? ms sun <eos>
 alright <eos>
 i have another meeting to go into so let ' s end it here <eos>
 wrap up individually too <eos>
 yes it ' s true that there ' s a price drop in raw materials as <eos>
 with the end of the super cycle <eos>
 but the market of canadian chromium nickel and platinum is still large <eos>
 you can read from the data that there will be <eos>
 a variety of synergy effects among this consortium <eos>
 so the schedule will be ? <eos>
 i ' m sorry i ' ll send you the detailed schedule by email as soon as possible <eos>
 ok thank you <eos>
 why couldn ' t i even say " development ? " <eos>
 is it over ? yeah <eos>
 this is pitiful <eos>
 ever since mr jung attacked him mr ma doesn ' t care about us <eos>
 what if we end up sitting next to the restroom ? <eos>
 be quiet let ' s just hope we don ' t <eos>
 i hope our luck gets better <eos>
 when will that happen ? <eos>
 the day you retire ? <eos>
 mr yoo you still haven ' t gone to london ? <eos>
 i wish dept heads were contract employees <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 geu rae is leaving soon right ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 mr kim will suffer the most after he does <eos>
 yeah you have to train interns and newbies <eos>
 that ' s if geu rae ' s successor comes <eos>
 right their team rarely had newbies <eos>
 but he really can ' t sign another contract right ? <eos>
 why would the company sign him on as a fulltimer ? <eos>
 ms sun and the team seemed to be making efforts <eos>
 but it won ' t produce any results <eos>
 i ' m sure they know too <eos>
 i thought i ' d just have to do my <eos>
 share despite who became my partner <eos>
 but i preferred someone <eos>
 i could communicate with <eos>
 i just wanted to tell you <eos>
 i didn ' t have the ulterior <eos>
 motives you ' re thinking of <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 no apologize after getting the job <eos>
 young yi <eos>
 i ' m sorry <eos>
 congratulations <eos>
 thank you <eos>
 it ' s sad isn ' t it ? <eos>
 the four of you started work together <eos>
 is there really no solution ? <eos>
 that ' s all i think about these days <eos>
 there isn ' t <eos>
 maybe you can start a movement <eos>
 movement ? <eos>
 the more the better you know <eos>
 the company can reconsider <eos>
 it if many people think about <eos>
 though it ' s not a solution <eos>
 start a movement ? <eos>
 mr ha meant we should try to make <eos>
 the company understand geu rae <eos>
 that he ' s worth keeping and he has to stay <eos>
 how ? <eos>
 yeah we can ' t have a presentation for him <eos>
 or put up posters like in college <eos>
 we can ' t go to upper management like in the dramas <eos>
 why not ? <eos>
 we can go talk convince and cry out loud <eos>
 this is like the last resort <eos>
 they ruin someone ' s life instantaneously <eos>
 why ' s it so hard to see the real of a person ? <eos>
 where are you going ? <eos>
 i have to do something <eos>
 i ' ll try the method that made me fool once <eos>
 i ' ll get going <eos>
 i think there ' s something i can do <eos>
 what ? <eos>
 hi young yi <eos>
 ms sun <eos>
 i have a favor <eos>
 i ' m fabric team 1 han suk yool <eos>
 it ' s been nearly two years since i ' ve started working here <eos>
 i had contacted you before because of an unpleasant issue <eos>
 i ' d like to apologize first <eos>
 the reason i ' m apologizing first <eos>
 is so people won ' t close the window <eos>
 just by the mention of my name <eos>
 i ' d like to ask an <eos>
 important favor today <eos>
 two year contract employee jang geu rae has started work with me <eos>
 and he ' s working in sales team 3 <eos>
 i hope he can become a fulltimer <eos>
 you can ' t ignore jang geu rae ' s performance <eos>
 well i know <eos>
 the interns were always complaining he started through <eos>
 connections and special treatment <eos>
 that ' s not necessarily true <eos>
 we ' d like a fair evaluation <eos>
 not special treatment <eos>
 he passed the presentation interview with me two years ago <eos>
 he joined sales team 3 <eos>
 he was the first of us to be in a <eos>
 presentation with upper management <eos>
 that radical presentation brought the <eos>
 jordan used car business to success <eos>
 we owe it to jang geu rae <eos>
 connections <eos>
 yes people called him the ged <eos>
 jang geu rae who used his connections to get the job <eos>
 so when we all entered as a fulltimer <eos>
 he joined as a two year contract employee <eos>
 he had to suffer various insults since his intern days <eos>
 but he worked harder than anyone else <eos>
 thinking of one international as our company <eos>
 is that for geu rae ? <eos>
 yes <eos>
 i ' m hoping it would help <eos>
 i ' ll make files proving his performance for our team <eos>
 yeah such portfolios are necessary for fulltimer transition evaluations <eos>
 i ' ll take a look when you ' re done <eos>
 yes sir <eos>
 he ' d come to work with us <eos>
 and leave after we do <eos>
 he worked so hard to make up <eos>
 for his lacking experiences <eos>
 when the item he planned he was excluded <eos>
 because he was a contract employee <eos>
 he gave up on it without a complaint <eos>
 please change it <eos>
 i ' ve <eos>
 never been so embarrassed of my specifications before <eos>
 i feel that way too <eos>
 how can specifications make someone ' s <eos>
 treatment so different from another ? <eos>
 why should one ' s effort be <eos>
 treated differently from others ? <eos>
 that must be reflected in regulations <eos>
 but transition to a fulltimer is impossible <eos>
 yes you ' re right <eos>
 but i ' m just asking you that he won ' t be evaluated unfairly <eos>
 in a standard evaluation <eos>
 due to mr choi ' s incident <eos>
 please sir <eos>
 the basics are key to evaluate one ' s adaptability to work life <eos>
 though it was hard to prove <eos>
 his basics at the starting point <eos>
 he has shown enough potential during the last two years <eos>
 jang geu rae must become a fulltimer <eos>
 he said <eos>
 " i ' ll sell this fabric with you suk yool " <eos>
 please help me keep that promise <eos>
 i ' ve had my shameful moments <eos>
 but i ' d like to keep that promise <eos>
 please <eos>
 please check the payment regarding the malaysia contact lenses <eos>
 yes the proposal review is complete it ' s doubled because of the stock <eos>
 i ' d appreciate a prompt reply <eos>
 each team can send one employee for <eos>
 college graduate intern selections <eos>
 wow new interns after two years <eos>

 nice to have a successor isn ' t it ? <eos>
 show them as the senior <eos>
 go <eos>
 yes i ' ll be back <eos>
 i ' ll be back go <eos>
 let ' s have a talk <eos>
 what kind of possibility ? <eos>
 headquarters will send guidelines to the company soon <eos>
 competent contract employees will be <eos>
 transitioned to fulltime positions <eos>
 it ' s an opinion among upper management <eos>
 so we will go by those guidelines too <eos>
 trends are changing <eos>
 please help out mr chun and mr kim <eos>
 i ' ll do my best too <eos>

 of geu rae ' s performance results <eos>

 hello ? <eos>
 see you three hours later in petra <eos>
 what ? why petra ? <eos>
 two roads diverged in a yellow wood <eos>
 and sorry i could not travel both <eos>
 and be one traveler long i stood <eos>
 and looked down one as far as i could <eos>
 to where it bent in the undergrowth; <eos>
 then took the other as just as fair <eos>
 and having perhaps the better claim <eos>
 because it was grassy and wanted wear; <eos>
 though as for that the passing there <eos>
 had worn them really about the same <eos>
 and both that morning equally <eos>
 leaves no step had trodden black <eos>
 oh i kept the first for another day ! <eos>
 yet knowing how way leads on to way <eos>
 i doubted if i should ever come back <eos>
 i shall be telling this with a sigh <eos>
 somewhere ages and ages hence: <eos>
 two roads diverged in a wood and i ? <eos>
 i took the one less traveled by <eos>
 and that has made all the difference <eos>
 alcatraz <eos>
 pharaoh ' s treasure <eos>
 the gateway to petra <eos>
 it ' s a path you have to pass by <eos>
 it was the central trade route in the ancient times connecting <eos>
 the persian bay to the east red sea to the south <eos>
 and mediterranean to the west <eos>
 incense road ? <eos>
 come to think of it <eos>
 my dream as an 18yearold <eos>
 was to travel around the world <eos>
 as i watched indiana jones 3 <eos>
 i became determined <eos>
 indiana jones 3 ? <eos>
 mmhmm <eos>
 i had forgotten about it <eos>
 but jordan reminded me <eos>
 of my dream <eos>
 dream ? <eos>
 as commerce decreased <eos>
 petra was forgotten for over 1000 years <eos>
 i see <eos>
 so i was thinking <eos>
 just because you forgot your dream <eos>
 doesn ' t make your dream vanish <eos>
 just because you can ' t see the <eos>
 road doesn ' t make the road vanish <eos>
 lu xun said this <eos>
 ? hope can ' t be said it exists <eos>
 nor can it be said it ' s not exist <eos>

 a road opens <eos>
 as you tread along it <eos>
 a road that doesn ' t <eos>
 open isn ' t a road <eos>
 roads are open to everyone <eos>
 but not everyone can have the roads <eos>
 this isn ' t the army for you to get proficiency pay <eos>
 you told me to catch me <eos>
 i risked my life and caught him <eos>
 this is wrong <eos>
 another road has opened <eos>
 and i ' m not alone <eos>
