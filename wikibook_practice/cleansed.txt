i have to swallow all that .
i ' m a duck .
ducks …
ducks think the first thing they see is their mom .
is that true ?
did you feed them ?
i ' m a duckling .
that ' s enough .
i ' m busy with my work .
i ' m sorry .
if someone calls ,  just tell them they ' re away and get their contact number .
is that ok …  ? yes ,  it ' s ok .
what about foreign calls ? foreign calls …
just hang up on them .
hang up ?
yes ,  just hang up .
check today ' s data and send me the report .
the updates are late .
you know me .
mr .  ha . yes .
what ' s with this email ?
oh ,  that . cameroon ' s complaint .
i know that .
but isn ' t it from last month ?
what ' s wrong with you ?
shall we go for a smoke ?
why ,  you !
i finished the presentation material .
i sent it to your emails .
already ? what presentation ?
about the african resource development investment business …
he said he was a presentation pro in college .
i saved it as pptx and ppt files just in case .
i sent it as a pdf file too , for your convenience .
size 14 ,  gothic font .
the subtitles are size 15 malgun gothic .
let me know if you don ' t like it .
i like it .
he ' s useful .
how about noodles for lunch ?
sure .
shouldn ' t you make reservations for eight ?
i made reservations for shinae and shiheim .
which would you like ?
i overheard them talking and called them .
i ' ll cancel one after you decide .
baek ki ,  you ' ll fit in great here .
pass the intern presentation and come to our team .
so ,  that ' s him .
mr .  oh ' s intern .
i don ' t know who he is , but he used connections .
someone made it into an ivy league .  .  .
.  .  . school by writing to the president .
the desperate reason why he had to get in moved him .
you know what happened ?
he dropped out after a semester .
why ?
because he couldn ' t keep up .
he only has a ged and no experience .
how do you know ?
hr .
treat him well .
he won ' t last long anyway .
uh …
yes .
uh …
i usually eat lunch alone .
i see .
and …
young yi .
i heard you pulled it off .
you ' re really racing ahead of us .
i ' m jang baek ki .
resource team intern .
i ' m jang geu rae .
please excuse me .
uh …
you joined late . we started 10 days ago .
i see .
it …
… just happened that way .
ask me if you have any questions .
like where the paper is …
the whereabouts …
you saw me .
you see everything here .
but they can ' t tend to it .
everyone ' s so busy .
yes ,  i ' ve learned that .
but …
… you must be nervous .
you can take off your jacket .
i forgot .
yes .
who is it for ,  ma ' am ?
how much is this new one ?
$824 for the whole suit .
is that made with gold thread ?
there ' s no difference from this .
the brand doesn ' t matter .
let ' s go for lunch .
what shall we have ? what shall we have ?
pasta ?
no way ,  bean paste stew .
you always have that .
yes .
aren ' t you going for lunch ?
oh ,  i ' m not very hungry .
are you a mama ' s boy ?
you can ' t do anything by yourself ?
you can ' t eat alone or …
i ' m not that stupid .
i ' m really not hungry .
i guess i ' m nervous .
come in .
thanks .
sorry ,  no room .
go ahead .
it ' s him .
he must have great connections to have become an intern without a test .
he must have a great resume .
maybe he went to an ivy league school .
ivy league schools must be easy to get into .
anyway this is unfair .
it ' s not fair at all !
hopefully they won ' t give special treatment to full-time employees .
young yi is already enough .
speak of the devil .
geu rae !
come on over .
bon appetite . thanks .
i ' m kim seok ho in the team next to yours .
i ' m jang geu rae .
hi .
geu rae .
come to our intern study group .
oh ,  sure .
why would he join us ?
huh ?
yes ,  young yi doesn ' t come either .
no .  1 ' s don ' t need study groups .
where did you go for college ?
harvard ? stanford ?
or maybe your family is rich ?
i ' m a curious person ,  you know .
i only have a ged .
that ' s shocking .
our company doesn ' t care about educational backgrounds ?
you ' re late ,  young yi .
hey . hi .
today ' s kimchi stew is really good .
i ' ll have pollack stew .
so that ' s why he kept following her .
can i have a seat ?
you eat well alone .
sorry about before .
sure .
huh ?
people usually say  " it ' s ok .  "
you say  " sure "  when no wrong was done .
i ' m so mad .
we studied so hard to make it in as interns .
we busted our behinds .
no ,  baek ki ?
huh ?
you ' re right .
to improve our resume .
you said so too .
you were a senior when we were freshmen ,  right ?
yeah .
a lot of us are from the same schools .
mr .  lee in it is from mine .
i wonder what his family is like .
he doesn ' t look all that rich .
anyway ,  you can tell his face value .
do companies still have preferential hirings for the poor ?
this may sound arrogant .  .  .
.  .  . but i feel cheated .
why did i join a company that would hire someone like him ?
maybe our school is a bit tough to get into ,  but isn ' t this too much ?
hey .
you are being arrogant ,  alright .
just treat him well .
he can ' t stay here much longer .
there ' s no position for him .
but i feel so cheated .
we really busted our behinds .
cheers !
there ' s no position for him .
a road opens as you travel along .
a road that doesn ' t open isn ' t a road .
roads are open to everyone .
but not everyone can have the roads .
you didn ' t think it ' s because of this ?
i mean the reason you keep failing the contest with your great skill .
master .
quit your part-time job .
i know you ' re poor and your dad is sick .
but you can ' t make it like this .
this is your last year as a korea go club student .
it ' ll be harder for you if you don ' t make it this year either .
so quit your job ,  geu rae .
my road ended there .
it ' s not because i lacked skills or luck .
or because i had a part-time job on the side .
or because my parents couldn ' t support me .
or because my mom became bedridden .  .  .
.  .  . after my dad passed away .
that would be too painful .
so i want to think i didn ' t work hard enough .
i want to think that way , even if it isn ' t true .
i ended up here because i didn ' t work hard .
i was abandoned because i didn ' t work hard .
you ' ll have to wear that one more day .
i was too busy to buy one .
take your time .
why are your eyes red ?
i couldn ' t sleep because of you .
you were tossing and turning all night .
i couldn ' t sleep because of your snoring .
bye .
i ' m used to the lobby already .
hello .
i was ready for the rat race .
how about you ?
yes ,  mr .  oh arrived at the airport .
now ?
ok .
i ' m going nuts .
henry said he would come tomorrow ,  why today ?
hello .
call mr .  oh .
you don ' t know .
here you go .
thanks .
right ,  i told you .
hello .
hey ,  man .
i said i was coming in today .
why ' d they send him today too ?
there was a miscommunication .
9:30 ,  kings hotel café .
i can ' t make it !
it ' s rush hour !
i was told you have to be there , no matter what .
i have to leave soon because of the .  .  .
.  .  . squids and come back tonight .
bye .
traffic report in the morning .
today ' s traffic is heavy .
the 405 is extremely jammed .
the right side of olympic highway is .  .  .
500 meters in 30 minutes .
huh ?
oh ,  no .
it ' s taking forever !
where are you ?
dong sik .
we have to get accustomed to the unfamiliar .
that way we can have a new experience .
we should move a step away from the fear .
sir ,  i was told you have to be on your toes or you ' ll be fired .
i ' m currently moving 12km/hour .
8km away from the meeting location .
i need 50 more minutes .
i ' ll be 30 minutes late for the meeting .
30 minutes ?
i ' ll hang up for a minute .
bye .

where is it ?
here you go .
ok .
department manager .  .  .

mr .  oh will be 30 …
huh ?
but …
he doesn ' t know anything .
yes ,  sir .
geu rae .
yes .

huh ?
crazy ,  huh ?
but there ' s no other way .
ok .
you have to be with him until mr .  oh gets there .

go .
ok .
show him the …
never mind .  he can ' t .
what ?
yay !
never mind .
what ' s good ?
maybe i ' ll write letters of apology in advance .
for me and mr .  oh .
i ' m in deep trouble .
it ' ll help if i write proper letters .
i knew it .
would i …
you have to be with him .
… have a solution ?
hey !
how could you send him ?
dang !
he can ' t even speak english !
he already left with the car , the rest is up to fate .
bye .
let ' s see if he pulls it off or not .
what ' s he doing ?
quiz ?
go ,  sir .
go ?
go ,  right ?
no ,   " baduk .  "
you taught him go ?
yes .
you ' re good ?
no .
i know up to here .
that ' s only thing i can do .
i was saved by the bell .
interesting kid .
ok . i understand you have a ged .
but you can ' t speak any foreign languages or have any skills or specifications .
that ' s rare these days .
what did you do before you came here ?
nothing ,  sir .
so you want to start now at 26 ?
yes .
you know you ' re really lucky ?
huh ?
i wouldn ' t have let them hire you had i been there .
even if you were obama ' s son .
i need someone to get the buyer to sign a contract now .
someone we don ' t have to teach .
i ' m sorry .
i can have you fired right away .
mr .  oh .
captivate me .
huh ?
sell yourself .
what have you got ?
my something .
my one thing .
nothing ?
something i ' m good at .
nothing ,  right ? effort .
so …
i ' ve never worked hard , so my effort .  .  .
.  .  . is unused and ultra brand new .
say what ?
i ' ll work hard .
i ' ll do my best .
i ' m not buying you .
hi .
hi ,  dong sik .
it went fine .
it worked out .
regarding the complaint from malaysia …
we can ' t pay for that !
what ?
it was that contract .
i ' m right .
that was sufficient ,  you know .
no ,  it was their fault , so we won ' t pay .
who do they take us for ?
yeah .
bye .
you know why i ' m not buying ?
hard-working guys are everywhere at work .
so you ' re no different .
my effort is different .
yeah ?
how so ?
the quality .
huh ?
i don ' t know what i ' m talking about . quantity too .
ok ,  let ' s see how different you are .
this is our team ' s data .
the folders are there , so organize it .
yes .
can you do it ?
yes ,  sir .
go on . yes .
ultra brand new effort with high quality and quantity ?
it ' s a new product ,  right ?
yes ,  it is .
you can pay in 6 months ' installments .
i don ' t have a credit card .
you ' re sure it ' s new ?
it ' s all mixed up .
but …
… even that could come in handy .
decide on a topic first .  .  .
.  .  . and add the content as you go .
there are some iffy files .  .  .
.  .  . which don ' t belong to anywhere .
mom !
what brings you here ?
i ' m busy now .
change into this .
mom .
you ' ll see when you become a dad .
when your kid suffers , you can ' t stop crying .
i ' ll get going .
take a taxi .
yeah ,  right .
have you eaten ?
of course !
young yi .
she gave it ,  huh ?
hi .
your team pulled it off .
mr .  oh . just sit down .
thank you for this .
no problem .
you have something to say ?
nothing .
hey . yes .
you know what team i ' m in ,  right ? yes .
you know we do everything ,  right ?
you can learn a lot .
yes .
keep that in your mind when your internship ends .
think  " i want sales team 3 .  "
so long .
bye .
when your kid suffers .  .  .
.  .  . you can ' t stop crying .
how are things going ?
you even know what you ' re doing ?
i ' m doing my best .
that ' s for school .
here you just bring the results .
yes ,  sir .
dong sik .
we ' ll have to check the fermented squid .
why ?
they mixed octopus in again ?
yes ,  there ' s a problem here . again .
they might have mixed in frozen octopus .
why ,  those octopus idiots !
they ' re denying it ,  but i think they are pranking us .
we need to check it today .
ok .
tell them we ' re manually checking and if it ' s mixed ,  we ' ll stop working with them .
ok . huh ?
manually ?
there ' s not enough people there .
i ' ll tell each team leader ,  don ' t worry . what ?  but .  .  .
why ,  those octopus idiots !
is the manager in now ?
shall i call him ?
he ' s connected .
hi sir ,  this is sang sik .
where are you ?
i have to tell you something .
yes .
yes ,  sir .
bye .
i saw the request for help with the octopus case .
squid case . you must be so busy .
you just came back from abroad .
i ' m on my toes already .
how come you have to cover for all the employees ?
aren ' t they hiring more people ?
oh ,  they hired someone ,  right ?
yes .
send me someone good .
we ' re going to send fermented seafood to the u . s .
if frozen octopus is mixed in , is it fermented squid or octopus ?
it doesn ' t matter which is more expensive .
the purity of the product is key .
if octopus is mixed in ,  octopus would embarrass one international .
find all the octopus .
what ' s with you ?
i didn ' t ask you to sell coolers in siberia .
yes .
baek ki .
i ' ll call the factory ,  so proceed .
yes ,  sir .
gosh ,  i ' m confused .
is this our job ?
i heard you help when they lack manpower .
yeah ,  one guy requested to work at a site .
but not a fermented seafood factory .
but young yi doesn ' t have to go since she ' s a woman ?
her team leader had them go .
see ?
there are other kind of people for this .
yes ,  sir .
alright .
bye .
what ' s this ?
mr .  oh .
geu rae .
what ' s with this ?
where ' s the one i made ?
i made it different to organize the iffy files .
will that be ok ?
no .
you have no friends ,  huh ?
huh ?
it looks like a diary for yourself .
i didn ' t have high hopes anyway .
geu rae .
let ' s go .
sorry we lack work uniforms .
we can ' t work like this .
why ' d you come then ?
make sure to keep it clean .
it ' s cold ,  so you ' ll need your clothes .
follow me .
there ' s no time and we can ' t help it either .
there are three 3 . 5-ton and two 4 . 5-ton trucks .
go in pairs and check for them inside .
do it asap before the seafood goes bad .
get into pairs . come on .
it ' ll be tough by yourself .
go on in .
there are fewer here .
come on .
it ' s freezing .
it stinks .
i didn ' t study toeic to do this .
i know .
i don ' t like this company .
let ' s take our time .

hey !
oh ,  my !

gosh ,  all the cars are gone too .
how come only you ' re left here ?
we have no cars and it ' s hard to catch taxis here .
how come only you ' re left here ?
geu rae …
hello .
hello ?

come on .
geu rae ' s here .
